      <title>An amazing note-taking system with Markdown and Git, Part 2</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/scottshipp/an-amazing-note-taking-system-with-markdown-and-git-part-2-2e9g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://dev.to/scottshipp/an-amazing-note-taking-system-with-markdown-and-git-part-1-48b1"&gt;Part 1 of this series&lt;/a&gt;, I explained why I gave up paper notebooks, email, and note-taking software like OneNote over the years. I had taken up with plain text files when we last left off. But I'd like to also make a few honorable mentions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-things-i-tried"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Other things I tried
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔬 Consider why people take notes for a moment. "Notes" are actually not "notes" at all at the end of the day. They are actually records of conversations. Reminders. Encyclopedia entries. To do lists. Time tracking devices. And a dozen other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've followed the "productivity obsession" of the internet age, then you know there are little pieces of software for each of these specific needs. Necessity is the mother of invention. And so we have time tracking software like &lt;a href="https://toggl.com/"&gt;Toggl&lt;/a&gt;. And we have reminder software like &lt;a href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/"&gt;Remember the milk!&lt;/a&gt; And we have wikis like &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence"&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt; or blogs like &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not surprise you to find out that over 15+ years, I tried all of these things and more. There are various small reasons why I abandoned each one in turn, but there is one huge reason that ultimately kept me from adopting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-walled-garden-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Walled Garden Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Walled Garden is both a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden"&gt;real thing&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform"&gt;useful metaphor&lt;/a&gt; for any closed platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ENyVOFcY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/se8wt5rehn8zfu3d2y63.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ENyVOFcY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/se8wt5rehn8zfu3d2y63.jpg" alt="A terrarium viewed from above"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with a closed platform like any of the above is that once you start using them, you sink cost into them the longer you do. Any content you enter becomes more and more entrenched over time. That content becomes no longer portable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is only &lt;em&gt;effectively captured,&lt;/em&gt; because it cannot be moved without expending such a large effort that it isn't worth moving it. But, often, it is actively captured by companies interested in profits, who use legal agreements, proprietary file formats, digital rights management platforms, and more to retain control over your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes you lose all that content entirely. I have experienced firstand what it is like for HP to buy out my online email provider and end my email address. I know the dangers of these systems firsthand. When my email address went away, so did my associated account on Facebook, because I couldn't reset the password or even change the address because it couldn't receive a confirmation email. And good luck trying to get any support from Facebook about that . . . because fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So walled gardens are a huge problem and &lt;em&gt;portability&lt;/em&gt; of any given solution has to take this problem into account. Besides that, what you end up paying over the years into certain platforms that are little more than repackaged open source can sting your conscience, especially when they don't give back to the community that made them possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I generally like to avoid walled gardens. That doesn't mean I think you should avoid them too. Nor does it mean that I always do, but it's worth pointing out that walled gardens have a cost, in both the small and the large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that brings us to the idea of standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-markdown-standard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Markdown standard
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was taking plain-text notes over the years, people were creating a wonderful thing: &lt;em&gt;markdown&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is, basically, a minimalist text-formatting scheme. It is one of those ideas that is so delicious that it found a wide audience fast. The adoption of markdown has been nothing more than spectacular. And its benefits are inarguable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;a href="https://dev.to/scottshipp/an-amazing-note-taking-system-with-markdown-and-git-part-1-48b1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; I talked about two major drawbacks I had with paper notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannot link to anything in the outside world (no clickable URLs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No images, audio, video, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had previously considered writing notes in HTML but—let's be honest—that is entirely impractical. So once I started using Markdown for other things, it didn't take long for me to want to put it to work in my notes. For the small price of adopting some kind of "compilation" stage in my notes, whereby they get compiled from Markdown to HTML, I could take notes that had all of the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portability (thanks to standards!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clickable links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code snippets with syntax highlighting in any language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;images, including screen shots and photos of whiteboard drawings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audio or video embedding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really like the ability to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bulleted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lists,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quote any text I want,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-how"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But how?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that brought me to the question of how to achieve this "compilation stage." Stay tuned for part 3 of this series, as that's what I will cover next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recursion, or How I Learned to Stop Thinking and Love the Thoughts</title>
      <author>Eamonn Cottrell</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:21:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sieis/recursion-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-thinking-and-love-the-thoughts-p59</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sieis/recursion-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-thinking-and-love-the-thoughts-p59</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not a genius, but I have managed to accumulate a fair amount of know-how about a lot of things from specialty coffee to writing fiction to web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I run into when I'm diving into a new (or old) subject is my seeming inability to stop prodding at its underlying roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking for a TV series to watch, I become lost in a rabbit hole of browser tabs, backstories and articles on the proper way to consume content that was intended to simply be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When siphoning through project ideas, I can easily become engrossed in the process of making and organizing the very spreadsheets and Notion documents that are meant to simply hold the list of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning new technical skills, I can lose hours scratching the details of a particular problem, debugging a function or searching for how to phrase a question I need to answer but don't quite understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those hours are precious to me. Perhaps the most important rhythm for my life today is balancing the active duty work time I'm responsible for with the intrinsically rewarding study time I need to grow in a way that allows for the maximum amount of quality family time with my wife and young children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a conundrum! I want my 36hr day, universe! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When revisiting recursion at its most basic level with a very rudimentary example this past week, I dove back into a topic that I've grasped on a number of previous occasions, but never truly grokked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I've got it this time. And it came way after I knew how this worked. I actually understand it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what made the difference? Slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-why-is-more-important-than-knowing-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding Why is More Important Than Knowing Why
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this out. It's like a loop, but better. Often touted as a more elegant, powerful solution than a simple for loop, recursion makes use of the ability to call functions within functions in a manner of bundling up the solution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function factorialize(num) {
  if (num==0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return num * factorialize (num-1);
  }
}

// factorialize(5) will return 120

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recursion calls the very function it's evaluating from within itself. It's pretty cool, but also mind-bending. In the first bit, we close a potential infinite loop by letting the function know that when num is equal to zero, just return 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that 0! = 1...(but be careful not to blow your mind apart if you're interested in exploring why this is actually true)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eh7quo-B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3b863eed38v6mdshhxnq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eh7quo-B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3b863eed38v6mdshhxnq.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's where I'd gotten before in my quest to know about recursion. It comes naturally to me to dive into video explanations and walkthroughs, but they often don't allow for any deep learning to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I am within the problem myself, I often lack the ability to fully understand its solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the problem at hand: we have a one line solution for the factorials of all numbers other than 0:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;return num * factorialize (num-1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What's happening here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Num is 5, so we're returning 5 * factorialize (5-1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so next time, we're returning 4 * factorialize (4-1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then 3 * factorialize (3-1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then 2 * factorialize (2-1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, 1 * factorialize (1-1)...which is 1 * 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where it's easier for me to box each of those lines back up in reverse order. We got down to our base case in the last line by taking the factorial of 0 which is 1. This gives us actual numbers to plug back into the previous line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factorialize (2-1) is equal to 1 * 1 at this point. So on that line, we then know that factorialize (3-1) is equal to 2*1. Parse through the final line of 1 * factorialize (1-1) slowly if this isn't clicking yet. This is the critical part where we start to take numbers back up through the recursive call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we've got numbers to plug into the line before it: 3*2.... and then that rolls up into the line before it: 4 * 6. And finally, that wraps back up into the first line since by this point we know that factorialize (5-1) evaluates to 24. So the final calculation gives us the final, real, answer: 5 * 24 = 120.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write it all out because to conceptualize it, I had to quite literally spell everything out before it clicked. There are a ton of YouTube videos that explain exactly this in more colorful ways, but until I broke it down piecemeal myself, I knew that it worked while not entirely understanding the depth of how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is emblematic of software development and computer programming in general. And many, if not all, things in life for that matter. Learning by doing, by building, by screwing up and trying again, is by far the most impactful method of acquiring even a modicum of skill in this fascinating world of ones and zeros.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thanks!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, thanks for reading. I'm incredibly interested in web development, and write about my journey here and on LinkedIn. I've produce a handful of podcasts that sap any of my leftover creative energy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow me on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eamonncottrell/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EamonnCottrell"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;; I've resigned to lite participation on these two social networks :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building and measuring a sign up funnel with Supabase, Next.js, and PostHog</title>
      <author>Phil Leggetter</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:08:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/posthog/building-and-measuring-a-sign-up-funnel-with-supabase-nextjs-and-posthog-2hh9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/posthog/building-and-measuring-a-sign-up-funnel-with-supabase-nextjs-and-posthog-2hh9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the number of software frameworks and services available to help with developer productivity and feature building, it's never been a better time to be a software developer. One of most important things you'll have to build, whether building a SaaS, developer tool, or consumer app, is a sign up flow that begins on a landing page and ideally results in a successful sign up. The purpose of this sign up flow is to get as many real users through to being successfully signed up on your app or platform. So, it's important that you can measure whether your sign up flow is converting and where any potential sign ups are dropping out of that funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll create a simple sign up flow in a Next.js app, starting with a Supabase example for authentication. We'll then look at how you can instrument that sign up flow using the &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/integrate/client/js"&gt;PostHog JavaScript SDK&lt;/a&gt; and create a sign up &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/user-guides/funnels"&gt;funnel visualization&lt;/a&gt; within PostHog to analyze the success - or failure - of the sign up flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-you-begin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before you begin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application in this tutorial is built entirely upon open-source technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; is feature rich, Node.js open-source React framework for building modern web apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://supabase.io/"&gt;Supabase&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source alternative to Firebase offering functionality such as a Postgres database, authentication, realtime subscriptions and storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://posthog.com"&gt;PostHog&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source product analtics platform with features including feature flags, session recording, analysis of trends, funnels, user paths, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow this tutorial along, you need to have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://posthog.com/signup/self-host"&gt;self-hosted instance of PostHog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://app.posthog.com/signup"&gt;sign up for PostHog Cloud&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/hosting/overview"&gt;self-hosted instance of Supabase&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://app.supabase.io/api/login"&gt;sign up for a hosted Supabase account&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easier to get up an running with the cloud hosted options. If you want to go with self-hosted then the &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/self-host/deploy/digital-ocean"&gt;DigitalOcean PostHog 1-click deployment&lt;/a&gt; makes getting started with PostHog much easier. For Supabase, &lt;a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/hosting/docker"&gt;the Docker setup&lt;/a&gt; appears to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bootstrap-sign-up-with-supabase-auth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bootstrap sign up with Supabase Auth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than building sign up from scratch, let's instead start with an existing Supabase-powered example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the following in your terminal to bootstrap a Next.js application with pre-built sign up and login functionality:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--example&lt;/span&gt; https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-examples/tree/bootstrap/supabase-signup-funnel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output will look similar to the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-examples/tree/bootstrap/supabase-signup-funnel
✔ What is your project named? … nextjs-supabase-signup-funnel
Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/leggetter/posthog/git/nextjs-supabase-signup-funnel.

Downloading files from repo https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-examples/tree/bootstrap/supabase-signup-funnel. This might take a moment.

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.

Initialized a git repository.

Success! Created nextjs-supabase-signup-funnel at /Users/leggetter/posthog/git/nextjs-supabase-signup-funnel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You'll be prompted for a name for your app and the files will be downloaded into a directory with that name. The directory structure of your app will look as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── README.md
├── components
│   └── Auth.js
├── lib
│   └── UserContext.js
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── api
│   │   ├── auth.js
│   │   └── getUser.js
│   ├── auth.js
│   └── profile.js
├── .env.local.example
├── style.css
└── utils
    └── initSupabase.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;components/Auth.js&lt;/code&gt; is the sign up, login, magic link, and forgot password component that makes use of Supabase Auth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;lib/UserContext.js&lt;/code&gt; provides functionality to get the current user from within a component wrapped in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;UserContext /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, if a user is logged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pages/_app.js&lt;/code&gt; a Next.js &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app"&gt;custom app component&lt;/a&gt; used to initialize all pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pages/api/*&lt;/code&gt; serverless API endpoints used within the Supabase authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pages/auth.js&lt;/code&gt; is the authentication page that uses the &lt;code&gt;Auth&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pages/profile.js&lt;/code&gt; is a page used to demonstrate server-side rendering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.env.local.example&lt;/code&gt; environment variables/configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt; basic styling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;utils/initSupabase.js&lt;/code&gt; initializes a &lt;a href="https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client"&gt;Supabase client&lt;/a&gt; used to interact with Supabase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we understand the basic structure of the bootstrapped application, let's get it up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one last piece of setup that's required before running the app is to create a Supabase project, set some auth config, and add the credentials from that to a &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt;. To create the &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; .env.local.example .env.local
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, head to the &lt;a href="https://app.supabase.io/"&gt;Supabase dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to create a project. Click the &lt;strong&gt;New project&lt;/strong&gt; button and you'll be presented with a "Create new project" dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Mb0rm7Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ej3f0sziococid8iulj6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Mb0rm7Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ej3f0sziococid8iulj6.png" alt="Supabase Create new project dialog"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may need to select an Organization. You will need to enter details for a project name, database password, and choose a deployment region. Once done, click the &lt;strong&gt;Create new project&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll then be presented with a page showing &lt;strong&gt;Project API keys&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Project Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TzlLf-Lb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h1g8t7fkovwiam0rrv37.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TzlLf-Lb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h1g8t7fkovwiam0rrv37.png" alt="Supabase Project API keys and Project Configuration"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update the contents of &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL&lt;/code&gt; value to be the URL from &lt;strong&gt;Project Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY&lt;/code&gt; value to be the API key tagged with &lt;code&gt;anon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Project API keys&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, within the Supabase dashboard project settings select &lt;strong&gt;Auth settings&lt;/strong&gt; and add &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/auth&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;Additional Redirect URLs&lt;/strong&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CrXSLHg---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iurxtsq1s8sen2fl9ljh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CrXSLHg---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iurxtsq1s8sen2fl9ljh.png" alt="Supabase Auth settings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Supabase configuration in place, we can run the app with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can then navigate to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000/auth&lt;/code&gt; to try out the Supabase authentication functionality including sign up, login, login/sign up with magic link (email), and forgot password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5i9mNRwm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a0quiorsjnzr7n9l1rje.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5i9mNRwm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a0quiorsjnzr7n9l1rje.png" alt="Supabase basic authentication app UI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're signed up and logged in the UI will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b7TpKtBk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ro8mqjchmfi4oxyqk31n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b7TpKtBk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ro8mqjchmfi4oxyqk31n.png" alt="Supabase Auth signed in example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll focus on sign up for our application, so try out the sign up with email and password functionality as well as the magic link sign up (note magic link emails for a single email address can be sent once per 60 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you're familiar with Supabase Auth functionality, we're ready to start to build a simple traditional sign up funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-a-sign-up-funnel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build a sign up funnel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to instrument and measure a sign up flow. So, let's create a very simple sign up flow as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User lands on the main website landing page which has two CTAs (call-to-actions) of &lt;strong&gt;SignUp&lt;/strong&gt;. One in the header and one in the landing page hero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User clicks on one of the sign up buttons and is taken to the sign up page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User enters their details to sign up and submits the form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User receives registration verification email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User clicks the link in the email and successfully signs up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#signup-flow-landing-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Signup flow landing page
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll keep the landing page really simple. Create a new file, &lt;code&gt;pages/index.js&lt;/code&gt;, with the following content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curlPostCmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
curl -d '{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"\}' \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -X POST https://api.awesomeapi.dev/data
`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curlGetCmd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
curl -d https://api.awesomeapi.dev/data/{id}
`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;520px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;96px auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;14px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SignUp&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Instantly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;functionality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SignUp&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/code&amp;gt; something Awesome&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curlPostCmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/code&amp;gt; something Awesome&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curlGetCmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;©️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As planned, the page has two CTA &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements that send the user to the &lt;code&gt;/auth&lt;/code&gt; page for sign up. One button is in the header and one is in what you could class as a "hero" location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in an "Awesome API" landing page that looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zzXmce9L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x010i2njcdg7zlyfu7ne.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zzXmce9L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x010i2njcdg7zlyfu7ne.png" alt="Awesome API example app landing page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to rebrand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that a landing page is in place we have all the assets required for a basic sign up flow that we want the user to successfully navigate through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3167LWcm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1xna3dmswd7es9e2q9p5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3167LWcm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1xna3dmswd7es9e2q9p5.gif" alt="Supabase Next.js sign up flow animation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#integrate-with-posthog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Integrate with PostHog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user can now sign up with our app but there are a number of potential drop-off points within the funnel. So, let's integrate the PostHog JavaScript SDK to instrument the user sign up journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add two new environment variables to &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; that will be used with the PostHog JavaScript SDK:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY=your_posthog_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=your_posthog_host
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The value for &lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt; can be found via &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt; in the left-hand menu of your PostHog app, underneath the &lt;strong&gt;Project API Key&lt;/strong&gt; heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value for &lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST&lt;/code&gt; is the public URL for your running PostHog instance. If you're using cloud, this is &lt;code&gt;https://app.posthog.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the required config in place we can install the PostHog JavaScript SDK:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; posthog-js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new file, &lt;code&gt;utils/initPostHog.js&lt;/code&gt;, and within it add code to initialize the PostHog JavaScript client:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;posthog-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initPostHog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;api_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The file exports a single function, &lt;code&gt;initPostHog&lt;/code&gt;, that checks to ensure that the current runtime is the browser and, if so, initializes the PostHog JavaScript client with the config we've just stored. It also returns the &lt;code&gt;posthog&lt;/code&gt; client instance so we can use within our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostHog JS has an &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/integrate/client/js#autocapture"&gt;autocapture&lt;/a&gt; feature that automatically captures browser events (this can be disabled). However, it won't capture navigation events in Next.js where the window doesn't reload, so we need to add some custom code to capture navigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;code&gt;pages/_app.js&lt;/code&gt; and add this code within the &lt;code&gt;MyApp&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initPostHog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../utils/initPostHog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Init for auto capturing&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initPostHog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleRouteChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$pageview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;routeChangeComplete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleRouteChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;routeChangeComplete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleRouteChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we import the &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html"&gt;React &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router"&gt;Next.js Router&lt;/a&gt; hooks. Within the &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook we initialize the PostHog JS client using the function we've just created and bind to a &lt;code&gt;routeChangeComplete&lt;/code&gt; on the Next.js router, handling the event within the &lt;code&gt;handleRouteChange&lt;/code&gt; function. When this function is called, we manually trigger a &lt;code&gt;$pageview&lt;/code&gt; event using PostHog JS with &lt;code&gt;posthog.capture('$pageview')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, restart your application so it picks up the new config in &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; and head over to the &lt;strong&gt;Events&lt;/strong&gt; section within your PostHog instance and you'll see new events appear as you test out the sign up flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3yqm9Hoz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/perctshn38slk4xume4w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3yqm9Hoz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/perctshn38slk4xume4w.png" alt="Signup funnel events in PostHog UI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how some of the events can tie in to the flow we're trying to build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Step&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Url / Screen&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1. User lands on the main website landing page&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pageview&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;locahost:3000/&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2. User clicks on one of the sign up buttons&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;clicked button with text "SignUp"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;locahost:3000/&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3. User enters their details to sign up and submits the form&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;submitted form&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;localhost:3000/auth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4. User receives registration verification email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;no event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;outside of app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5. User clicks the link in the email and successfully signs up&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;no event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;localhost:3000/auth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above table, you can see that we can track everything up until the sign up form submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is theoretically possible to track the step 4, email verification, if the email provider exposes an email sent notification mechanism via something like as a webhook. So, if Supabase offered a webhook when auth emails were sent we could track this from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we need and should be able to track step 5, when the user has successfully signed up. We know that the user lands on &lt;code&gt;/auth&lt;/code&gt; when they are logged in. If we look at the code for that page there is a &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; variable that is set if the user is logged in. So, let's update &lt;code&gt;/pages/auth.js&lt;/code&gt; so we can track a logged in user. First, include the &lt;code&gt;initPostHog&lt;/code&gt; utility:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initPostHog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../utils/initPostHog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, update the &lt;code&gt;Index&lt;/code&gt; definition:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSWR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/getUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;access_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAuthView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sign_up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initPostHog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;identify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posthog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;capture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;loggedIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code we utilize the &lt;code&gt;initPostHog&lt;/code&gt; function again to reference an initialized PostHog JS instance. We then make two function calls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;posthog.identify(user.email, user)&lt;/code&gt; - since the user is logged in we can identify them. We pass in &lt;code&gt;user.email&lt;/code&gt;, their email address, as a distinct identifier. We also pass in the Supabase &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; variable so PostHog has access to additional user data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;posthog.capture('loggedIn')&lt;/code&gt; - this triggers a simple &lt;code&gt;loggedIn&lt;/code&gt; event that we can use to identify the user as successfully having logged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you now go through the login flow, you can map all the required events in PostHog to the sign up funnel that we're building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VDtD540h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w8ygxig6r0cg7su3uyec.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VDtD540h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w8ygxig6r0cg7su3uyec.png" alt="Mapping events in PostHog to the sign up funnel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll also see the point at which &lt;code&gt;posthog.identify&lt;/code&gt; is called since the &lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt; associated with the event is now listed with each event entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: &lt;strong&gt;posthog.identify&lt;/strong&gt; is being called twice as the &lt;code&gt;Index&lt;/code&gt; function is likely being called twice during the React component life cycle as the values of state variables change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-sign-up-funnel-in-posthog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a sign up funnel in PostHog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the events for our sign up flow we can define a funnel to analyze the user journey and identify drop-off points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's recap the events in the funnel and include the new &lt;code&gt;loggedIn&lt;/code&gt; event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Step&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Url / Screen&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1. User lands on the main website landing page&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pageview&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;locahost:3000/&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2. User clicks on one of the sign up buttons&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;clicked button with text "SignUp"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;locahost:3000/&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3. User enters their details to sign up and submits the form&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;submitted form&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;localhost:3000/auth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4. User receives registration verification email&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;no event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;outside of app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5. User clicks the link in the email and successfully signs up&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;loggedIn&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;localhost:3000/auth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin defining a funnel click on the &lt;strong&gt;New Insight&lt;/strong&gt; left-hand menu item within PostHog and select the &lt;strong&gt;Funnels&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wszXcfAc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/082qb3k3mvoozu1b6s94.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wszXcfAc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/082qb3k3mvoozu1b6s94.png" alt="New Funnels Insight view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left-hand side of the view there is a panel with &lt;strong&gt;Graph Type&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Steps&lt;/strong&gt; headings. The &lt;strong&gt;Graph Type&lt;/strong&gt; value is set to &lt;strong&gt;Conversion steps&lt;/strong&gt;, which is what we want. The first of the &lt;strong&gt;Steps&lt;/strong&gt; is set to &lt;strong&gt;Pageview&lt;/strong&gt;. As we flesh out the steps, the funnel visualization will appear on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-user-lands-on-landing-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 - User lands on landing page
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step within the funnel is the user landing on the main website landing page with a path of &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. So, the event is correctly set to &lt;strong&gt;Pageview&lt;/strong&gt; but we need to filter the event by path. To do this, click the filter icon next to the step and filter on &lt;strong&gt;Path Name&lt;/strong&gt; where the path value is &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FYqJ-OjZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dz5vtd3yze7n0cabnv93.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FYqJ-OjZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dz5vtd3yze7n0cabnv93.png" alt="Step 1 - filter on landing page based on path name"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A funnel visualization won't appear at this point because a funnel must have more than one step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-user-clicks-signup-button"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 - User clicks SignUp button
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add the second step, click either of the &lt;strong&gt;Add funnel step&lt;/strong&gt; buttons. Change the event to &lt;strong&gt;Autocapture&lt;/strong&gt; since the event we're looking to make use of was one &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/integrate/client/js#autocapture"&gt;autocaptured&lt;/a&gt; by the PostHog JS SDK. Then, set a filter. When you click the filter icon this time, select the &lt;strong&gt;Elements&lt;/strong&gt; tab and select the &lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt; property. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mjHoPpDM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vlcqpkkk21seqe6daukt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mjHoPpDM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vlcqpkkk21seqe6daukt.png" alt="Step 2 - user clicks sign up button filter on element text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the filter value choose &lt;code&gt;SignUp&lt;/code&gt;, which should be pre-populated based on the values that PostHog has already ingested from our testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NlYihLW5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ab05do8p5y0log2vj6x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NlYihLW5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ab05do8p5y0log2vj6x.png" alt="Step 2 - user clicks sign up button filter on element text value"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you populate this step, you'll see the funnel visualization appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: you could also have done a &lt;strong&gt;Pageview&lt;/strong&gt; again here, filtered by a &lt;strong&gt;Path Name&lt;/strong&gt; value of &lt;code&gt;/auth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-user-submits-sign-up-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 - User submits sign up form
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this step we want to track the sign up form submission. So, create a new step with an event of &lt;strong&gt;Autocapture&lt;/strong&gt; and a first filter on the &lt;strong&gt;Event Type&lt;/strong&gt; property (not be confused with the top-level event) with a value of "submit" for the form submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uamFyG74--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ygmq59e9dix8aoo7n1zq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uamFyG74--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ygmq59e9dix8aoo7n1zq.png" alt="Step 3 - filter on Event Type of submit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the above filter will track all form submissions. This may include forms other than the sign up form. So, add a second filter specifically identifying the sign up form based. To do this, select the &lt;strong&gt;Elements&lt;/strong&gt; tab, choose &lt;strong&gt;CSS Selector&lt;/strong&gt;, and set the selector value as &lt;code&gt;[id="sign_up_form"]&lt;/code&gt; to identify the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute as having a value of &lt;code&gt;sign_up_form&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SvPlgPng--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/12klv58n2m0otpu6lp45.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SvPlgPng--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/12klv58n2m0otpu6lp45.png" alt="Step 3 - CSS Selector filter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-user-receives-registration-email"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 - User receives registration email
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the table above, we don't presently have a way of tracking this because it happens on systems outside of our control. Remember, though, it may be that an email provider could integrate with PostHog to also track email events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CgtSbtx2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/660dks8u2k2z7niy4wqa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CgtSbtx2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/660dks8u2k2z7niy4wqa.png" alt="Step 4 - Supabase sign up verification email"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-user-clicks-on-link-in-email-and-logs-into-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5 - User clicks on link in email and logs into app
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents successful completion of our sign up funnel. We added some custom code for this step earlier where a &lt;code&gt;loggedIn&lt;/code&gt; event was captured. Of course, for a user to have successfully logged in it does also mean that the sign up has been successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, add a new step to the funnel and select the &lt;code&gt;loggedIn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zqOCY8ZX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2lmjin69k6yey2xynz4u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zqOCY8ZX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2lmjin69k6yey2xynz4u.png" alt="Step 5 - user signed up and logged in"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funnel is now complete and we can see the journey of users through the sign up funnel, users that have dropped off, and users that have completed sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can adjust the options in the right-hand panel, if required. For example, you can change the orientation of the funnel visualization from left-to-right to top-to-bottom, the computation in the steps from &lt;strong&gt;Overall converstion&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Relative to previous step&lt;/strong&gt;, and the period of time the Funnel is calculated over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qM24zM1_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8by4hmu2w1euwekbej3d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qM24zM1_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8by4hmu2w1euwekbej3d.png" alt="Funnel visualization options"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can save the Funnel, giving it a name of &lt;strong&gt;Signup Funnel&lt;/strong&gt;, and add it to a Dashboard by clicking &lt;strong&gt;Save &amp;amp; add to dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--19l04uRk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3dco1swgze2to03gsqv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--19l04uRk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3dco1swgze2to03gsqv.png" alt="Save and name sign up funnel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you've learned how to create a sign up flow with Next.js and Supabase Auth. You've then ensured all the necessary application events are being ingested into PostHog. This then allows you to define the sign up flow as a sign up Funnel so you can measure the success of the user journey and identify where users drop off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where next?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of where you could explore next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-actions-instead-of-events"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Actions instead of Events
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've made extensive use of &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/user-guides/events"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt; within this tutorial. However, it can be beneficial to wrap events up into something called &lt;a href="https://posthog.comdocs/user-guides/actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/a&gt;. Actions let you group multiple events which can then be used within Insights, such as Funnels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in this tutorial we used an &lt;strong&gt;Event Type&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;CSS Selector&lt;/strong&gt; to track the sign up form submission. If we were to instead create an Action and call it &lt;strong&gt;Sign up form submitted&lt;/strong&gt; this Action could be used within the Sign up Funnel and also easily reused within other Insights. So, why not take a look at creating some reusable Actions, update the existing Funnel to use them, and try creating some other Insights?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#track-email-sending"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Track email sending
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were unable to track the email sending within this tutorial. How about exploring a way to add capture a &lt;code&gt;signUpEmailSent&lt;/code&gt; event within PostHog when the verification email is sent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of options here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supabase uses a tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/supabase/gotrue"&gt;GoTrue&lt;/a&gt; which does support webhook configuration for email events such as &lt;code&gt;validate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;signup&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt;. Why not get involved in the Supabase community and see if these events can be exposed via Supabase?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;strong&gt;Enable Custom SMTP&lt;/strong&gt; within Supabase and use a third-party email provider that exposes webhooks for email events?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry if you are completely new to data science, Data Science is the mix of data interference, various analytical tools, different programming algorithms, and machine learning principles where data is used to gain valuable insights on &lt;a rel="dofollow" href="https://www.businesstomark.com/"&gt;great seo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this digital era, it would be silly to ignore data and the benefits it brings to an organization. Many businesses have shifted to data-driven approach in different ways. And those who haven’t shifted yet are likely to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three consecutive years, data scientist is topping the number one job chart in the U.S. by Glassdoor. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, by 2026,   the evolution of data science will create 11.5 million job opportunities in the country. The role of data scientist has become such a hot job option for tech geeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Create An Image Background In WordPress</title>
      <author>CodeWatchers</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:01:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codewatchers_en/how-to-create-an-image-background-in-wordpress-h39</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codewatchers_en/how-to-create-an-image-background-in-wordpress-h39</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding an image to your WordPress background not only makes it much more engaging but also pleasing to the users and will enhance their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a WordPress background image with a few simple steps. In this tutorial, we are going to look at two methods of adding an image to WordPress background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-create-an-image-background-with-wordpress-theme" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How To Create An Image Background With WordPress Theme
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily create an image background on WordPress if your theme allows you to create a custom background while most of the WordPress themes do support custom backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your theme supports custom background, you can follow these simple steps to create an image background on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt; panel and then &lt;strong&gt;Customize&lt;/strong&gt; page on your WordPress. From there, you will be able to change theme settings for a custom background by going to the &lt;strong&gt;Background Image&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PNVlu9TT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://codewatchers.com/secure/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Select-Image.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PNVlu9TT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://codewatchers.com/secure/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Select-Image.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then, you need to select the background image option where it will show you option to add your image for the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3iBQGnmt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://codewatchers.com/secure/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-Selection.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3iBQGnmt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://codewatchers.com/secure/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-Selection.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Next, you can upload the picture for the background or select one from your WordPress media library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Charts Dashboard: a Tutorial with an Artistic Touch of MoMA 🖼</title>
      <author>Igor Lukanin</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/cubejs/google-charts-dashboard-a-tutorial-with-an-artistic-touch-of-moma-1jdn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll learn how to visualize data with Google Charts, a free charting service and JavaScript library by Google. We'll also use Cube, an open-source API for building data apps, to provide access to the public dataset with The Museum of Modern Art collection data. In the end, we'll have a dashboard with charts that tell all about MoMA's contemporary artworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how the end result will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bTVeR7fu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/8e89685a-2862-4647-adbe-dd50727ff364.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bTVeR7fu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/8e89685a-2862-4647-adbe-dd50727ff364.png" alt="Demo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to try it? Here's the &lt;a href="https://google-charts-dashboard-demo.cube.dev"&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt; you can use right away.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, the full &lt;a href="https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/tree/master/examples/google-charts-moma"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we're all set. Please check your ticket and proceed to Floor 1, Charting Gallery 🎫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-google-charts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Google Charts?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Charts is a charting service by Google that provides a rich selection of data visualization types, renders charts using HTML5 and SVG, provides cross-browser compatibility and cross-platform portability (meaning that charts look nice both on desktop and mobile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k5M45tfs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e2567875-f039-4230-b414-ac974ac395b1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k5M45tfs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e2567875-f039-4230-b414-ac974ac395b1.png" alt="Google Charts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it a &lt;em&gt;charting service&lt;/em&gt;, not a &lt;em&gt;charting library&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed, Google Charts provide a JavaScript library that takes the data and renders charts on the web page. However, unlike other data visualization tools, Google Charts don't render all the charts on the client side. Instead, for some of the charts, they pass the data to Google servers, render a chart there, and then display the result on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an approach has its pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rendering code is browser- and platform-independent which provides increased compatibility and portability. If it renders once, it will render anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The size of the JavaScript library is fixed and doesn't depend on the features used. And it's actually really tiny — less than 20 KB (gzipped).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also has its cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some charts, data has to be uploaded to Google servers for the chart to be rendered. If you deal with sensitive data, please check the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/terms"&gt;Google APIs Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Also, make sure to always check the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/scatterchart#data-policy"&gt;Data Policy&lt;/a&gt; sections in the docs. In this tutorial, we'll be using a public dataset, so it's not a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which charts are available?&lt;/strong&gt; Among the usual suspects like line charts, bar charts, or pie charts you can find a few distinctive ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Calendar charts&lt;/em&gt; that you must have seen numerous times at GitHub profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gantt charts&lt;/em&gt; that you might have wished to never encounter because of their affinity to "enterprise software".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Diff charts&lt;/em&gt; that combine a couple of scatter charts, pie charts, or bar charts into an image that visualizes the difference between two similar datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Vega charts&lt;/em&gt; that provide a way to render charts defined with &lt;a href="https://awesome.cube.dev/tools/vega?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;Vega&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://awesome.cube.dev/tools/vega-lite?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;Vega-Lite&lt;/a&gt; visual grammars in Google Charts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VtxFjJ7g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/119c5b45-fca1-4e2f-a592-1ba251b4e3f6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VtxFjJ7g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/119c5b45-fca1-4e2f-a592-1ba251b4e3f6.png" alt="Chart types"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying the sight so far? Please proceed to Floor 2, Modern Arts 🎫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-moma"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is MoMA?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museum of Modern Art is an art museum in New York, USA. It was established 91 years ago, on November 7, 1929, and it's often identified as one of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_art_museums"&gt;l&lt;/a&gt;argest and most influential museums of modern art in the world. MoMA's collection includes almost 200,000 works of architecture and design, drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, prints, illustrated books, film, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_media"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;lectronic media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On GitHub, MoMA publishes and periodically updates a &lt;a href="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection"&gt;public dataset&lt;/a&gt; which contains ~140,000 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each work (e.g., title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date of acquisition). This dataset is placed in the public domain using a CC0 License (so we're free to use it in this tutorial) and available in CSV and JSON formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nMmfzFVA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/c08f5a0c-4940-4ad8-b4e1-1b5506c1985c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nMmfzFVA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/c08f5a0c-4940-4ad8-b4e1-1b5506c1985c.png" alt="MoMA dataset"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've imported this dataset to a publicly available Postgres instance that we'll use in a few minutes to explore the data. Proceed to Floor 3, Cubism 🎫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-cube"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Cube?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're building a dashboard, so it would be very convenient to access the data from the front end via an API. Cube comes particularly handy for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cube.dev?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt; is a popular open-source product with more than 11,000 stars on GitHub to date. It serves as an API for building data apps. You can configure Cube to connect to any database, describe your data with a declarative data schema, and instantly get an API that you can use in your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's spin up an API for the MoMA dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; First, please make sure you have &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; installed on your machine. It's &lt;a href="https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/docker?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; to run Cube with Docker or use a managed instance in &lt;a href="https://cube.dev/cloud?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;Cube Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, let's create a new folder for your Cube app and navigate to it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;google-charts-moma
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;google-charts-moma
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third, run this snippet to create a new &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file with the configuration. We'll also use environment variables from the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file to instruct Cube how to connect to Postgres:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; docker-compose.yml &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;EOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
version: '2.2'
services:
  cube:
    image: cubejs/cube:latest
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
      - 3000:3000
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/cube/conf
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOL
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, run this snippet to create the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file with Postgres credentials. In this tutorial, we're using a publicly available Postgres database that I've already set up. Check the &lt;a href="https://cube.dev/docs/config/databases/postgres?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about connecting Cube to Postgres or any other database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; .env &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;EOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
CUBEJS_DB_TYPE=postgres
CUBEJS_DB_HOST=demo-db-examples.cube.dev
CUBEJS_DB_NAME=moma
CUBEJS_DB_USER=cube
CUBEJS_DB_PASS=12345
CUBEJS_API_SECRET=SECRET
CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;EOL
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is all we need to let Cube connect to Postgres. The last part of configuration is the &lt;a href="https://cube.dev/docs/schema/getting-started?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;data schema&lt;/a&gt; which declaratively describes the contents of the database. Let's put it under the &lt;code&gt;schema&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;schema
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;Artworks.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please copy and paste this data schema into &lt;code&gt;Artworks.js&lt;/code&gt;, then follow the comments in the file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Artworks`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Cube definition.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It says that the data is kept in the "artworks" table.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Learn more in the docs: https://cube.dev/docs/schema/getting-started&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`SELECT * FROM public.artworks`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Quantitative information about the data, e.g., count of rows.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It makes sense for all rows rather than individual rows&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`count`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;minAgeAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`MIN(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ageAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;avgAgeAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`SUM(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ageAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;) / &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxAgeAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`MAX(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ageAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Qualitative information about the data, e.g., an artwork's title.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It makes sense for individual rows of data rather than all rows&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dimensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."Title"`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`string`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."Artist"`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`string`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;classification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."Classification"`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`string`&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."Medium"`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`string`&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."DateAcquired"`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ageAtAcquisition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yearAcquired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;::INT - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;::INT`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`0`&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;heightCm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`ROUND(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."Height (cm)")`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;widthCm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`ROUND(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."Width (cm)")`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`number`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`default`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whew! Now we're finally ready to run Cube:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, let's review the data in the MoMA dataset.&lt;/strong&gt; Cube provides the &lt;a href="https://cube.dev/docs/dev-tools/dev-playground?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;Developer Playground&lt;/a&gt;, a convenient web-based tool that helps explore the data, at &lt;a href="http://localhost:4000/"&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;. Navigate to the Developer Playground in your browser and explore the UI. You can retrieve arbitrary data, slice and dice the dataset by selecting dimensions and measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can check how many artworks MoMA has for the artists that have "Sarah" in their name. To do so, select the &lt;code&gt;Artworks.count&lt;/code&gt; measure, the &lt;code&gt;Artworks.artist&lt;/code&gt; dimension, and also make sure to add a filter for the &lt;code&gt;Artworks.artist&lt;/code&gt; dimension that allows only the names containing "Sarah".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hddGhcd8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/6408ed85-9b19-4895-a039-0b838773ef26.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hddGhcd8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/6408ed85-9b19-4895-a039-0b838773ef26.png" alt="Developer Playground"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to tinker with other measures and dimensions. Once you're done, let's get to building the dashboard. Proceed to Floor 4, Abstract Art 🎫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-dashboard-with-google-charts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a dashboard with Google Charts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to develop a front-end application telling the story behind the MoMA artworks collection with charts and other types of data visualizations. For simplicity, let's build it with pure JavaScript and without any frameworks (however, unofficial packages are available on NPM for &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-charts"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-google-charts"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-google-charts"&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt; as well as TypeScript definitions in the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/google.visualization"&gt;DefinitelyTyped&lt;/a&gt; repository).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic dashboard.&lt;/strong&gt; First, let's create a subfolder for the dashboard under the &lt;code&gt;google-charts-moma&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;dashboard-app
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;dashboard-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, let's start with an HTML file with the following contents. You can name it &lt;code&gt;basic.html&lt;/code&gt; and put in that &lt;code&gt;dashboard-app&lt;/code&gt; folder. We'll go through this file line by line. Follow the comments!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Load Cube API library (UMD version for in-browser use) --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/javascript"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://unpkg.com/@cubejs-client/core@0.28.38/dist/cubejs-client-core.umd.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Load Google Charts API --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/javascript"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/javascript"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Cube API token and host.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Change to "http://localhost:4000" to use your own Cube.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the docs to learn more about authentication: https://cube.dev/docs/security&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cubeToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjEwMDAwMDAwMDAsImV4cCI6NTAwMDAwMDAwMH0.OHZOpOBVKr-sCwn8sbZ5UFsqI3uCs6e4omT7P6WVMFw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cubeHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://heavy-lansford.gcp-us-central1.cubecloudapp.dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Instantiate Cube API client&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cubeApi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cubejs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cubeToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;apiUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cubeHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/cubejs-api/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Load Google Charts API and packages ('corechart' is the main one)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;corechart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;]});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Set a callback to run when the Google Visualization API is loaded&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;charts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setOnLoadCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawCharts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Function that creates the charts.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We'll start with just a couple of them&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawCharts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="na"&gt;pointSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;legend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;visualization&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ScatterChart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;chart__years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Google Charts Dashboard&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.dashboard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-column-gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-column-gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dashboard"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Charts within the dashboard --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"group"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"chart__artists"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"chart__years"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's what you should get once you save the contents of this file and open it in the browser. It's a table and a fancy diagonal chart — because it's unlikely that MoMA can acquire an artwork before it was created, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--27uZ_KD9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/69a2c838-ee29-477c-a2e7-865f63cc6093.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--27uZ_KD9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/69a2c838-ee29-477c-a2e7-865f63cc6093.png" alt="Demo, first preview"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 200 lines of code allowed us to include all libraries, query an API, transform the data, configure charts, and render them side-by-side on the page. Not that bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I wouldn't call it a full-fledged dashboard until it allows interaction with elements and change how the data is represented. Let's explore how to work with events and cross-link the charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive dashboard.&lt;/strong&gt; Please create another file, you can call it &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. It will contain 2-3 more lines of code, so we'll have more charts and some bits of code that allow working with events. Copy and paste the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js/tree/master/examples/google-charts-moma"&gt;code from GitHub&lt;/a&gt; — and let's go through the most interesting parts together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have many charts and many functions to draw them:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawCharts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkArtists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkMediums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkYears&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkWidthsHeights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkAcquisitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkAcquisitionsIn1964&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkAcquisitionsAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the charts, the table with artists' names, has got an event listener that is fired every time you select one or many table rows or clear the selection. As you can see, we somehow build the filter for the data using the &lt;code&gt;buildQueryFilter&lt;/code&gt; function and then pass this filter to every other chart:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;visualization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buildQueryFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Artworks.artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkMediums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkYears&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkWidthsHeights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkAcquisitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkAcquisitionsIn1964&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;drawChartForArtworkAcquisitionsAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;artistsFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's how we build the filter. We access selected rows via &lt;code&gt;chart.getSelection()&lt;/code&gt;. If there are no rows selected, the filter will be undefined. If there are any, we'll find the values of selected cells and use them as values in the Cube query filter:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;buildQueryFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedRowNumbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSelection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedRowNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultSet&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tablePivot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedRowNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;equals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's all you need to add interactivity to the dashboard. See how the charts change upon the selection of one or many artists in the first table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9bVPYjWu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/f7729016-4b7d-4c2f-ac2e-4f7b3f2e4c9d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9bVPYjWu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cubedev-blog-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/f7729016-4b7d-4c2f-ac2e-4f7b3f2e4c9d.png" alt="Demo, second preview"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a kind of art, isn't it? 🧑‍🎨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, these charts and this whole tutorial are inspired by the work of others that I'd like to mention here: "&lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-nerds-guide-to-the-2229-paintings-at-moma/"&gt;A Nerd’s Guide To The 2,229 Paintings At MoMA&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://research.kraeutli.com/index.php/2015/09/moma-on-github/"&gt;MoMA on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;em&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/em&gt;, and this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lubar/status/626349654830092289"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Steven Lubar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and following this tutorial! I encourage you to spend some time &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs"&gt;in the docs&lt;/a&gt; and explore what else Google Charts are capable of. You'll find even more chart types, configuration options, and advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, thanks for learning about &lt;a href="https://cube.dev?utm_source=dev-to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google-charts-dashboard"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt; and building dashboards. I hope you enjoyed it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don't hesitate to like and bookmark this post, write a comment, and give a star to &lt;a href="https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. I hope that you'll try Cube and Google Charts in your next production gig or your next pet project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun! Now, proceed to the exit! 🎫&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ELI5 JavaScript: The Spread Operator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful features introduced in ES6 is the Spread Operator. It is denoted by three dots (...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to MDN Web Docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds complex right?&lt;br&gt;
Don't worry, read this article till the end, and I will make sure you know the ins and outs of the Spread Operator :)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/5zf2M4HgjjWszLd4a5/giphy.gif" alt="Let's Begin Gif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, the spread operator is used to 'spread' out the elements of an iterable (string, array, etc.). Let's look at an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//with spread operator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay! Now let's look at some use cases of the spread operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Table of Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#passing-arguments"&gt;Passing arguments to functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#copying-arrays-objects"&gt;Copying arrays/objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.1 &lt;a href="#copying-arrays"&gt;Arrays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2.2 &lt;a href="#copying-objects"&gt;Objects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#combining-arrays-objects"&gt;Combining arrays/objects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.1 &lt;a href="#combining-arrays"&gt;Arrays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3.2 &lt;a href="#combining-objects"&gt;Objects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#string-to-characters"&gt;String to characters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="passing-arguments"&gt;1. Passing arguments to functions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of passing each element separately, you can use the spread operator!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 id="copying-arrays-objects"&gt;2. Copying arrays/objects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the spread operator to create copies of arrays &amp;amp; objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="copying-arrays"&gt;2.1 Arrays&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;arr1 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;arr2 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;arr3 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Can you guess the output?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//output &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;arr1 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;arr2 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;arr3 = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's understand what happened...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assignment operator (=) creates a reference to the original array. So here,
arr2 is just a reference to arr1. Both arr1 and arr2 point to the same array in memory!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make a copy, we use the spread operator! By using the spread operator we make a new copy of the array in the memory. Now changes made to arr1 will not be reflected in arr3 (and vice-versa)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id="copying-objects"&gt;2.2 Objects&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nisarg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Kapkar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hashnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nnkkaapp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj1&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar to arrays, changing obj1 changes obj2 but not obj3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;br&gt;
While copying arrays/objects, the spread operator only goes one level deep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, both num1 and num2 will be equal to [[100, 2], [3, 4], [5,6]]. &lt;br&gt;
A similar thing happens when you copy nested objects using the spread operator.&lt;br&gt;
The nested arrays/objects inside an array/object are just references. So when you use the spread operator to copy, the nested arrays/objects are not copied (rather their references are copied)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="combining-arrays-objects"&gt;3. Combining arrays/objects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the spread operator to combine arrays &amp;amp; objects (and insert elements in arrays &amp;amp; objects)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="combining-arrays"&gt;3.1 Arrays&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;arr3 will contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8 (arr1 elements+7+arr2 elements+8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="combining-objects"&gt;3.2 Objects&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nisarg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Kapkar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hashnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nnkkaapp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;23/12/2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nisarg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Kapkar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nnkkaapp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;23/12/2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;br&gt;
If there are multiple values for the same key (in the above example: 'website'), the last encountered value is assigned, and all the previous values are overwritten (in the above example, 'Hashnode' is overwritten by 'Medium')&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="string-to-characters"&gt;4. String to characters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Nisarg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since a string is iterable, we can use the spread operator on it. The output of above code will be ["N", "i", "s", "a", "r", "g"]&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Woooo! Thank you for reading 😄&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Symfony is used to speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications and to replace repetition of coding tasks. Symfony is a reusable set of standalone, decoupled and cohesive PHP components that solve common web development problems. &lt;br&gt;
Symfony is very easy to install and use for php developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantage-of-using-symfony"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantage of  using Symfony
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time-saving capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code reusable and easier to maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error logging
4.Easy to Use
## Symfony  installation
&amp;gt;Before you can install Symfony you must have the following requirement:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web server e.g XAMPP, WAMP, or any other server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility: PHP 5.4 or later version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composer (we’ll use a composer for all our installation or else state otherwise)
##Installation using Composer
For you to install Symfony using composer installation, you must have composer installed on your device.
The command below is used to create a Symfony project using the composer.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton application_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-symfony-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running Symfony Application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symfony provides a local web server for running Symfony applications. to run your application move to your project folder.&lt;br&gt;
The following command is used to create a local web server and for running your application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd HelloWorld 
php bin/console server:run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now Open your browser and request the URL  &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/"&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/a&gt;. you’ll see a welcome page if your Symfony installation is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have finished testing your application, you need to press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+C&lt;/code&gt; from your terminal to stop the local web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.T local web server works with other PHP applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-start-with-symfony"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting start with Symfony
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Creating the first HTML page&lt;br&gt;
Creating an HTML page is base on a two-step process namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a route: In &lt;code&gt;config/routes.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, the route defines the URL to your&lt;br&gt;
page (path) and what controller to call. The route is the URL  to the page you want to create(e.g. &lt;code&gt;/contact&lt;/code&gt;) and points to a controller;&lt;br&gt;
Create a controller: the controller is the PHP function you write that makes up the page. A controller can be used to process HTTP requests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let print Hello world, this is my first page on your HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a page &lt;code&gt;welcome/page&lt;/code&gt; that will print out  Hello world this is my first page &lt;br&gt;
 First and foremost we have to create a controller class and a controller method inside it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;first_page&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Hello world, this is my first page&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can now  associate the public URL (e.g. &lt;code&gt;/contact&lt;/code&gt;) with the controller &lt;code&gt;function hello()&lt;/code&gt; that we created above under the &lt;code&gt;config/routes.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
Open &lt;code&gt;config/routes.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file and edit it as shown below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt; # config/routes.yaml

# the "first_website" route name is not important yet
first_website:
    path: /contact
    controller: App\Controller\first_page::hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Save your project and start your server then go to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8000/contact&lt;/code&gt; on your browser. You should see Hello world, this is my first page on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#twig-rendering-a-template"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Twig - Rendering a Template
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it looks as odds to render a full static HTML code in the controller directly, we can use Twig to render HTML responses from a template. Symfony comes with Twig: a templating language that’s minimal, powerful templating language and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twig package installation&lt;br&gt;
  Let install the twig package using the following command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;   composer require twig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using Twig  for application&lt;br&gt;
Make sure that first_page extends Symfony’s base&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/Controller/LuckyController.php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;frist_page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AbstractController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * @Route("/contact")
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$greetings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'static_template.html.twig'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$greetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; method is used to render the template, pass in the variable that you want to use( in our project we’re using greetings) so that we can use it in twig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Template files are store in the &lt;code&gt;templates/&lt;/code&gt; directory, which was created for you automatically when you installed Twig. Create a new templates/contact directory with a new &lt;code&gt;contact.html.twig&lt;/code&gt; file inside:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{# templates/lucky/number.html.twig #}
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{{ greetings}}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;{{ greetings}}&lt;/code&gt; syntax is used to print variables passed from the controller,  in Twig. Refresh your browser you’ll Hello world, this is my first page on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symfony form&lt;br&gt;
Symfony provides a package called  Symfony Flex for handling HTML form processing. Which makes it easy for validating submitted data, mapping the form data into objects, and a lot more.&lt;br&gt;
  Symfony flex installation&lt;br&gt;
Run the following command to install the package:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    composer require symfony/form
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creating forms in the controller&lt;br&gt;
open &lt;code&gt;Form/Type/TaskType.php&lt;/code&gt;  from your editor. For you to add input fields along with their attributes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/Form/Type/TaskType.php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Form\Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\DateType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\SubmitType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\TextType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TaskType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AbstractType&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;buildForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;FormBuilderInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$builder&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'task'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TextType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'dueDate'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;DateType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'save'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SubmitType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the above code, $build is used to add input or field to a form along with its attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$builder-&amp;gt;add(name,textType::class)&lt;/code&gt; : name represent the name of the input field and textType represent the format of the input to accept e.g text, date, email, e.t.c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rendering Forms&lt;br&gt;
Now we have created the form, let display the form in the browser.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/Controller/TaskController.php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Entity\Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Form\Type\TaskType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TaskController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AbstractController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TaskType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;renderForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'task/new.html.twig'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'form'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now go to your tamplate file and render the form as show below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{# templates/task/new.html.twig #}
{{ form(form) }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;form()&lt;/code&gt; function is a form helper function. it renders all fields and the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; start and end tags. By default, the form method is &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; and the target URL is the same that displayed the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing form&lt;br&gt;
Processing form mean to get submitted form data at the backend and manipulating the data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/Controller/TaskController.php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TaskController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AbstractController&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// just setup a fresh $task object (remove the example data)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TaskType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;handleRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;isSubmitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;isValid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// $form-&amp;gt;getData() holds the submitted values&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// but, the original `$task` variable has also been updated&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... perform some action, such as saving the task to the database&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// for example, if Task is a Doctrine entity, save it!&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// $entityManager = $this-&amp;gt;getDoctrine()-&amp;gt;getManager();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// $entityManager-&amp;gt;persist($task);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// $entityManager-&amp;gt;flush();&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;redirectToRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'task_success'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;renderForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'task/new.html.twig'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'form'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JS1 course ended by a little examination project, namely building a web store, by fetching a API, rendering items on the page. Then added some functionality as calculate the total sum and add items to the basket. The most challenging for me is the filtering items function. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Android — Instrumentation test with hilt</title>
      <author>Mahendran</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mahendranv/android-instrumentation-test-with-hilt-2ep6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mahendranv/android-instrumentation-test-with-hilt-2ep6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing in Android has been a pain from the beginning and there is no standard architecture setup to execute the frictionless test. As you know there is no silver bullet for all the snags. This piece of article covers how do you fake dependencies to your hilt-viewmodel and assert the same from fragment using espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we achieve here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decoupled UI from navigation and real data source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed fake data to our viewmodel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less flaky test since we control the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-or- Explained in a single picture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100% code coverage is a myth and the more you squeeze towards it, you end up with flaky tests. Provided the content is dynamic and involves latency due to API calls, it is simply hard to achieve. So, to what degree we should write tests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u3mpCz2b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1%2A6M7_pT_2HJR-o-AXgkHU0g.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u3mpCz2b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1%2A6M7_pT_2HJR-o-AXgkHU0g.jpeg" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unit tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Small &amp;amp; fast. Even with a large number of tests, there won't be much impact on execution time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Integration tests&lt;/strong&gt;: Covers how a system integrates with others. ex. How viewmodel works with the data source. Cover the touchpoints. Runs on JVM – reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;UI tests&lt;/strong&gt;: Tests that cover UI interactions. In android, this means launching an emulator and running tests in it. Slow! dead slow!! So, write tests to assert fixed UI states. &lt;a href="#wrapup"&gt;Wrapup&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the article should give a rough idea of execution time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we cover how to write the integration and UI tests using hilt. Before the actual implementation, take a minute to read on &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html"&gt;test double&lt;/a&gt;s (literally a very short article!). We'll be using Fakes in our tests. Keep in mind while coding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hilt resolves a dependency by its type.&lt;/strong&gt; So, our code should refer to the *Fake*able dependency as interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Provide your dependency in module&lt;/strong&gt;. So that the whole module can be faked along with dependencies. More on this is covered in &lt;a href="#faking-modules"&gt;faking modules&lt;/a&gt; section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dependency-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dependency overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap from &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mahendranv/android-basic-hilt-setup-with-viewmodel-fragment-32fd"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we have a fragment that requires a Profile (POJO) object which is provided through a ViewModel. &lt;code&gt;DataRepository&lt;/code&gt; acts as a source of truth here and returns a profile. &lt;code&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt; is unaware of the implementation of &lt;code&gt;DataRepository&lt;/code&gt; and Hilt resolves it at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JqpZ1rhz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6584143/138072585-ec3fc907-88d7-40cd-bf2b-2d6cb0a28a98.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JqpZ1rhz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6584143/138072585-ec3fc907-88d7-40cd-bf2b-2d6cb0a28a98.png" alt="dependency overview"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the existing implementation, we'll bring in our Fake data source &lt;code&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/code&gt; for tests. So, the rest of the post is about instructing Hilt to use &lt;code&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;DataRepositoryImpl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#test-runner-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Test runner setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add test dependencies to app level gradle file. This brings a &lt;code&gt;HiltTestApplication&lt;/code&gt; and annotation processor to the project now. As we've seen in the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mahendranv/android-basic-hilt-setup-with-viewmodel-fragment-32fd#little-about-scope"&gt;scope section&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HiltTestApplication&lt;/code&gt; will hold singleton component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight groovy"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/build.gradle&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hilt - testing&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;androidTestImplementation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'com.google.dagger:hilt-android-testing:2.38.1'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;kaptAndroidTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'com.google.dagger:hilt-android-compiler:2.38.1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;code&gt;HiltTestApplication&lt;/code&gt; is present in our app, it is not used in tests yet. This hookup is done by defining a &lt;code&gt;CustomTestRunner&lt;/code&gt;. It points to the test application when instantiating the application class for instrument tests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/src/androidTest/java/com/ex2/hiltespresso/CustomTestRunner.kt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dagger.hilt.android.testing.HiltTestApplication&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CustomTestRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;AndroidJUnitRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;newApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;cl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ClassLoader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;newApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HiltTestApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the final step is to declare the test runner in app/gradle file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight groovy"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/build.gradle&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;android&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaultConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//  testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;testInstrumentationRunner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"com.ex2.hiltespresso.CustomTestRunner"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shared-test-fakes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Shared test fakes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In android, there are Unit and Instrumentation tests. Although both identify as tests, they cannot share resources between them. Here, few places where tests will lookup for classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; source set - here we place the production code. Fakes have no place here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;testShared&lt;/code&gt; source set - This is the recommended way to share resources. Create the below directory structure and place the &lt;code&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/code&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QzEt5cJE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6584143/138258099-2215cf0f-ed2a-4269-9981-0f9e2b03c4a8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QzEt5cJE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6584143/138258099-2215cf0f-ed2a-4269-9981-0f9e2b03c4a8.png" alt="shared-test"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/src/testShared/java/com/ex2/hiltespresso/data/FakeDataRepoImpl.kt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Inject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;DataRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Fake Name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to add this to &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;androidTest&lt;/code&gt; source sets. In app level gradle file, include &lt;code&gt;testShared&lt;/code&gt; source set to test sources.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight groovy"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/build.gradle&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;android&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;sourceSets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;srcDirs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"$projectDir/src/testShared"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;androidTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;srcDirs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"$projectDir/src/testShared"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-integration-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing integration test
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the integration test, we'll verify data source and viewmodel coupling is proper. As seen in the testing strategy section,  tests run faster if the emulator is not involved. Here, &lt;em&gt;ViewModel&lt;/em&gt; can be tested without UI. All it needs is the &lt;code&gt;DataRepository&lt;/code&gt;. In the last section, we placed the &lt;code&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/code&gt; in the shared source set. Let's manually inject it and assert the data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/src/test/java/com/ex2/hiltespresso/ui/profile/ProfileViewModelTest.kt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RunWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;JUnit4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProfileViewModelTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;lateinit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;SUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Before&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;`Profile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fetched&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;repository`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nf"&gt;assertThat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name consumed from data source"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;getProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;`is`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Fake Name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Why ProfileViewModel is instantiated manually instead of using Hilt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the piece of HiltViewModelFactory which instantiates &lt;code&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;SavedStateRegistryOwner&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;defaultArgs&lt;/code&gt; are coming from Activity/Fragment that is marked with &lt;code&gt;@AndroidEntryPoint&lt;/code&gt;. So, instantiating the viewmodel with hilt also brings in the complexity of launching the activity and testing the viewmodel from there. This will result in a slower test whereas viewmodel test can run on JVM like we did above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HiltViewModelFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NonNull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SavedStateRegistryOwner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Nullable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Bundle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;defaultArgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NonNull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hiltViewModelKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NonNull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewModelProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Factory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;delegateFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NonNull&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewModelComponentBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewModelComponentBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#instrumentation-or-ui-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Instrumentation or UI tests
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instrumentation/UI tests run on emulator. For this project we'll assert whether the name in UI matches the one in (fake) data source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a real-world application, the data source is dynamic and mostly involves a web service. This means UI tests tend to get flaky. So, the ideal approach is to bring down the UI to have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine"&gt;finite-states&lt;/a&gt; and map it to the ViewModel and fake it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Example UI states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI when the network response has failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI when there are N items in the list vs the empty state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin &lt;a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/sealed-classes.html"&gt;sealed classes&lt;/a&gt; are a good fit to design an FSM. The aforementioned use-cases are not covered here!! (and won't fall into a straight line to write an article). So, here is the blueprint on how do we inject our fake for ViewModel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#faking-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Faking modules
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instrument tests (androidTest), hilt is responsible for instantiating the ViewModel. So, we need someone who speaks Hilt's language. Create a fake module that will provide our &lt;code&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/code&gt; to the viewmodel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/src/androidTest/java/com/ex2/hiltespresso/di/FakeProfileModule.kt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dagger.hilt.android.components.ViewModelComponent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dagger.hilt.testing.TestInstallIn&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hey Hilt!! Forget about the ProfileModule - use me instead&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@TestInstallIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewModelComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;replaces&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProfileModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Module&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeProfileModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Provides&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getProfileSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;DataRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FakeDataRepoImpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice the &lt;code&gt;TestInstallIn&lt;/code&gt; annotation. Defining the replaces array will make the original &lt;code&gt;ProfileModule&lt;/code&gt; replaced with &lt;code&gt;FakeProfileModule&lt;/code&gt;. While building the component, hilt will replace the original module (and thus dependencies) and instantiate the ViewModel with the fake repo. Our UI will use the viewmodel and tests will assert the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-hiltandroidtest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The HiltAndroidTest
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final piece is to write a test that uses the faked component. All it needs is a couple of test rules and annotation from Hilt. Rest is generated!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight kotlin"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// File: app/src/androidTest/java/com/ex2/hiltespresso/MainActivityHiltTest.kt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RunWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AndroidJUnit4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@HiltAndroidTest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MainActivityHiltTest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;hiltRule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HiltAndroidRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;activityRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ActivityScenarioRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MainActivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ActivityScenarioRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MainActivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_name_matches_data_source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Inject the dependencies to the test (if there is any @Inject field in the test)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;hiltRule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Espresso&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;onView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewMatchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;withId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name_label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewAssertions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Matchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;allOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewMatchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;isDisplayed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ViewMatchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;withText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Fake Name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rules are executed first before running the test. It ensures the activity has dependencies resolved before test execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;HiltAndroidRule&lt;/code&gt; (order = 0) : First create components (singleton, activity, fragment, viewmodel) and obey the &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; contract mentioned in previous step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ActivityScenarioRule&lt;/code&gt; (order = 1): Launch the activity mentioned before each test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The espresso &amp;amp; hamcrest matchers are descriptive. In the view tree, it lookup for a view and assert whether it's visible and carries the text defined in fake data repo.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article gave a blueprint for organizing the code in order to achieve component links in isolation. Apart from the hilt-related setup, this practice could benefit even the code that was built with manual injection. Just follow these key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always define the data source as interface. So that it can be faked/mocked for tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make &lt;code&gt;fragment / activity&lt;/code&gt;'s UI controlled by the viewmodel. You don't have to fake the link here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A viewmodel should emit finite states to the UI at any point of time. This state may be dictated by the data source or a reaction to user input in UI (eg. enabling a button based on content length)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you wonder about the execution time, here it is: 5ms vs 3.5 sec&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NodeJS - Socket.io questions</title>
      <author>Little Boss</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 16:11:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/littleboss/nodejs-socketio-questions-3gjd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/littleboss/nodejs-socketio-questions-3gjd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently building a project in nodejs with an angular application as a frontend. I need to send data from my website to the server (POST reqeust) which then emtis data to one of many raspberry PIs and gives feedback to my angular app per websocket connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few questions on how to do this whole process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an index.js file where I load all my express middleware etc, and some router files for specific routes. The websocket connection should be initialised outside the router so I dont open a new one every time. Should I create an on connection listener in the index.js file and outsource all the emits to a different file&lt;a href="https://community.tp-link.com/en/home/forum/topic/504216"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; or should the whole socket server live inside a different file?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that socketio needs an http server to work, but I cannot pass an exress server in its constructor. Should I use an http server for my server instead and use express as a request handler? Or should I create a new http server for my websocket connection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I create a different socket server for the server/angular and raspberry/server communication (I will need to store the socketID and token/id of the raspberry in a map to know which raspberry I should send the data to) or should I use the same server with different rooms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologise if those questions are too basic&lt;a href="https://www.seoclerk.com/Link-Building/1050398/Meet-Dubai-Call-Girls-0529501107-Call-Girls-Dubai-Agency"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; I have never really worked with websockets so I dont know about the best practices when working with them. I want to do everything as clean as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging Tutorial 1 – Introduction: Conditional Breakpoints</title>
      <author>Shai Almog</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:59:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codenameone/debugging-tutorial-1-introduction-conditional-breakpoints-3ni3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codenameone/debugging-tutorial-1-introduction-conditional-breakpoints-3ni3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First post in a (hopefully) long series covering everything you need to know about debugging in VSCode, IntelliJ/IDEA in Java, NodeJS, Kotlin &amp;amp; Python.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series I’ll walk you through the process of debugging applications and finding issues within them. As we debug we’ll cover the techniques important for most developers. I will cover the following debuggers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IntelliJ/IDEA – with Java/Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCharm – Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VSCode – for JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WebStorm – for JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These should cover most use cases you’ll run into and some things will seem duplicate/redundant so you can just skip to the applicable section if you feel you “got the gist”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that while I won’t cover TypeScript, everything discussed in the JavaScript tutorial is applicable to TypeScript too. The same applies to most JVM languages like Scala etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally people separate these tutorials based on IDE/Language. I think having all of them together is beneficial in providing the “big picture”. We also move through languages/IDEs in our career and having a wider viewpoint is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a future post I’d also like to also talk about browser debugging with Chrome DevTools and Firefox Web Developer Tools. However, these are a slightly different process so I’ll leave them out for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also included a video tutorial highlighting the steps visually. This might help if my instructions are unclear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lopSiJAaRUQ"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#motivation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Motivation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal in this series is to bring you up to speed so we can dig into the real interesting tutorials near the end. The first part might seem a bit trivial since I’m assuming zero knowledge of debugging techniques but I plan to get in-depth with these posts as we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you might be asking yourself, why even go through this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need to go through a debugging tutorial? I already know programming and using a debugger isn’t exactly rocket science…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well… We spend 50% of our time chasing bugs according to this  &lt;a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.370.9611&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; , although I saw numbers ranging from 25% to 75%. Unfortunately, this is a skill that Universities don’t really teach. Even at our jobs people gloss over this essential skill. There are books that cover this subject but a lot are out of date and aim at more complex scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging isn’t just about finding bugs. When I need to implement a new feature in an area of the code I’m unfamiliar with I often pull up the debugger and start debugging those areas. Trying to look at the flow as if I’m debugging an issue. Inspecting the stack, members etc. to gain a better understanding of the way the system works and validate my assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started we need a simple app we can debug in the initial parts of this tutorial. For this we’ll use Prime Main which calculates prime numbers. It’s a trivial app which you can just fetch and open in your IDE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the apps are specifically unoptimized and verbose to give us more places to place breakpoints and step over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are versions of it for the various languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/e400134f01decc9639230a6a99d51eab"&gt;https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/e400134f01decc9639230a6a99d51eab&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/c454d39464ca2893c014807838c5102f"&gt;https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/c454d39464ca2893c014807838c5102f&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/8c8bbbb4297f758f7ce1d5f7a4cc1c74"&gt;https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/8c8bbbb4297f758f7ce1d5f7a4cc1c74&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/167a34571b0fae6eeed56742c44895cd"&gt;https://gist.github.com/shai-almog/167a34571b0fae6eeed56742c44895cd&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the appropriate source file and add it as the main source file in a new project in your IDE. You can run the application but take in mind that it will run for a VERY long time searching for prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#simple-conditional-breakpoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple Conditional Breakpoint
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to debug the app. In IDEs from JetBrains we just right click the executable file and select debug as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TPgxWBGs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756719807/8jHNnemXB.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TPgxWBGs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756719807/8jHNnemXB.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-19 at 15.16.43.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please notice you might need to wait for the IDE to finish scanning and indexing the files so it will show the appropriate debug action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for VSCode. Select the debug view on the left of the IDE and click the “Run and Debug” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CRqe0bJz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756764983/VKGY3QpPI.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CRqe0bJz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756764983/VKGY3QpPI.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-19 at 16.27.39.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted with an environment to use, pick Node.js to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start debugging you can set a breakpoint by clicking once on the “gutter” area to the left of the file. Let’s do a quick experiment for every file type/IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HPy5CM21--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756909711/3Ynut12B6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HPy5CM21--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756909711/3Ynut12B6.png" alt="Running on JetBrains IntelliJ/IDEA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Running on JetBrains IntelliJ/IDEA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--99XR1YXQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756974344/r-c89Vbb6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--99XR1YXQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634756974344/r-c89Vbb6.png" alt="Running on VSCode"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Running on VSCode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We place a breakpoint on line in the file. Notice that the Java file is more elaborate than the other Prime Main files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Java place the breakpoint at line 28&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Kotlin line 21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For JavaScript line 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Python line 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the breakpoint is hit you should be able to see the stack trace on the bottom left. The stack trace represents the methods that invoked the current method. At the top of the stack you see the current method. You can click on each “stack frame” to go to see the caller and the state of the variables within the caller frame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bottom right (for JetBrains) or the top left for VSCode, you can see the variables in the current stack frame. Notice n which is the number we’re calculating. Notice it isn’t a primitive but rather a BigInteger which we use to support fantastically large numbers in Java (numbers potentially larger than 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 which is the limit of Long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can change the values of variables using the “Set Value” feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WOxHTJJ4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634757073584/Thl0eRQkk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WOxHTJJ4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634757073584/Thl0eRQkk.png" alt="Setting Value in JetBrains"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Setting Value in JetBrains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Setting Value in VSCode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is extremely helpful for debugging edge cases. Just set the variable to the value you’re having trouble with and reproduce the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice JetBrains feature lets you view a value differently e.g. as hex, binary etc.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jc6ZYVCi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634757331027/tXxN9mt5p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jc6ZYVCi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634757331027/tXxN9mt5p.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-19 at 16.18.44.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we can right click on the breakpoint to edit it. We can set a condition for the breakpoint which will make execution stop only if the condition is met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v-8sS5B2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634757365298/aZkAgUrSe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v-8sS5B2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634757365298/aZkAgUrSe.png" alt="Conditional Breakpoint in JetBrains on IntelliJ/IDEA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Conditional Breakpoint Editing in VSCode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Java code is a bit different I used &lt;code&gt;primesToTest[0] == 2&lt;/code&gt; which will always be true. You can try setting it to 3 which will take a long while and you can see that it will only stop at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the other cases I used &lt;code&gt;num % 2 == 0&lt;/code&gt; as a condition that will always be false. Since the line above that line checks if a number is even which it never will be. Flipping this condition to &lt;code&gt;num % 2 == 1&lt;/code&gt; will always be true and the breakpoint will be hit.&lt;/p&gt;

  Taking this Further
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditional breakpoints are one of the most powerful yet sadly under utilized tools in the arsenal of a debugger. When you experience a failure in a loop we often walk over the loop again and again and again… Waiting for the right conditions to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using set value or a condition we can move much faster in our debugging process and possibly reproduce issues more accurately without the delays you’d normally see for stepping over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first installment of this series I tried to stress the importance of debugging skills for our daily work. Great developers use their tools effectively and efficiently to increase productivity and the debugger is a complex machine we need to wield effectively. According to some statistics debugging might be as important as our coding skills.&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately even basic features like conditional breakpoints, set value etc. are rarely used by most developers. I hope this and future posts in this series will help change that for you and help you find bugs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
