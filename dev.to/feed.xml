      <title>Amazing Things are Going to Happen</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/debs_obrien/amazing-things-are-going-to-happen-240p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am feeling absolutely amazing and I just wanted to share it all with you. It's kind of interesting in how it happened, perhaps just a process of events, but let me explain. I guess I could kind of say it's similar to when parents say their kids wake up in the morning and they see they've grown. And they say, Oh my God you've just grown. You've had a growth sprout and that's how I feel right now. Like I've grown and you're kind of going what? No, because my height is exactly the same, but I just feel I have grown right now in a way that I can't even explain. How did it happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally I went for a cycle in the mountains and it all just happened. Okay. Let me go back a little bit. No, seriously. I was cycling in the mountains. And when I'm cycling in the mountains, it's like you have a lot of time to just think and just process things. Your mind is clear and you get a lot of things out of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I just got it out of me, all the negativity that's been holding me back and stopping me from being me, all the voices that are in my head that have been stopping me from believing in myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-being-accepted"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not being Accepted
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I joined Nuxt I was working at some companies where I just didn't fit in. I wasn't accepted by people. Not just did they not believe in me. People didn't like me. People didn't want to be around me. They didn't want to work with me. Maybe it was all in my head, but it wasn't. I wished it was. But it wasn't, it was really hard. It was such a hard environment to work in. But when you work so hard to get a job in tech and you get a job, you can't just leave and go somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that easy. So now you have this great job. You have this great career, but you're working in an environment where people don't want you around. Why? I don't know. Sometimes I guess I'll never know. I was the type of person that was pushing things forward. I was making change. I was bringing change into the work environment, into technology. Not everyone is ready for change, some people just didn't want to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also probably wasn't, the best role model because I was leading a team and I wanted people to be like me, I didn't understand why people didn't want to be like me, why they didn't want to go home after work and open their computer and start watching a conference talk or go to a meetup or study or do a course or spend two hours learning something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, why would you not want to do that? Why would you want to go home and watch Netflix, for example? I was trying so hard to be better that I just kind of thought everyone else was like me and doing the same. And I probably pushed that on a lot of people. And that was probably hard for people to work with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#being-successful-can-be-hard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Being Successful can be hard
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people just didn't like my success. And that was really hard as well. I became Google Developer Expert, which was just an incredible achievement for me, but it was not acknowledged at work. When I got my Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award which was sent to the office. That's where you're spending most of your time so the award arrived at the office. And I took it out of the box and this is an absolutely beautiful award and a plaque. It was just incredible. And I put it on my desk and I was so proud that I'd achieved this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people laughed at it. People laughed at me. I seen them from the other side of the room so I brought it to my boss's attention. I told him, and he just told me that we don't celebrate success here. You should just take it home. You're just showing off and making people feel like that they're not good enough. And you're not better than anyone else. That was so hard. Instead of the company taking a picture of you with your award and saying, well done and promoting the fact that one of their employees had just become an MVP, a Microsoft most valuable professional, and using that to help their company grow. Instead of that, I just got told to take it home. It always stayed on my shelf in my room as kind of like something that I was proud of, but afraid to be proud of, afraid to feel that it was worth something good. And every day I went to work, I just didn't want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#going-to-conferences-was-my-way-of-escaping"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Going to Conferences was my way of Escaping
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's when I started going to a lot of conferences. I just wanted to go to conferences all the time. Because when I was at conferences people accepted me. People told me I was amazing. I was surrounded by these people who just had positivity and then I'd go into the office and it was all negative. It was all fights. It was battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to meetings where I would talk and people would just talk over me. In one company, I went to a meeting where I stood up to give a presentation and they all just started talking and arguing and shouting over each other. And I stood there with my arms folded thinking, I could walk out of this room right now, go and get a coffee and come back and they would not have even noticed that I had left the room. And this was my experience of giving a presentation. It was just horrible. It was so horrible. No matter what I did, people just did not accept me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went home from work in tears on many occasions, many occasions I wanted to give up. I wanted to walk away. I didn't want to be there. I had a really, really good CEO at a previous company who told me. "Don't ever give up, never, ever give up, no matter how hard it gets, people will always try and bring you down, be strong and just keep going." And so I did and I kept going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-was-destroying-my-mental-health"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It was Destroying my Mental Health
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a conference one day and when I came back, at the time I was a tech lead, they had basically moved all of the desks and chairs around and rearranged themselves, and they'd left me on the other side of the room, alone. I am meant to lead this team, but, I am not allowed sit near them or hear what's going on. And they told me, "you're a manager you can't sit with us" and I told them, "I'm a developer first, I lead the developers".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really, really hard to deal with. I kept analyzing things in my head. I kept going over everything. What am I doing wrong? Why is this happening to me? Why do people not like me? I'm not a bad person. I'm just doing my job. And I'm trying to do my job really, really well. And for some reason, people don't want me around and I didn't know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got so bad that I went on a skiing holiday and I couldn't even ski down the mountain because all this was in my head. All this was just going round and round, like a record playing, and I was analyzing and analyzing it. I just stopped on the mountain and I was in tears. I couldn't ski. It had taken over my life in such a way that it was so hard to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#speaker-friends-and-counselling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Speaker Friends and Counselling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really lucky to have had such amazing people, amazing speaker friends. One of them, gave me a counselling session, a few counselling sessions actually, and talking it over with her really helped and made me feel that it wasn't me. It's not on me. It's not my fault. I'm not doing anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I'm trying to fit in somewhere where I just don't belong. And that all these other people out there in the world think I'm amazing. Why should I focus my attention on the handful of people that don't? Focus on the people that actually want to read my blog posts, want to listen to me at a conference, want to watch my YouTube videos, concentrate on those people, because they're the ones that you need to focus your energy towards, and forget the others. Now that's such an easy thing to say, it really is, especially when you walk into the office, into a place where they're looking at you every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-power-of-thank-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Power of Thank you
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there was something really interesting she told me. She said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Instead of fighting back, you just have to stop fighting because anger with anger, hatred with hatred, no one wins. You're going to have to start doing things different and it's going to be really hard, but you can do it. You have got to use the word 'Thank You'. And the next day you go into work and they start attacking you for something or telling you you're not doing your job properly or you're wrong, or this is not good enough, you just have to answer with something like: Thank you, I'll keep that in mind. I'll improve that. And once you use the word, thank you. There's no way to fight back."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I used it, they just stood in their shoes and they were happy. And they said okay. And they walked off. I mean, obviously it wasn't a great solution. How can you work like that? Teamwork doesn't exist. But it got me through the day. It stopped the fights. It stopped the battles. And it allowed me to concentrate on moving forward, on getting out of that environment and finding another job, finding a place where I was going to be accepted and wanted, where people believed in me and where people were excited for me growing and being successful and helped me to grow and be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a couple of weeks of dealing with this and just saying, thank you. As people put me down every day, I would just say, thank you. I didn't know that, I'll improve on that. And I got on about my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-just-tried-to-not-go-to-the-office"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I just tried to not go to the Office
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really lucky that I had really good clients and I was able to focus my energy on these clients who really valued me and who wanted me around. So I just kind of constantly worked with the external clients who are brilliant and I tried to not go to the office as much as I could. I Tried to work remote, tried to go to conferences and just work from there, because that was where I was happy. And being in work, being in the office, going to work, was just not a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really lucky that after a couple of months, it took a couple of months to get there. And finally I was offered a job at Nuxt. That's when I was able to move on. But just because you change companies doesn't mean that you get rid of all that negativity that's been there for years just being thrown into you, you hold onto it for some reason, and it's not so easy to just let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-just-didnt-believe-in-myself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I just didn't Believe in myself
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you just let things go? I didn't really realize that it was still there, that all these emotions, all these voices were still there. All I knew was that I didn't believe in myself and even in my new job in Bit, when I started there after the first week, I told them "you've hired the wrong person. I'm not good enough for this job." I told them many times I'm technically not good enough. Now I'm a Google Developer Expert, a Microsoft MVP, a GitHub star, a Media Developer Expert, and I'm telling people I'm not good enough. Like that's crazy. But I didn't believe it because I had years and years of people telling me that I'm not good enough, years of people not believing in me, years of people putting me down, years of people not wanting me around, not accepting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#joining-bit-has-been-the-best-thing-ever"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Joining Bit has been the best thing ever
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for some reason, I seemed to care about them more than I cared about the rest of the world. Why? I don't know. I don't know. I think moving to Bit has really, really helped me. I've been surrounded by people who are just telling me I'm doing amazing, who are pushing me forward. I'm seeing myself grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm seeing myself doing more programming, getting better. I feel more comfortable, more. I feel stronger and the team are helping me and pushing me towards this direction. I'm working with people who are telling me that they think I'm a star. It's like, they want to work with me. And they're proud to have me on board and have me working there. And it's just such a great feeling, it's incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#receiving-the-github-star-award"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Receiving the GitHub Star Award
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when GitHub sent me the GitHub Star Award, and I have this physical award that I'm looking at thinking, wow. Like this is incredible. When I got awarded the Google Developer Expert award, I actually believed they'd sent it to the wrong person, or that they just couldn't find someone else to award it to. Seriously, I know that's crazy, but that is exactly how I felt. And even with the GitHub Star, I was like, why would people nominate me? Why do people think I'm good? Why do people think I'm a star? I'm not a star. I'm not good enough because in my head, that's all I was hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I got this award and I have it here in the place where I'm working every day, I see it every day. And then I get a GitHub Star t-shirt and a hoodie and I'm wearing them and I'm looking down and it's right there, the star. And I'm like, actually, you know what, maybe I am a star. Maybe I am actually good at what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#maybe-im-actually-really-good-at-what-i-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Maybe I'm actually really good at what I do
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I went for that cycle today in the mountains, as I'm cycling along, all these memories came back up, all these thoughts, but they all just came up and just released and all of a sudden, and I seriously don't know how, but all of a sudden they became not important. Those voices were not holding me down anymore. They're not stopping me. They don't mean anything to me anymore. And that's how I'm able to talk about it today. Whereas before, there's no way I would have talked about it. And now it's like, you know what? Maybe just, maybe I'm actually really good at what I do. Not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel now I can just grow and be better and actually just move forward instead of constantly thinking I'm not good enough or I'm not learning fast enough or I'm not able to do this. People are wrong in believing in me. I'm not good enough because actually, you know what? Just because someone tells you you're not good enough, that does not mean that, just because some people tell you you don't belong here. That does not mean you don't belong. You're just in the wrong place and right now, I'm so in the right place. I belong. I am good enough. And yeah, I am a star and I believe right now, I don't know. I really, really believe I can do anything right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#theres-no-one-stopping-me-anymore"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There's no one stopping me anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's really weird. I can't even explain it properly, but I just feel. I can do anything. There's no one holding me back anymore. There's no one stopping me. There's no one like dragging me from behind saying, you can't do this. I can just do it. And I guess I just wanted to share this story to maybe help others see that it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling that way, that you can't do it, that someone's telling you that you can't then don't listen to the negativity. Don't listen to the people who put you down. Be strong, surround yourself with the people who believe in you and listen to them and stop listening to the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-build-a-better-world"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's build a better world
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's taken me a year and a few months to get here. So it's not an easy process, but I'm here. I've made it and you can too. And now. I don't know. I just want to help others in getting there. And I'm just going to do really cool and amazing things. Just watch. Amazing things are going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't even know what, I just know it and I'm just really excited and I'm just like, yeah, let's do this together. Let's build a better world. So people don't have to go through what I went through. Let's do it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HpekK1wJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xhzrw10km8rfanyqxc0e.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HpekK1wJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xhzrw10km8rfanyqxc0e.jpeg" alt="Me and my awards"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Critical Thinking for Developers </title>
      <author>Pavel Polívka</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 06:54:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/critical-thinking-for-developers-kod</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/critical-thinking-for-developers-kod</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am positioning myself as a professional problem solver. I am usually able to figure out most of the problems thrown my way in a reasonable time and with the more or less optimal solution. Problem-solving is a skill like any other and you can work on improving it. The big part of problem-solving is something called critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-critical-thinking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is critical thinking?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking#Definitions"&gt;definitions&lt;/a&gt; out there so that you can pick the one you like. But essentially all of them are describing it as a process to process the information before you to get an answer or conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting critical thinking should lead to relying on the process when solving problems instead of leaning on assumptions (correct ones or bad ones). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-it-important-for-me"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is it important for me?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem-solving/critical thinking is one of those things that make a good developer the best one. The ability to solve unexpected issues as they come, the ability to challenge your requirements to make improvements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent most of our days doing stuff on autopilot (showering, eating, etc..) and we tend to do the same when working. We get a ticket to add some feature, we do it not thinking if it makes sense. Etc... Applying critical thinking makes us better developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-way-of-the-critical-thinker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The way of the critical thinker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of ways you can approach critical thinking. It's not an exact science. I will sum up the most important point below but it's up to you to decide what works best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ask-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ask questions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, this is the most important one. Always ask questions. Question everything. Start with the most basic questions. You would be surprised how often those are the ones that will give you the right answer. The most elegant solutions are elegant because they are simple, not because they are the most complex solutions available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some examples you can start with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are you doing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this really necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you already know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you know that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your exact goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you overlooking? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I look at this differently? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I know I succeeded? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would be affected by this? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a definitive list. You can add/remove questions however you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to have an answer to every question you ask yourself. Discuss those points with your manager/business owner/customer. The important thing is you need to understand what problem are you solving, why, and possibly if this does not introduce more problems elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always ask in such a way so that you can constructive feedback. Sending a list of questions to a person via email, without explanation, etc.. will not get you very far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-not-assume"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do not assume
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is related to the first point. I cannot count how many times the wrong assumption took me on a wild chase. If you assume something it's always better to verify. Often you will find out that your wrong assumption is held by more people than you. Do not let that scare you. The biggest innovators of their time often found a wrong assumption held by the general population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to assumptions is intuition. Often you look at an issue and intuitively know what to do. That is fine. It usually works out for you, especially after you get more experience on the matter. But be careful here, do not waste too much time if your intuition does not lead to success immediately. Go back to the process when there are first signs of issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-not-reinvent-the-wheel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do not reinvent the wheel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to get away and start to implement awesome new solutions on greenfield, you can do what you want, write as much code as you want, etc... For most situations, this is not a very good or responsible solution. There probably is already made solution. Search for it. Do your research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for a company that wanted to implement CMS with a bit complex publishing system. We did our research and did not find any product that would fit our needs. We decided to implement everything from scratch. That was a very bad solution to the problem. We wanted a complex publishing solution. We should have a focus on that. We did not need to implement editor, UI for front-end developers, UI for copywriters. We ended up with middle-the-road CMS experience, our publishing pipeline had issues years after because we did devote enough resources to it. It was just a part of the project. We should have bought state-of-the-art CMS and focus our work on the publishing system. That would be the smart thing to do. Without reinventing the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#think-for-yourself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Think for yourself
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not forget you have an opinion as well. It can be the fact that you spent most of your time with research, it can be that someone on your team is louder than you even tho you are not agreeing with them. Voice your opinion. Do not present it as a fact or sure thing, but voice it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#no-one-is-perfect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  No one is perfect
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody can apply this 100% of the time (unless you are Sheldon from Big Bang Theory) this is a tool that should be used when you need to solve problems or decide on important decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kyF8oaE7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fphlsa5a81iycwclqkeu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kyF8oaE7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fphlsa5a81iycwclqkeu.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_banking#:~:text=Core%20banking%20is%20a%20banking,of%20the%20member%20branch%20offices."&gt;core banking&lt;/a&gt; (Centralized Online Real-Time Exchange) ensures synchronization among network bank branches. They are integrated with a centralized server that enables the processing of data in real-time. It allows customers to access their bank account details and perform basic transactions from any branch offices. Core banking functionalities include loans, mortgages, transactions, and payments which were traditionally available through ATM or branches. And the core banking software development with network technology enables a bank to centralize its record-keeping while providing access to bank account transactions from any location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-build-core-banking-software"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Build Core Banking Software?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banking system around the globe had been witnessing a positive beam for the past few years having stable ratings across most countries. It was progressing and preparing for the next wave of blockchain technology and AI-backed technologies as its central point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the sudden rise of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in complete lockdown entirely changed the concept of businesses, banking and everything else globally. It threw the banking sector into the spotlight persisting it to adapt digitization overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This epidemic has become the turning point for the banking sector and its customers. The rising omnipresence of digital devices has put the powers in the hands of the end customers. Therefore, making customer experience paramount across all the industries where banking is no exception too. Some of the banks or financial organizations have realized the urgency of developing meaningful banking experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#goals-of-core-banking-software-system"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Goals of Core Banking Software System
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Core Banking Software System works towards &lt;a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/customer-experience-web-design"&gt;improving customer experience&lt;/a&gt;. It assures customer’s comfort and satisfaction while enabling banking anytime and anywhere. With the implementation of technology, different approaches have been discovered to ease out all the services and software development is one of those discoveries as well. It offers essential functions like keeping track of deposits, transfers, ledgers, customer details, loan accounts, and so much more that was once carried out manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multiple operations of core banking software allow the bank to store information in the correct format. Moreover, all the stored information can be obtained efficiently through an authentication mechanism. With the facts and statistics, this modern tech helps employees and clients to make intelligent decisions. It also helps to produce and offer legislative and regulatory reports to the government regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#primary-features-amp-functionality-of-core-banking-software"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/core-banking-software-development"&gt;Primary Features &amp;amp; Functionality of Core Banking Software&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the top features that a core banking software must have are security alerts, chatbot integrations, bank account management, multi-currency feature, ATM finder, QR based payments and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig a bit deeper into these features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Security Alerts &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Protection and confidentiality are the two main factors for banking software. It’s essential for the banks to ensure that their systems are safe and the information stored is secured. Some of the apps also have features like touch ID or voice or face recognition for enhanced security. So, developers ensure to make a system that detects any fraudulent activity and send security alerts to both the bank and the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Chatbot Integrations &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to provide 24/7 support to the customers who need guidance while using the &lt;a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/web-app-development-company"&gt;web app&lt;/a&gt; or banking software. Here, the best choice for you will be AI chatbot integration that will easily address hundreds of clients at the same time instantly. Needless to say, they can run for hours and will never get exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bank Account Management &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Another essential feature to include in your core banking software solution is bank account management. Users should be able to track their accounts and other banking information like deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history. Not only that, but they should also be able to make transactions through the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Multi-Currency Availability &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; To promote the concept of multicultural banking, an ideal core banking system should be multilingual, that is, setting up different currencies, choosing their base currency, accounting for the base and multiple currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; QR Payments &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; One of the features that have become a fintech trend - QR pay, must be indulged in your banking software for the ease of scan pay directly from their web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mobile Deposit &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It might sound like sci-fi material to some individuals who still banks conventionally, but mobile deposit or remote deposit control has become the most popular features of core banking software. It will require scanning and transmitting a picture of a check to a banking organization which saves a lot of customer’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; A Few More Functions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Other than that there are a few features that you can integrate into your software are Interest Rate Calculator, Loan Processing, Advanced Analytics and Payment History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-a-core-banking-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Much Does It Cost to Develop a Core Banking App?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a core banking software can cost $200,000 to $500,000. However, development costs are unpredictable during the earlier stages of development. A few factors affecting its cost entails vendor type, location, complexity, the number of features, back-end infrastructure, connected APIs, the complexity of UX/UI design, development approach, the inclusion of additional branded visual elements and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the performance of your software is influenced by the &lt;a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/frontend-developer-roadmap-2020"&gt;front-end&lt;/a&gt; or design of the application with some unbeatable innovative features. It will also help a bank gain new clients, build a positive consumer experience and competitive benefits.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Persona-based architecture</title>
      <author>Chakrit Likitkhajorn</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 05:33:17 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/chrisza4/persona-based-architecture-c09</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developers always dream about a maintainable system. We longed for a simple system that is easy to work with. It should be easy to change, debug and observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a concept called clean code and clean architecture in order to pursue that dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clean architecture? There is a definition defined by &lt;a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html"&gt;Uncle Bob&lt;/a&gt;. It must be independent of a framework. It must be independent of UI, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything seems good. Since we have a solid ground on what a clean code is, we should already achieve a maintainable codebase, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, whenever I had a conversation with developers who work with those clean architecture patterns. I asked them how it is in practice. Does the team become more effective? Do the team happy with the codebase?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer usually goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, it is not really easy for a common developer. They need to learn multiple concepts and take a lot of time to become effective."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait. In a quest to chase a maintainable codebase, we accidentally created a codebase that is hard to maintain, did we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#practical-maintainability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Practical maintainability
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have no issue working with great architectural patterns such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)"&gt;Hexagonal Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html"&gt;CQRS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/"&gt;Flux&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://microservices.io/"&gt;Microservices&lt;/a&gt;. I learned about this pattern for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I work in a team of 10 developers, does it matter if I am the only one out of nine who knows about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that a maintainable codebase must have dependency inversion, low coupling, high cohesion, follow SOLID principle, follow DRY principle, etc. Surprisingly, when we follow all the maintainable codebase rules and at the end, the team might find it hard to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens? Are we chasing an illusion of a maintainable codebase? Are we a bunch of sheep that blindly follow the shepherd rules with false hope of promised maintainable land?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think when we follow all those rules and theories, we achieve theoretical maintainability. Any codebase with all those characteristics should be maintainable, in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, I think maintainability should simply be defined like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A maintainable codebase is a codebase that a team can effectively work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it—such a simple definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those rules about dependency inversion, coupling, cohesion, SOLID, DRY are just tools to achieve the dream. We should understand those concepts in order to create a maintainable codebase. But they should never be viewed as a goal in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the CQRS codebase maintainable? If a team finds it easy to work with, then yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the maintainability of any codebase never depends on whether you do things in the right way or follow best practices. While it helps, it is not a deciding factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all depends on &lt;strong&gt;humans&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, those fuzzy emotional unreliable humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-with-human"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working with human
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, a software architect said this to me: Software Architect is a very special role. We are responsible for the overall quality of the codebase. We know the quality of the codebase depends on developers. And yet, we don't have any power to hold those developers accountable. We can only design, convince, and maybe set some rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A path toward maintainable architecture is such a vague path. Since it all depends on humans, there is no correct answer. No matter what you do, you might be right, or you might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software engineers are familiar with working with binary. There will always be a right way. Code should either compiled or error. Code should either pass a test or fail a test. Everything should be consistent and reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, humans are not consistent at all. Today a human can love one thing, and tomorrow they might hate it. They might say our codebase is the best codebase ever today, and in the next few months, they might want to rewrite everything from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we work with humans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to introduce you to two fields that are pretty much in the same spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first field is the design field. Designers never have direct control over users, yet they need to design both UX and UI to guide users to do the right thing. Their career pretty much depends on the user doing the right thing while still happy with the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second field is the economic field. Economic planners never have direct control over the population behavior, yet they need to create a system that incentivizes people to a certain economic direction. Otherwise, the whole nation failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always fascinated by behavioral economics. How can you introduce a policy? How will people react to that? What will be the consequence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many tools and ways of thinking from those fields that we can apply to software architecture. I can name many. Design thinking, User testing, Unintended consequence, Game Theory, etc. All those tools are applicable to software architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today, I will write about a tool that I steal from the design field: &lt;strong&gt;Persona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#persona"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Persona
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, here is a definition of persona&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A persona (also user persona, customer persona, buyer persona) in user-centered design and marketing is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, whenever designers design anything, they create a fictional character of their user. And we can adopt this practice of creating a fictional character of maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to create a persona in product development. To get back to software architecture, I think persona of maintainers should consist of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context. What is the experience level of our fellow developers? What is their role? What will they do on a day-to-day basis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectation. Based on context and our design, what are our expectations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context helps you empathize with the capability, limitation, and habit of maintainers. That will be an architectural design constraint. On the other hand, expectation helps you understand what you expect from each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let say we want to adopt microservice architecture. Here is a persona example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zh94_S5e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/persona-based-architecture/Personas.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zh94_S5e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/persona-based-architecture/Personas.png" alt="Persona"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might start with either the context side or the expectation side. We might start by asking ourselves: here what I want from our maintainers. What kind of people are they? Or you might start by: here are our maintainers. What can I expect? It works both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by writing down persona, we make a connection between maintainer and expectation clearer and more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#persona-testing-context-side"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Persona testing: Context side
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have persona, you need to test your persona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very simple. We just look at actual maintainers and see if they fit the description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ke9UXTpW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/persona-based-architecture/Persona%2520testing%2520context.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ke9UXTpW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/persona-based-architecture/Persona%2520testing%2520context.png" alt="Persona testing context"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, we identify the gap between the actual maintainers and our ideal maintainers. Mark doesn't have 6 years of experience, but he understands distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all gaps are clearly identified, we have many choices to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a clear choice of changing our architecture to fit the maintainers, we can also provide a training and capability improvement program. We can switch some team members around with other projects. We can hire someone from the outside that matches a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can even set a standard and career development. We can bring your persona to all those junior and say: We want you to be this person within a year. Once you obtain these, we can talk about promotion and next step in your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above are some examples of what we can do once gaps are clearly identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you now see the value of writing down persona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing I want you to be prepared. Seeing these gaps might lead to some hard conversations, and we might not feel comfortable about these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that this approach works much better than design for the best and pray for the rest approach. It works much better than blindly adopting microservice, and in the end, all maintainers just want to quit or kill the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard this kind of story so many times. Architecture implements fancy architecture and creates a big gap between what should happen and what actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those gaps will not go away just because we don't think about it. So let us be mentally prepared and confront those gaps heads-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#persona-testing-expectation-side"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Persona testing: Expectation side
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we adjust our context, we still might be wrong about expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we might think that our maintainers can independently create new feature. We might think that a senior developer will be able to facilitate post-mortem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zSGydoSE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/persona-based-architecture/Persona%2520testing%2520Expectation.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zSGydoSE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/persona-based-architecture/Persona%2520testing%2520Expectation.png" alt="Persona testing context"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have expectations and context written down, it opens up an opportunity to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe our maintainers need more training and knowledge than we initially thought. Perhaps the way we separate our domain does not enable our maintainer to contribute. Maybe our maintainers are stuck in some legacy process or legacy code that we don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many possible causes and possible solutions. As in product development field said, we will never get our assumption right until we launch a product into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we know exactly where we wrong, we can make it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is better to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I thought microservice was going to allow the team to be autonomous. It turns out that they still depend on many external services. We need to bring those services back together and rethink how we draw our domain boundaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We tried, and Microservices just does not fit us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it is better to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I thought a programmer with 6 years of Java development experience which demonstrates capability in OOP should be able to handle this. That is where I am wrong. It seems that the Java experience is irrelevant here. We need someone who understands how the distributed system works to maintain this system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need better programmers to maintain this system. Please hire only top class programmers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And personas allow you to say these types of sentences with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the path forward is to change our architectural decision or improve maintainers' capability, it is much better to be explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is ok if you don't optimize your architecture for maintainers, as long as you make it clear why and what do you expect instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With persona, you have a clear message to all stakeholders about what you expect. You can have a meaningful conversation on how to adjust according to hiring and capability limitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#side-benefits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Side Benefits
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a software architecture perspective, having a clear persona can be a tool to connect many aspects of software engineering management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring - What is a job description? Persona!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career growth - How shall we set junior developer expectations? Persona!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capability building - What kind of training should we provide this year? Persona!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a position of tech lead who responsible for both management and architecture, and having a persona in mind helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#endnote"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Endnote
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I introduce the concept of practical maintainability. And I think software architects should strive for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to practical maintainability, it's all about real humans rather than rules, processes, and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the software engineering field, we mainly focus on binary and concept. In some other fields, they have many tools to deal with human inconsistency. We can learn a lot from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful in software architecture design, you rely on humans. Persona is one of many tools to help you layout dependency between your structure and human behavior. Persona testing helps you understand how your design actually works in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have everything visualize, you have the power to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that just like every other type of architect, a software architect is supposed to solve a human problem. Architecture should serve human needs, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Things You Need to Know About Web Accessibility</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/trastanechora/things-you-need-to-know-about-web-accessibility-52dp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every website owner wants to attract as many visitors as possible. However, few take the steps necessary to ensure their site can be used by everyone. There are millions of users out there who rely on sites being accessible, and if you don’t take the time to understand their needs, everyone will be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that millions of internet users have special needs, disabilities, and impairments that can make it difficult or even impossible for them to use certain types of websites. By designing your site with these challenges in mind, you can ensure that it’s welcoming to as many users as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are a lot of disabilities and conditions that can affect the way people use websites, let’s take a look at some of the most common categories of impairments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Visual Impairment&lt;/strong&gt;: This includes a partial or total inability to see or to perceive color contrasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hearing Impairment&lt;/strong&gt;: Some users have a reduced ability to hear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Motor Skills/Physical Disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Users may have difficulty moving parts of their bodies, including making precise movements (such as when using a mouse).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Photosensitive Seizures&lt;/strong&gt;: Conditions such as epilepsy can cause seizures that are often triggered by flashing lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: There are also many conditions that affect cognitive ability, such as dementia and dyslexia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work around these issues, many people use assistive technologies to browse the internet. This includes screen readers that vocalize the text on each page, speech recognition software that converts speech into text, Braille terminals, and even alternative keyboards that accommodate special needs.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-brief-introduction-to-web-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Brief Introduction to Web Accessibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when websites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-accessibility-from-developers-perspective"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Accessibility From Developer's Perspective
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-accessibility-from-users-perspective"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Accessibility From User's Perspective
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines and Success Criteria are organized around the following four principles, which lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use Web content. Anyone who wants to use the Web must have content that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Perceivable&lt;/b&gt; - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Operable&lt;/b&gt; - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Understandable&lt;/b&gt; - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Robust&lt;/b&gt; - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-meet-accessibility-standards"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Meet Accessibility Standards
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"&gt;Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)&lt;/a&gt; develops web accessibility standards for the &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"&gt;Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)&lt;/a&gt;, these guidelines overview addresses web content, and is used by developers, authoring tools, and accessibility evaluation tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility guidelines are based on the fundamental technical specifications of the web, and are developed in coordination with all W3C technical specifications (HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, etc.). W3C also develops technical specifications that directly address accessibility, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, which defines a way to make web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-should-i-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where Should I Start
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, the first step along the accessibility road is conducting an accessibility audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a manual review of a website against the latest &lt;a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/"&gt;WCAG 2.1 guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. This will identify where your website does and does not comply and give you an action plan of how to fix the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This checklist uses The WCAG as a reference point. The WCAG is a shared standard for web content accessibility for individuals, organizations, and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues this checklist prompts you to check for covers a wide range of disability conditions. There is no such thing as “perfect accessibility” or a site being “100% accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once changes have been made, your website should be re-audited to check all the issues have been rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also do the automated check with &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse"&gt;Lighthouse audit&lt;/a&gt; for accessibility from Chrome dev tools or &lt;a href="https://web.dev/measure/"&gt;web.dev&lt;/a&gt; if the site is already deployed.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-content-with-accessibility-in-mind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create Content With Accessibility in Mind
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While designing your site for accessibility is hugely important, you should bear the same considerations in mind when creating content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means paying attention to relatively minor things, such as always fully writing out acronyms, to more important points, like making sure you give all your links unique, descriptive names and anchor text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at a few ways you can make your website more accessible right away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-make-sure-your-site-is-keyboardfriendly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Make Sure Your Site Is Keyboard-Friendly
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for a website to be accessible, it must work without the use of a mouse. This is because many assistive technologies rely on keyboard-only navigation. As such, it must be possible to use all of your site’s major features via a keyboard and nothing else. This includes accessing all pages, links, content, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A keyboard user typically uses the Tab key to navigate through interactive elements on a web page—links, buttons, fields for inputting text, etc. When an item is tabbed to, it has keyboard "focus" and can be activated or manipulated with the keyboard. A sighted keyboard user must be provided with a visual indicator of the element that currently has keyboard focus. Focus indicators are provided automatically by web browsers. While their appearance varies based on the browser, the focus indicator is typically shown as a border or highlight (called an outline) around the focused element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about Keyboard-Friendly please learn &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-make-sure-all-content-is-easily-accessible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Make Sure All Content Is Easily Accessible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to making your site keyboard-friendly, you also need to ensure that all content on the page is actually accessible. While this is usually not a problem, it can be an issue when a page contains dynamic content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, content is dynamic if it can change without the page it’s on reloading. This can become a problem if the site doesn’t inform assistive tools of the change. For example, many screen readers will only “read” the site as it appears when it first loads. As such, you need to make it aware when something shifts, or the user will miss the new content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way you can do this is by using ARIA landmarks. These are tags you add to content in order to clearly define it on the page. You can tag dynamic content as a “live region,” which enables screen readers and similar devices to understand the content as it changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARIA is also useful for making navigation more straightforward as it lets users skip directly to specific content. This way, they won’t have to tab through every menu item just to get to your main content and can easily pass over other link-heavy sections. The same effect can be achieved using skip-to-main links, which are invisible links that let users skip menus. However, ARIA tends to be more flexible and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;banner&lt;/strong&gt; = contains the site-oriented content of each page, like the logo, usually located at the top of the page. There should only be one banner landmark per page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;complementary&lt;/strong&gt; = a section of content that complements the main content but also retains its meaning when separated from the main content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;contentinfo&lt;/strong&gt; = contains content usually found in the footer of a page, like copyright and privacy statements. There should only be one contentinfo landmark per page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt; = contains form input elements which can be edited and submitted by the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt; = the main content of the page. There should only be one main landmark per page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;navigation&lt;/strong&gt; = a collection of navigation links to navigate the site or page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;search&lt;/strong&gt; = a search tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;application&lt;/strong&gt; = represents a unique software unit, and keyboard commands are handled by the application rather than the browser itself. This role should be used sparingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="nav" role="navigation"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Products&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Support&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case the screen reader user will hear something like “navigation landmark.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should not place the “role” attribute on another element that already has semantic meaning, like a &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;. It should only be placed on &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about ARIA please learn &lt;a href="https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/it-accessibility-at-nc-state/developers/accessibility-handbook/aria-landmarks/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-add-alt-text-to-all-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Add Alt Text to All Images
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This text acts as a replacement for the image if it fails to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qsdx0hAU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x8ihat7yyutwhgml6wa2.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qsdx0hAU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x8ihat7yyutwhgml6wa2.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;example photo with alt text "photo of a green plant"&lt;br&gt;
However, alt text (sometimes called alt attributes, alt descriptions, or alt tags) is also accessed by screen readers to “read” the picture. You can, therefore, use this field to describe an image, giving context to users who would otherwise miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that weren’t enough, alt text can also help you improve your site’s SEO, giving search engines more information to crawl. Just make sure to write descriptive summaries of each image, and try to include your keywords whenever it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about Alt Text please learn &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-choose-your-colors-carefully"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Choose Your Colors Carefully
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often talk about color blindness as if it’s a, no pun intended, black-and-white issue. However, it’s more of a spectrum since different people perceive colors in unique ways. As such, you need to make sure the colors you select on your site contrast well to ensure that everyone can distinguish between various elements on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most pressing issue is making sure text stands out against the background. Ideally, you should set a dark color against a light one, making sure that they don’t bleed into each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to use a blue color scheme. You’d want to avoid creating a palette where the shades are too similar in hue and saturation, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NtaebE3d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6reuky9dmo6dsufyct83.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NtaebE3d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6reuky9dmo6dsufyct83.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very difficult to read. Instead, a clearer color contrast works much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CxdozFi8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/28xnfkfebpkpnaxv76r9.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CxdozFi8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/28xnfkfebpkpnaxv76r9.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of online tools you can use to find and test color combinations. You can &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"&gt;try this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-use-headers-to-structure-your-content-correctly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Use Headers to Structure Your Content Correctly
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key task to make your site accessible is structuring your content by using headers carefully. Doing this will make your content much easier to understand and digest and improves flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, clear headers also help screen readers interpret your pages. This makes it much easier to provide in-page navigation. It’s also simple to do as you only need to ensure you use the correct heading levels in your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you should only use one H1 per page – usually as the page title. This can be followed by subheadings starting with H2, which can then be nested further with H3, followed by H4. These should always be used in order so you should avoid using an H4 directly after an H2 (and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about headers please learn &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-design-your-forms-for-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Design Your Forms for Accessibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms are a useful addition to most sites but must be designed carefully. What’s most important is to ensure that each field is clearly labeled. You should also aim to place the labels adjacent to the respective fields. While a sighted user can easily match a label to the corresponding field or option, this may not be obvious for someone using a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also aim to provide instructions and information in a clear way that the user can easily understand. To create accessible forms in WordPress, you can use a tool like the Caldera Forms builder. This is a plugin specifically focused on accessibility, which will make your job much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about headers please learn &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-it-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping It Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making sure your site is welcoming to as many people as possible should be a top priority. There’s no reason to exclude anybody, especially since it’s relatively easy to avoid doing so. Not only will your users thank you, but you’ll also likely see benefits in the form of increased traffic and conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leveling up with React: React Router</title>
      <author>Neha Soni</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 05:26:21 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/nehasoni__/leveling-up-with-react-react-router-1npe</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world👋&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this blog article, we will learn React router's concept and build a simple &lt;strong&gt;single-page app(SPA)&lt;/strong&gt; using react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-will-be-covered-in-this-blog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What will be covered in this Blog
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Introduction to react-router-dom
- React Router Components
- React Router Installation
- Let’s create the SPA
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-reactrouterdom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is react-router-dom?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routing is the key part of all the web-applications. It plays a central role in static HTML pages as well as in the most complex React web applications. React router is a standard library that enables you to navigate between the different pages without reloading your whole page. It keeps the browser URL in sync with UI(data that will be displayed on the web page). It is mainly used for building single-page web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#different-packages-in-react-router-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Different packages in React Router library
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Router library contains three different npm packages for routing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;react-router&lt;/strong&gt; provides a core routing library that that is used as a peer dependency for the other two packages listed below.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;react-router-native&lt;/strong&gt; is mainly used for  &lt;a href="https://reactnative.dev/"&gt;React native&lt;/a&gt;  applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/strong&gt; is used in React apps for routing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-router-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React Router Components
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic React Router components commonly used in minimal navigation are BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, and Link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/h3&gt;
A BrowserRouter uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState, and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. To enable the client-side routing we need to import &lt;strong&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;react-dom-router&lt;/strong&gt; package and also wrap our entire application inside BrowserRouter.
If you aren’t familiar with client-side routing, you can learn it from  &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@wilbo/server-side-vs-client-side-routing-71d710e9227f"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
    &amp;lt;BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;App /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/BrowserRouter&amp;gt;,
  rootElement
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Switch&lt;/h3&gt;
The Switch component will only render the first route that matches/includes the path
rather than rendering all matching routes. It doesn't take any props. Also, it allows for nested routes to work properly, which is something that Router will not be able to handle.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
 &amp;lt;BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;Switch&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;Route path="/signin" component={SignIn} /&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;Route path="/signup" component={SignUp} /&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/Switch&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/BrowserRouter&amp;gt;,
         rootElement
   );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Route&lt;/h3&gt;
The route is used to render the component based on the specified path. It is generally defined with two props- path and component. Here, the path represents the URL route and the component represents the page or the component that we want to render on that path. If the path for a route is set to just "/", &lt;code&gt;Switch&lt;/code&gt; would always render that route for all paths as it is a match. For example, if the path we’re on is &lt;code&gt;/signin&lt;/code&gt;, this path does include a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. As long as it includes the character, it will be considered a match, which does include nested routes.
To solve this problem, we include another prop for that route, &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt;. As the name implies, the path has to be the same. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
 &amp;lt;BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home} /&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;Route path="/signin" component={SignIn} /&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;Route path="/signup" component={SignUp} /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/BrowserRouter&amp;gt;,
         rootElement
   );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Link&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name indicates this component is used to create links that allow the application to navigate on different URLs and render its content without reloading the whole webpage. It is defined with only one prop- &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; represents where to redirect upon click.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Link to="/sample"&amp;gt;Click to redirect&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#time-to-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Time to Code!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ll explain how I created a simple SPA using React Routing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To get started, first, let’s create a React app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app routing-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t familiar with this command, you can learn more from the  &lt;a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/"&gt;create-react-app getting started guide&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, install the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom"&gt; react-router-dom&lt;/a&gt;  package.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install react-router-dom
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, start the dev server&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then, add the dependency react-router-dom in package.json.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let's start creating content pages first-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First, create a file home.js in src directory and add the following content:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;home.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React, { Component } from "react";

class Home extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Welcome to Hashnode!!&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Hashnode is the easiest way to start a developer blog on your 
        personal domain 🌏 for free and connect with the readers through 
        our global dev community! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    );
  }
}

export default Home;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, create a signin.js file in the same location:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;signin.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React, { Component } from "react";


class SignIn extends Component {
    handleClick  = ()=&amp;gt;
    {
            alert("Thank you for signing in 😀.");
    }

    render() {
    return (
        &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div className="home"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;SignIN&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Username&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="text" placeholder="Enter username"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Password&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="password" placeholder="Enter password"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;button
            className="btn btn-success" 
            onClick={this.handleClick}&amp;gt;
            SignIN
            &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
        );
  }
}

export default SignIn;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We just have one more page left. Create signup.js file in src folder:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;signup.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React, { Component } from "react";

class SignUp extends Component {

    handleClick  = ()=&amp;gt;
    {
            alert("Thank you for signing in 😀.");
    }

    render() {
    return (
        &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div className="home"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;SignUp&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Username&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="text" placeholder="Enter username"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Enter Email&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="email" placeholder="Enter your Email"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Password&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;input type="password" placeholder="Enter password"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;button className="btn btn-success" 
            onClick={this.handleClick}&amp;gt;
            SignUp
            &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
        );
  }
}

export default SignUp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is all we are going to show on our web page. Make sure to save all of your changes to these three files. We'll look at how to make them useful shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's start working on our App.js file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We have our app frame in the form of our &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component. We have our content pages represented by the &lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SignIn&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SignUp&lt;/code&gt; components. What we need to do is tie all of these together to create our app. This is where React Router comes in. To start using it, go to the App.js file, and import the below packages:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from 'react';
import {
  Route,
  Link,
  BrowserRouter
} from "react-router-dom";
import Home from './home.js';
import SignIn from './signin.js';
import SignUp from './signup.js';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are importing Route, Link, and BrowserRouter from the react-router-dom npm package we installed earlier. In addition, we are also importing our Home, SignIn, and SignUp components. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from 'react';
import {
  Route,
  Link,
  BrowserRouter
} from "react-router-dom";
import Home from './home.js';
import SignIn from './signin.js';
import SignUp from './signup.js';

class App extends React.Component {  
render() {  
 return ( 
     &amp;lt;BrowserRouter&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;  
   &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Simple SPA&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;  
        &amp;lt;ul className="header"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Link to="/"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Link to="/signin"&amp;gt;SignIn&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Link to="/signup"&amp;gt;SignUp&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;div className="content"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home}/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Route exact path="/signin" component={SignIn}/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Route exact path="/signup" component={SignUp}/&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
    )  
 }  
}  
export default App;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I already explained the function and need of everything we have used in our App.js file. Hope you understand things clearly. In case you have any doubt let me know in the comment section. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding Some CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Right now, our app is completely unstyled. In your src folder, create a file called style.css and add the following style rules into it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  background-color: #FFCC00;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 25px;
}
h1, h2, p, ul, li {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
ul.header li {
  display: inline;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
}
ul.header {
  background-color: #111;
  padding: 0;
}
ul.header li a {
  color: #FFF;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 20px;
  display: inline-block;
}
a:hover
{
    background-color: blue;
}
.content {
  background-color: #FFF;
  padding: 20px;
}
.content h2 {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
.content li {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
input
{
  width: 100%;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  margin: 8px 0;
  display: inline-block;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-size: 18px;
}
button
{
    width: 30%;
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 14px 20px;
  margin: 8px 0;
  margin-left: 500px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are almost done here! There are just a few more things we need to do.&lt;br&gt;
We need to reference this style sheet in our app. At the top of index.js, add the import statement to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App.js';
import './style.css';


ReactDOM.render(
&amp;lt;BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;App/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/BrowserRouter&amp;gt;, 
  document.getElementById("root")
);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you have followed all the steps, go to our browser and your webpage looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hyIujgJH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617028242453/jE2edDd5_.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hyIujgJH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617028242453/jE2edDd5_.png" alt="Screenshot (149).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click on the SignIn button the path changes to &lt;code&gt;/signin&lt;/code&gt; and the page will navigate to &lt;em&gt;SignIn&lt;/em&gt; component without reloading your application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1UTwnxim--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617028446460/pphGDwsxF.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1UTwnxim--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617028446460/pphGDwsxF.png" alt="Screenshot (152).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Similarly, when you click on the SignUp button the path changes to &lt;code&gt;/signup&lt;/code&gt; and the page will navigate to  &lt;em&gt;SignUp&lt;/em&gt; component without reloading your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EvkXYZjg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617028804146/3GyM-o7qK.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EvkXYZjg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617028804146/3GyM-o7qK.png" alt="Screenshot (153).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React router is an awesome tool that could be of great help to your application. I hope this Demo provides an introductory guide to React Router.&lt;/p&gt;

  How Does It Work?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the website says, there are &lt;strong&gt;no simulations or boring tutorials&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zeaAaFf0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b23hfuaa8imz7lxgp3ws.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zeaAaFf0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b23hfuaa8imz7lxgp3ws.png" alt="Learning"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You learn new skills while &lt;strong&gt;working on your own copy of a real project&lt;/strong&gt;, with the instructions and feedback provided by the GitHub Bot. And the bot does so interacting with you &lt;strong&gt;via the Issues and Pull Requests sections of the project&lt;/strong&gt;. It basically "&lt;em&gt;force you&lt;/em&gt;" to work on the issues, like you would do in a &lt;strong&gt;real project&lt;/strong&gt; hosted on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn, you can follow pre-defined &lt;strong&gt;Learning Paths&lt;/strong&gt;, or you can freely choose the course, topic, or even languages you want to learn. Just scroll down on the page, and you will have a selection of many, &lt;strong&gt;many different learning possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a-6ZOPWN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jc2m3v5u52jq2qn8l0ne.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a-6ZOPWN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jc2m3v5u52jq2qn8l0ne.png" alt="Learning Paths"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even learn &lt;strong&gt;Enterprise-related topics and skills&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can always &lt;strong&gt;search for other topics&lt;/strong&gt;, if want something different from the highlighted ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the great content and the way it works, &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Learning Lab is ideal for both beginners&lt;/strong&gt; who want to learn GitHub from scratch and &lt;strong&gt;users that are already familiar&lt;/strong&gt; with GitHub but want to improve in some specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's see how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#video"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Video
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better show how GitHub Learning Lab works, I've created a video with a comprehensive demo, because this is much better shown then told... So you can see by yourself how incredibly easy and effective the whole experience is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HCHvMngWEbY"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HCHvMngWEbY"&gt;Link to the video: https://youtu.be/HCHvMngWEbY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demo starts at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HCHvMngWEbY?t=127"&gt;minute 2:07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think of the GitHub Learning Lab? I think it is great that they have &lt;strong&gt;so much content completely for free&lt;/strong&gt;. And the format works perfectly, because you get to &lt;strong&gt;do things rather than just following some tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yBpwaYpv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jkta9liuux8s7sce6oxb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yBpwaYpv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jkta9liuux8s7sce6oxb.png" alt="Progress"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fact that the bot "force you" to work through issues like you would do in a real project it's a &lt;strong&gt;big plus&lt;/strong&gt; for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know your thoughts in the comment section below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>13 Time-Saving Tools for Web Developers and Designers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, in this day and age we are a generation obsessed with the latest gadgets and gizmos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the latest in gaming consoles all the way to cutting-edge mobile devices, we are hooked not only the Internet, but on technology in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the prevalence of websites and the apparent ease of designing them, web developers spend long days and nights creating functional and appealing web designs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but they also have to code, work out bugs in their designs, and find ways to make their sites better than before. Luckily for them, there are tools out there that allow those tough tasks to be a little bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of web-based apps and tools for both the novice and veteran web developer to use while on their journey, and today I’ll share a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free APIs That Nobody Is Talking About</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;othing excites me more than finding an out of the ordinary API.Many times we just want to focus on the frontend but also Need interesting, dynamic data to display.This is where public APIs come into play. API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface.The core benefit of using it is that it allows one program to interact with other programs.Using public APIs allows you to focus on the frontend and things that matter without worrying so much about the database and the backend.Below are 7 less-talked about public and free APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evil Insult Generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you tried to insult your best friend? Now you have got a helping hand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the API name suggests, the goal is to offer some of the evilest insults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create an app centered around this API or combine this API with other excellent APIs provided below like implementing the generated insults in meme templates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Add a Favorite Button with MB Favorite Posts Solution</title>
      <author>WP Meta Box Plugin</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 03:28:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/wpmetabox/how-to-add-a-favorite-button-with-mb-favorite-posts-solution-jbn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/wpmetabox/how-to-add-a-favorite-button-with-mb-favorite-posts-solution-jbn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to add a button for users to save a post to their Favorite lists, and then read it again? MB Favorite Posts solution of Meta Box is surely a useful tool for you to do this simply and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MB Favorite Posts is a solution of Meta Box for users having bought &lt;a href="https://metabox.io/pricing/"&gt;lifetime bundles&lt;/a&gt; of Meta Box. This solution provides you with all the needed tools and features to add a Favorite button. Using it, users can choose their favorite posts to save in their own lists. More than that, users can access their lists to read the posts they like one more time. MB Favorite Posts solution can &lt;strong&gt;automatically create a Favorite button&lt;/strong&gt;, and you can &lt;strong&gt;customize it easily&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, let’s see through some impressive benefits of Favorite buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why to Use a Favorite Button?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Favorite button can help you in many cases. Using this button, you can &lt;a href="https://gretathemes.com/optimize-wordpress-website-increase-conversions/" rel="follow"&gt;improve the conversion rate&lt;/a&gt;, sale, interaction, … and especially users’ experience. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For eCommerce websites: Customers can &lt;strong&gt;save their interested products&lt;/strong&gt;, then come back to search and buy them in the next shopping time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Readers can &lt;strong&gt;save posts / documents / novels / helpful contents&lt;/strong&gt;, then they can get back to the exact position they finished reading the last time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an eCommerce website using Favorite buttons (the heart-shaped), so that their users can add their preferred products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kZ3tgf2D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/4jX9UMY.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kZ3tgf2D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/4jX9UMY.gif" alt="an eCommerce website using Favorite buttons"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install Meta Box Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will add a favorite button on my blog sites (on single post pages). Once users read my blogs, they can click this button to save their favorite posts for the next reading time, if they find them helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have said before, I will use MB Favorite Posts solution of Meta Box. This solution is super easy to use, and I can work on it without configuring or coding. Besides, you also can quickly set up many options for the Favorite button on one and only Settings page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install and activate Meta Box plugin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5djM4kmy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/bBo6YV3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5djM4kmy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/bBo6YV3.png" alt="install and activate Meta Box plugin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, go to your &lt;a href="https://metabox.io/my-account/"&gt;My Account&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://metabox.io/"&gt;metabox.io&lt;/a&gt;, then download MB Favorite Posts solution. Upload the .zip file you have just downloaded to the website like you usually do to &lt;a href="https://gretathemes.com/install-wordpress-plugin/" rel="follow"&gt;install plugins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jCalsxo9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/d3XL2S0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jCalsxo9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/d3XL2S0.png" alt="Upload the .zip file of MB Favorite Posts solution"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After activating the solution, a favorite button will automatically appear on the posts of your website. You can randomly go to a post to check it out, and the favorite button will come to you like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H4ROEH04--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/8aCZVvb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H4ROEH04--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/8aCZVvb.png" alt="a favorite button shows up on the posts of your WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In default, this button is named as &lt;strong&gt;Add to Favorites&lt;/strong&gt;, and shown at the end of the content section. Of course, you can change its name, display position, and ask users to log in before using this button. Especially, you can add a page for users to sign up for a new account or see the list of their favorite posts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Set Up the Favorite Button&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up the Favorite button, go to &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Favorite Posts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rename&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this settings page, you just have to type the name of the button in the &lt;strong&gt;Button text&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Button Added Text&lt;/strong&gt; section, like in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PW17yjdr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/IHIgH4U.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PW17yjdr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/IHIgH4U.png" alt="type the name of the Favorite button"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Relocate the Favorite Button&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can freely choose where to display the favorite button as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To choose its location on a single post page, you just have to choose 1 of these 3 options in the &lt;strong&gt;Position&lt;/strong&gt; section on the setting page like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OPxxnLls--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/YjoiyX9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OPxxnLls--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/YjoiyX9.png" alt="choose where to display the button"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to display the Favorite button in the post of a certain post type, tick to choose that post type in the &lt;strong&gt;Post Types&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2JLjetjJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/zVJjzkB.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2JLjetjJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/zVJjzkB.png" alt="display the Favorite button in the post of a certain post type on the WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show the favorite button at other positions on single post pages or a random page, you can use this shortcode: &lt;code&gt;[mbfp-button]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have added my favorite button to the sidebar of the WordPress website by going to &lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Widgets&lt;/strong&gt;, adding a &lt;strong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt; widget to the &lt;strong&gt;Sidebar&lt;/strong&gt; then paste the shortcode there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cS9X90mr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/r7jSbkE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cS9X90mr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/r7jSbkE.png" alt="Use shortcode to add a favorite button to the sidebar of the WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u8f_kYqD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/iRJnEjB.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u8f_kYqD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/iRJnEjB.png" alt="the like button shows up on the sidebar of the WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ask Users to Log in to Use the Favorite Post Feature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing, the &lt;strong&gt;Enable for non-logged in users&lt;/strong&gt; feature will be enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mCqvPqY---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/1Sy8fbx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mCqvPqY---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/1Sy8fbx.png" alt="allow non-logged in users to use the Favorite Posts feature"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if users do not log in, their favorite post list will be &lt;strong&gt;temporarily saved in the cookie of the browser&lt;/strong&gt;, and will be lost when the cookie is deleted. After a period of time, or when users have deleted cookies, they cannot find out their favorite posts anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid these annoying cases, you had better allow users to create an account and save their favorite post list in their account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, untick the &lt;strong&gt;Enable for non-logged in users&lt;/strong&gt; option and then go to the &lt;strong&gt;Register Page&lt;/strong&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V4Oiu6kM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/tK61j2o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V4Oiu6kM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/tK61j2o.png" alt="Ask Users to Log in to Use the Favorite Post Feature"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have had a register page already and want to use it, just leave the &lt;strong&gt;Register Page&lt;/strong&gt; box blank. Then anyone logging in to their accounts with any roles can use the favorite button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve had a register page, you can create a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--asoSbuHv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/CfUeg5y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--asoSbuHv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/CfUeg5y.png" alt="create a blank page on the WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, in the &lt;strong&gt;Register Page&lt;/strong&gt; section, you will see the page you have just created in the dropdown list like in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2rS_MhBG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/OdePr11.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2rS_MhBG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/OdePr11.png" alt="create a Register page on the WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just have to choose the page you have created and click &lt;strong&gt;Save Settings&lt;/strong&gt;. MB Favorite Post will automatically add fields to this register page with a form like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CnUzT5m6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/xaG7xnE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CnUzT5m6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/xaG7xnE.png" alt="MB Favorite Post automatically add fields to the register page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use CSS to make this form more stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When users sign up for a new account on this page, their User Role is &lt;strong&gt;Subscriber&lt;/strong&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set Up Dashboard Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dashboard Page is a page where users review their list of favorite posts. You can choose a random page to turn into Dashboard Page. When users choose a post as favorite, it will be shown on this Dashboard Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I create a page as &lt;strong&gt;Favorite Posts&lt;/strong&gt; and choose it in the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard Page&lt;/strong&gt; section in the settings page of MB Favorite Posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pjyZcjWK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/eR1DdFL.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pjyZcjWK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/eR1DdFL.png" alt="Create a dashboard page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Even when you choose to allow non-logged in users to use this feature, you still have to choose the Dashboard page as a certain page, so that users have a place to see their favorite post list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need to display your &lt;strong&gt;Favorite Posts&lt;/strong&gt; page on your website to help users access it easily. I will set it on my menu as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--25LtXqwY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/ED6Bi4u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--25LtXqwY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/ED6Bi4u.png" alt="display your Favorite Posts page on the WordPress website"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going to the &lt;strong&gt;Favorite Posts&lt;/strong&gt; page, you will see a list of favorite posts display like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7T26m13--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/05xS8q7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7T26m13--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/05xS8q7.png" alt="a list of liked posts on the dashboard page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this last article in which I promised to do on the theme The Power of Production Linux , we arrived at part 3 (final). But to end with great style, I come with a very interesting subject: The Fish Shell, The Interactive and Productive Terminal linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being very productive, the Fish Shell is implemented with bash and zhs, intelligent and very easy to use. So if you want to make your command line more productive, more useful and more fun, without the need to learn various mysterious syntax and configuration options. Fish is the ideal tool.&lt;/p&gt;
