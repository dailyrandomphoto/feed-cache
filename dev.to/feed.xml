      <title>How much revenue do you generate?</title>
      <author>Sandor Dargo</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 10:54:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sandordargo/how-much-revenue-do-you-generate-49gg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sandordargo/how-much-revenue-do-you-generate-49gg</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"... and gentlemen, these results are not just extraordinary because we - in this department - have experienced unprecedented growth in our corporation, but we have also achieved these results with a quite small team. The revenue per person for each of us here is unique in BestCompanyEver" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;said Lance while celebrating the results of an - indeed - successful backlog reduction program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generating-more-money-higher-salary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generating more money != higher salary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would have probably continued his speech if someone hadn't interrupted him with that well-known question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But do I see another dime?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgg9byUy-V4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That clearly stopped him. His boss - whose further and well-merited promotion was announced the very same day a few hours earlier - took on and he said that's indeed a challenge to solve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real challenge, because in a grown-up corporation, even if some of the departments work in a start-up mode, it's really difficult to value some teams' contributions differently than others', not just because of the internal HR processes, but also because then everyone would want to move to better-paid areas within the same enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above-mentioned interruption didn't even aim to point out the need for changing how people are rewarded. The big boss was right, it's probably impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, there was another reason behind it. Emphasizing the importance of the revenue we - business analysts, designers, developers, line managers, testers, etc. - always feels bizarre in my opinion if it's meant to motivate the teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sharing why let me tell you when it's OK or even good. If it's a small company where bringing in (more) revenue is still a matter of life or death of the company. If you are in a bigger enterprise with financial difficulties these are valid points to make. If after unprofitable quarters you finally nail it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But within a corporation where there are thousands of people working and every quarter the financial statement is better than the previous one was, this will not motivate people. Reminding the plebs that their work keeps the company moving is okay, but don't try to amaze and inspire with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that in most publicly traded corporations the first people to satisfy are the shareholders. The more money the company makes, the higher the share prices and dividends go in the long run. I know, I'm not going to be nominated for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do the small ants who make the company thrive get another dime once the shareholders are happy? Barely, that's the truth according to my experience. It is not at all represented in their base salaries, sometimes they might receive a slightly bigger bonus, but even that is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little ants are the last ones who get paid when things go well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, they are the first ones when it comes to cost reductions. Lowering bonuses, cutting conference budgets, cancelling employee-family events, removing team events or even breakfasts will come as first just to reach some targeted quarterly numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as employees are ~mature~ adults, there will always be an explanation. Oh, sorry. No. Not even that. Most probably you will just realize that the event is removed from your calendar until further notice. Oops. There will be no further notice ever. If you bring it up, oh you know, what you have to listen to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, whatever is taken away is taken for good, even in case the team brings so huge revenues per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loss-aversion-vs-risk-aversion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loss aversion vs risk aversion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might argue that increasing revenue is in your interest because upper management might take away fewer benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is it motivating to work so that you don't lose something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201803/what-is-loss-aversion"&gt;Yes, it is!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone tells you to do something, otherwise you lose 10 quids, you will feel much more motivated compared to if you were promised 10 extra bucks for doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Humans may be hardwired to be loss averse due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains: for an organism operating close to the edge of survival, the loss of a day's food could cause death, whereas the gain of an extra day's food would not cause an extra day of life (unless the food could be easily and effectively stored)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But will this loss aversion really motivate a developer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the answer is yes. But, as a manager, you have to explain what this extra revenue helps to keep or get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explain-the-contribution-you-bring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explain the contribution you bring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans, especially men are bad at reading minds. If I only hear the increased revenue I generated, I won't feel motivated or even proud by the extra money our shareholders will get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please explain better. Tell me that I will still enjoy Fruity Fridays or I will get a 78.68 Euros bigger yearly bonus and I might cheer with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's look at things from a different angle. "Our workers are not motivated by their salaries, but by the products they can work on, by their belonging to this family and by the new fancy technologies they can use here" - those, by the way, will be outdated 2 days before the day after tomorrow. Oh, we all heard this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine, let's assume that I accept that I'm not primarily motivated by my salary. But if I'm not supposed to be sparked up by my salary why am I supposed to applaud for what the shareholders make?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, both the salary and the company's revenues are important. For most, it's essential to make a good living and the company revenues are critical in order to get paid. But honestly, the ability to pay the wages is probably not something you should motivate people with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you emphasize the quality of our products, the value we bring to our customers, the lives we help to save, the dreams we help to achieve, you're a better communicator and motivator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an employee, I might care more about those things. Maybe I can directly relate my work to little Liza avoiding an accident due to our emergency brake system, or hiker Harry making it all the way down to Tierra Fuego. They might make me proud of my work. Mister Teller checking the increasing share prices and dividends will not motivate me at all, he will not make me happy or proud at all - and I'm really far from being a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, hearing about the increasing incomes that never reach me, it makes me wonder what the hell I'm doing here. Should I go to a startup where I'm financially incentivized to make the product thrive? Should I convert to a type of consultant who is not paid by the hour but by the delivered results or just simply create my own business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all the questions that are popping into my mind when I see managers speaking about ever-increasing revenues (per capita!) with their shining eyes. Even if I like to work for them, for the team, for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would heartily advise managers to follow some basic rules of public speaking and choose their words based on the audience. Motivate stakeholders with business numbers and individual contributors with the value we provide to the customers, with the quality of our work, with the decreasing pressure and increasing confidence of our business colleagues. With the things that actually have a direct impact on our life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the GRANDstack?</title>
      <author>Tomek Poniatowicz</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 10:20:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tomekponiat/what-is-the-grandstack-3afn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tomekponiat/what-is-the-grandstack-3afn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time we looked a bit at neo4j and the benefits of using it together with GraphQL and I briefly mentioned a little thing called the GRAND stack and promised to get more into its details later. So this time let's go deeper and check out what using not two but four technologies together can do for us. The GRAND stack is a full-stack framework for making GraphQL apps, a combination of four technologies which make up the acronym:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;raphQL, &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eact, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;pollo and &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;eo4j &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;atabase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those curious, yes you can substitute React for another framework like Vue or Angular if that’s your preference, but that would make it a GVAND or GAAND stack which isn't nearly as catchy so bear that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#g-for-graphql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  G for GraphQL
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re here you probably know a bit about GraphQL already so let’s get to why GraphQL is used here. Its Schema Definition Language is language agnostic which makes it perspect for interacting with other technologies (like the ones in the stack) and more importantly its namesake graph aspect plays really well into the fact neo4j is a graph database and that means its graphs all the way down from start to finish. To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data layer agnostic, GraphQL can be used with any data source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no under or overfetching, querying with GraphQL gets you exactly and only the data you asked for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;graphs all the way down, all data is handled as a graph and since its data source agnostic you can use this to integrate data from different sources in a transparent and organized way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; introspection, you can ask a GraphQL API for the queries it supports which makes creating documentation a lot easier if not automatic with certain tools like SpectaQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6fICLcht--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kh9naglfszz1e2fq1he4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6fICLcht--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kh9naglfszz1e2fq1he4.png" alt="GraphQL vs REST"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#r-for-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  R for React
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is a component based JavaScript library used for creating User Interfaces. Here it is used for the frontend and handles requests and responses via the Apollo Client React integration, sending them to and receiving them from the GraphQL server. Since React uses components for data handling and UI purposes you can use some component library to get a bunch of popular and ready to use components instead of creating them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nOFODMZl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2rff72pwxqnnpy4b166.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nOFODMZl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2rff72pwxqnnpy4b166.png" alt="ReactJS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-reactjsorg"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Source: &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;reactjs.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-for-apollo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A for Apollo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apollo is a powerful tool which basically focuses on making using GraphQL easier on the side of the client and the server. Apollo Client is a client-side JavaScript library for querying the GraphQL API from the app, it handles interactions with the React frontend. Apollo Server provides a GraphQL Server and is used for the backend handling HTTP requests and responses, the GraphQL operation and schema and all the data. Despite its many shortcomings, Apollo still seems to be the most popular GraphQL client.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_NHVdO9u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rli9ercqwm7uraa6hhfd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_NHVdO9u--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rli9ercqwm7uraa6hhfd.png" alt="Apollo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Source: &lt;a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/introducing-the-apollo-graphql-platform-8ef34bb269e5/"&gt;apollographql.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nd-for-neo4j-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ND for Neo4j Database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neo4j is the key fit here because it's a graph database so it's made specifically for handling graph data and complex graph traversals which is exactly what we have with GraphQL and its queries. This also means we’re able to maintain the same data model throughout the entire stack. Now if you’ve read my last piece about Neo4j you’re probably thinking about having to learn Cypher. The good news is you don't have to do it straight away thanks to the neo4j-graphql.js package. It handles building basic mutations for you and it also solves the n+1 query problem as well by translating GraphQL queries to a single Cypher query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QoNn_Ze5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jycrfoulbtiwrr4u2ocm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QoNn_Ze5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jycrfoulbtiwrr4u2ocm.png" alt="Neo4j Database"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-neo4jcom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Source: &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/"&gt;neo4j.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-all-roses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not all roses
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could say it's called grand for a reason as you will have to learn Cypher to fully grasp the GRAND stack and that can take a while, especially if you haven't dealt with it before. It is a lot of work and that can be a turnoff, but if you do it's probably worth it just for the neo4j graph database, never mind the whole stack so if you’re already working with GraphQL that could be a nice goal to set for yourself. If not, even without it, it does offer you quite a bit and is probably worth checking out to see if you want to invest your time and work into learning it. If you want to learn more about it make sure to check &lt;a href="https://grandstack.io/docs/getting-started-neo4j-graphql"&gt;the GRANDstack official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting the Transcription of a Video From Youtube using google cloud platform.</title>
      <author>computer_geek77</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 10:02:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/computergeek/getting-the-transcription-of-a-video-from-youtube-using-google-cloud-platform-19ed</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/computergeek/getting-the-transcription-of-a-video-from-youtube-using-google-cloud-platform-19ed</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, the other day I was searching for python code that gives me a transcript of any video, I did what all we do I searched everywhere on Internet but was unfortunate. But we are programmers best thing we do is search more on the internet. finally, I got the code I wanted, all thanks to &lt;br&gt;
Pragnakalp Techlabs&lt;br&gt;
. Although the code was a little different from my expectations I did some filters on it and made it to view the transcripts of the youtube video.&lt;br&gt;
Be patient there are going to be few steps involved in our process !!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pip install google-api-python-client
# pip install youtube_transcript_api

from apiclient.discovery import build
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

api_key = "Secret Key"  # replace it with your API key
video_id = str(input("Enter the video id: "))  # replace it with your channel id
youtube = build('youtube', 'v3',developerKey=api_key)

try:
        responses = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(
            video_id, languages=['en'])
        print('\n'+"Video: "+"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" +
              str(video_id)+'\n'+'\n'+"Captions:")
        for response in responses:
            text = response['text']
            print(text)
except Exception as e:
        print(e)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For full tutorial how to get the API key and all that thing you can check out my medium article on this 👇👇👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpsmediumcomcomputergeekgettingthetranscriptionofavideofromyoutubeusinggooglecloudplatform3c862d1276a5"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@computer_geek/getting-the-transcription-of-a-video-from-youtube-using-google-cloud-platform-3c862d1276a5"&gt;https://medium.com/@computer_geek/getting-the-transcription-of-a-video-from-youtube-using-google-cloud-platform-3c862d1276a5&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I am finding it little difficult to write code and syntax highlighting and inserting images on dev platform, but the code may not look very attractive but that works fine for any video on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should you build a Slack bot? Building one saved our future sprints</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/infobipdev/should-you-build-a-slack-bot-building-one-saved-our-future-sprints-4l80</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to improve or automate a process in your team or organization? Slack bots could be an easy and quick way to do it.&lt;br&gt;
Let me tell you how my team at Infobip built an internal Slack bot, how to build your own using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Slack bolt, how to integrate it into your workspace, as well as how to deploy it on Azure Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-bottleneck-to%C2%A0bot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From Bottleneck to Bot
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team uses 2-week sprints, and each task gets code reviewed by at least one person from our team. The code review process turned out to be a bottleneck. We didn't have an explicit way of determining the code reviewer for our tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our original idea was that anyone who has free time will check out the Jira code review column and review some tasks. When that approach didn't work, we agreed among ourselves on who will review which task. However, we chose the person we were closest to, leading to inequality in the workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to find - and needed - a solution that included making the code review Jira column no longer a bottleneck for us while focusing on making the number of code reviewers equal per sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about building a Slack bot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can build it to display the name of the person who will code review the task. The bot would select a person using the round-robin arrangement. Another idea was to create a special application for that, but this was a simpler approach because we already use Slack for our internal communication and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#our-code-review-picker%C2%A0bot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Our Code Review Picker Bot
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it, we would send a slack message in our private channel to the bot. It would respond with the name of your code reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it takes to add the app to your private Slack channel is to use the „Add apps to this channel" command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used Node.js along with Slack bolt framework and PostgreSQL for data storage. I picked Azure for deployment because at Infobip, each of us has a personal monthly budget for the platform. Azure Cloud was overwhelming at first because of the many options it offers. But it soon became one of my favorite deployment platforms because it's easy to understand and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-slack-app-easy-and%C2%A0fun"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a Slack App? Easy and Fun
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to create the Slack app was easy and fun because of detailed Slack documentation. Slack has many tutorials on how to get your bot up and running, which you can check out here: &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-js"&gt;https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an app, visit the apps page on Slack: &lt;a href="https://api.slack.com/apps"&gt;https://api.slack.com/apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UWldYVIj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tmpriwv1wds8d8pezew.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UWldYVIj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tmpriwv1wds8d8pezew.png" alt="Create a Slack app"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Basic Information tab and save the Singing secret from your App Credentials. Install the app to your workspace to get the OAuth token. After that, go to OAuth &amp;amp; Permissions screen and save the Bot User OAuth Token. On the Bot Token Scopes page, select the scopes you need. I've selected the chat:write and users:read scopes to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating the Slack app, go to portal.azure.com and create a new App Service. I've picked Node as the Runtime stack and Windows OS. After you create the service, save the Slack token and Slack bot token as environment variables in the Configuration tab on the Settings slots of your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the Deployment Center on the Azure Portal and pick the deployment option that best suits you. I went with the Local Git option. Clone the repository and initialize your project using the npm init command. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the @slack/bolt package: npm i @slack/bolt. Push the code to deploy the changes:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Go back to the Slack API bot setup and visit the Event Subscriptions page to enable events. I've subscribed my bot to the message.groups event to receive an event payload whenever a new message is posted in a private channel to which the bot is added. After turning on the toggle switch to enable events, enter your Request URL which is available on the Overview page on the Azure portal. It should look like &lt;a href="https://azure-app-url/slack/events"&gt;https://azure-app-url/slack/events&lt;/a&gt;. If you see a green check mark after entering the URL you are all set and you can subscribe your bot to the events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After subscribing to events, I've used the message function to attach a listener to messages that contain the word review.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I stored the information about the code reviewers and registered channels in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure using Sequelize as an ORM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For debugging the application, visit the Monitoring slot on the Azure portal, and on the App Service logs tab turn on Application Logging to connect to the Log stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's best to first create a test private channel to test the bot and try out all options that the Slack bolt framework offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it. Have fun building your bot. Once we started using the Slack bot in our Infobip team, the code review was no longer a bottleneck inside the sprint and after a while, we completely forgot that it used to be a problem for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#another-example-metrics-for-human%C2%A0emotions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Another Example: Metrics For Human Emotions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use case for which we used a Slack bot is to collect mood data within the team. Working from home made it challenging for us to check up on each other. We heard of the Niko-Niko agile method, which is a simple calendar where everyone states their mood daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone can express their mood as good, bad or neutral. The Slack bot sends a message each day to our private channel and saves our mood to the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also make a useful checkup on 1 on 1 meetings with your manager on things that can improve. Everyone should feel safe to express their mood honestly and be aware that their manager is there to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is represented for each team per month. You can track the mood board calendar showing each person's mood for the day and charts per team or an individual showing the trend and the summary. I developed it using .Net with Blazor and Chart.js extension for Blazor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ilIxipU9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vkchwkt2tfj2y61ks8ed.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ilIxipU9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vkchwkt2tfj2y61ks8ed.jpg" alt="Mood metrics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@takeshi2?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;wu yi&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/keyboard-emoji?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you tried using a Slack bot to improve some of your team or organization processes? I would love to hear your ideas and thoughts about Slack bot implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
1 GETTING STARTED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, you’ll run your first Python program, hello_world.py. First, you’ll need to check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your computer; if it isn’t, you’ll install it. You’ll also install a text editor to work with your Python programs. Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections as you write, making it easy to understand your code’s structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Setting Up Your Programming Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python differs slightly on different operating systems, so you’ll need to keep a few considerations in mind. In the following sections, we’ll make sure Python is set up correctly on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Python Versions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every programming language evolves as new ideas and technologies emerge, and the developers of Python have continually made the language…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Tips to consider when styling with CSS</title>
      <author>Posandu Mapa</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:49:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/posandu/tips-to-consider-when-styling-with-css-45kf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/posandu/tips-to-consider-when-styling-with-css-45kf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will tell you some tips to consider when styling with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reset-the-css-layout-before-styling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reset the CSS layout before styling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must reset the whole layout of the page using this four lines of code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;alternatively, you can use&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inherit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visit-dribbble-to-get-some-inspiration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Visit Dribbble to get some inspiration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a site called Dribbble where you can find lots of inspiration to style a page or an HTML element. visit this site by clicking the below link &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/"&gt;dribbble.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Below is an example where you can get inspiration to style a button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TzbZnq3j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8w4rgod3hvp525fjeabj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TzbZnq3j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8w4rgod3hvp525fjeabj.png" alt="Add to cart by Aaron Iker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/8553598-Add-to-cart"&gt;Add to cart by Aaron Iker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-css-variables-for-colors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use CSS variables for colors
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing is you can use CSS variables. By Using them you can change the colors of the whole by changing one line of CSS code. See the example below where CSS variables are used.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="py"&gt;--blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="py"&gt;--red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.blue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;--blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;--red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See the example below. (code)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/async-frost-vwe27"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#think-about-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Think about accessibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must design UIs accessibility friendly. See the sandbox below and try to navigate using the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#without-any-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Without any accessibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/quirky-lovelace-qzkc2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#with-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  With accessibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/happy-faraday-k9c9y"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can see why accessibility is important for the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-a-good-font"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use a good font
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font also shows your brand. Messing up the font is messing up your brand. There are lots of fonts available. Here are the most popular fonts to use in your UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#roboto"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Roboto
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wx_ORdR9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/toow5bzsfgoqqjzh8h4d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wx_ORdR9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/toow5bzsfgoqqjzh8h4d.png" alt="Roboto font"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#noto-sans-jp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Noto Sans JP
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OjZD32Pu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o9ksgmhrcy58r5s90wvt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OjZD32Pu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o9ksgmhrcy58r5s90wvt.png" alt="Noto Sans JP"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lato"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lato
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fHYzL8SJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ftsmjxll4sb6o0f4g0j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fHYzL8SJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ftsmjxll4sb6o0f4g0j.png" alt="SLato"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  COVID-19 Changed the world...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the year 2020 world is different. The majority of people change the way of workflow from Office to Remote mode.&lt;br&gt;
We are required to use different enterprise applications to create communication between each other.&lt;br&gt;
Each of them has its own advantages, but in most cases, you have to register or download the application to use it.&lt;br&gt;
Besides, you have to pay for "Premium" accounts sometimes if you want to have extra options.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, in some countries, you can not use that popular software, because they have been blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-this-is-the-time-when-fast-connect-comes-around"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So this is the time when Fast Connect comes around...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using our application you &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT NEED&lt;/strong&gt; to download anything to your device or pay for anything.&lt;br&gt;
You can create a new conference and use all features for &lt;strong&gt;ABSOLUTELY FREE&lt;/strong&gt; and without registration ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is to take 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a unique ID for the conference, send it to all your colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter that ID on the homepage and start your conference. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/huseyn0w/"&gt;My Linkedin profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No registration and NO "PREMIUM" accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime video/audio conference with unlimited number of users&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Migrating to Cypress, a journey</title>
      <author>Laís Tomaz</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:28:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/coolblue/migrating-to-cypress-a-journey-52j9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/coolblue/migrating-to-cypress-a-journey-52j9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago, we finished a one-year-long journey of moving away from Codeception and adopting &lt;a href="https://www.cypress.io/"&gt;Cypress&lt;/a&gt; as our tool to develop acceptance tests for Coolblue’s webshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back as the person that led this process, I thought of this whole effort as &lt;em&gt;“I only did my job”&lt;/em&gt;, but a deeper look and a conversation with colleagues reminded me that it was actually quite the challenge, and it motivated me to share what I learned during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re investigating adopting Cypress, I hope this blog helps you figure out the best way for your migration process. Enough introductions, let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-things-first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First things first
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, Cypress is a great tool, I’ve been using it since its Test Runner got released as an open source tool, mainly for smaller projects and with great results, but that does not mean it’s the right fit for your project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated with how difficult it was to test our scenarios with Codeception, every time writing acceptance tests were mentioned during refinements a lot of extra points were added to a story and that just sat wrong with me, writing tests shouldn’t feel like a burden. That’s why I spent my learning blocks trying out how to make Cypress work for our webshop and first find solutions to fit how we handle different environments, countries and languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first step was very important, I was able to find out how different it would be from my previous experiences using Cypress and gave me the space to find answers for our specific needs. Still, it wasn’t a 100% fit and half into the migration we had to deal with not yet supported features like SSO integration in different ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My advice is to check and make sure Cypress fits your needs first, or that you can find a workaround for these cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-everyone-on-board"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get everyone on board
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where I made my first mistake. Without previous discussions outside my team, I opened a big PR implementing Cypress to test a new feature and fairly, I received some very worried comments. This was never a one-person job and having everyone agree with the adoption of the tool first should have been my second step, so there I went: I collected data, arguments and went to our back-end and front-end meetings to get people on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment you’ll hear some very reasonable questions, so listen carefully. Take your time to research and answer them. Getting input from my colleagues was absolutely important for the success of this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They will be the ones creating new tests and maintaining existing ones, and getting people excited by the possibilities the new tool brings is as important as a perfect PR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#measure-measure-and-measure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Measure, measure and measure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s only a webshop, right? Catalog, product page, cart and checkout. How hard could it be?&lt;br&gt;
Well, we actually have multiple teams taking care of every page of the user experience in our webshop, which at that time meant more than 400 scenarios being tested and different people being responsible for writing and maintaining these tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a detailed list of scenarios was fundamental, it gave us a rough estimation of the size of the challenge, and it helped us to keep track of the progress of our migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The takeaway here is: make sure you have an overview of what lies ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-it-go"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let it go ❄️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some development principles are beyond frameworks and languages, some are not. The limitations of previous testing tools had led us to create some patterns, like only having one assertion per test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example could have been valid previously, but how is this applicable for a test that is supposed to mimic a user behavior? Your user won’t load the page, click a button and reload again to interact with another feature, they also won’t wait 10 full seconds after a click for a modal to be open, so neither should your test, especially when having tools like Cypress with great error handling that will tell you exactly where the error lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to increase the adoption of the tool and the speed of the migration I added an extension to our Cypress implementation to allow for the usage of Gherkin to write the tests and at some point it only got in our way to make the best of Cypress performance and what the tool could provide, so we had to rewrite a good part of the scenarios for a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-the-compass-in-hand"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep the compass in hand
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this moment to not blindly convert every scenario to a Cypress acceptance test. Acceptance tests are costly and intrinsically flaky, therefore &lt;strong&gt;challenge people into asking if that scenario could have been covered by a unit or an integration test&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cypress can easily be bloated with different types of testing, but in our case it was important to keep our goal in mind: making testing easier, decreasing the flakiness, and improving our day-to-day speed of delivery. Having that as our north guided lots of conversations into a common understanding and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#draw-a-map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Draw a map
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cypress documentation is one of those easy to read and follow. Fairly enough, some developers will only be interested in updating existing scenarios, and they will bring assumptions on how to write tests from previous experiences with different tools that in some cases won’t fit your new way of handling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strive for making the adoption easier by developing custom commands if needed and writing a straight to the point documentation of what matters for your application.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-swimming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep swimming
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, it took us a year to complete the entire migration, and this is not to point fingers. We have stakeholders with new ideas to be implemented and so much time for task forces and contributing with the adoption of a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing in some shiny new technology into a company doesn’t stop when the PR is merged, a good part of the job is to make time to give support to people that might be struggling with adopting it and to keep pushing people to make time for it, reminding them of the benefits of when we cross the line. Trust me, the trouble is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enjoy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enjoy 💃
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, when it’s all done, celebrate! This is web development, it won’t be too long until the next journey starts again ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing analyzer problems in multi-targeted Umbraco packages</title>
      <author>Matt Brailsford</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 08:45:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mattbrailsford/fixing-analyzer-problems-in-multi-targeted-umbraco-packages-3ijk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mattbrailsford/fixing-analyzer-problems-in-multi-targeted-umbraco-packages-3ijk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you may know, I've recently been working on getting &lt;a href="https://vendr.net"&gt;Vendr&lt;/a&gt; ready for Umbraco v9 which is based on .NET Core. As we &lt;a href="https://vendr.net/blog/getting-vendr-net-core-ready/"&gt;blogged about&lt;/a&gt;, because we need to continue to support v8 users of Umbraco we took the decision to do a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file"&gt;multi-targeted approach&lt;/a&gt; whereby we would have a single package that contains DLL's compiled for both .NET Framework (v8) and .NET Core (v9) and have the correct ones be used depending on the project it is installed into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst most of the setup for multi-targeting worked as expected, there was one weird bug that we couldn't quite figure out. We managed to find a hacky way around it, and just moved on, but as more Umbraco package devs are starting to make the move to .NET Core, and some of those are also looking at multi targeted approaches, I'm seeing those devs hit the exact same problem too, so I thought I'd look into more and see if there is proper fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I was witnessing was that my projects that had an Umbraco dependency would also inherit a dependency on Lucene.NET. For the .NET Framework target this would be Lucene.NET v3 and for the .NET Core target this would be Lucene.NET v4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue was, that the v4 build of Lucene.NET contained some code analyzers which the v3 build didn't have, however the SDK project implementation, which automatically includes analyzers into your project, would assume that if one build had the analyzers, then both builds must have them, and so analyzers would appear in both analyzers collections for both targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xqBs_NSn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rg2p2gk2i3kt38y8pvq5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xqBs_NSn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rg2p2gk2i3kt38y8pvq5.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately though, because the v3 build didn't actually have any of them, when you'd come to build the project, you would get build errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZxYnxEKV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tifnnot6r34iaql6flv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZxYnxEKV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tifnnot6r34iaql6flv.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#original-hacky-workaround"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Original Hacky Workaround
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some investigation and tried a number of things to try and make this work initially, but nothing I did seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I could get to work, and what many of the other Umrbaco package devs started doing was to copy the analyzers DLLs from the v4 nuget package folder to the v3 folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked, and prevented the build errors, but it wasn't ideal. Especially if you have a build server build your packages as I ended up having to put some code in my build script to auto copy the analyzers after nuget package restore which was really pretty ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reporting-the-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reporting The Issue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was originally reluctant to report this issue as I couldn't really narrow down what was at fault. Was it Visual Studio? or was it .NET?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussions with others, we came to the conclusion it must be .NET at fault so I went and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/6500"&gt;reported the issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/6500"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w5R2PuVi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n8l23dhchzug079893qu.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we were correct that it was .NET Core, or more specifically, the SDK project implementation that was at fault, and there was already a fix coming in .NET 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-better-workaround"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Better Workaround
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing from the issue tracker though was a suggested interim workaround which was much less hacky than the approach I had previously been doing and was a simple case of updating your proj file with the following snippet to remove the offending analyzer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Workaround for this bug (replace the analyzer name with the one you need to exclude (filename only, no extension) --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"RemoveLuceneAnalyzer"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;BeforeTargets=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"CoreCompile"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ItemGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Analyzer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Remove=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"@(Analyzer)"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"%(FileName) == 'Lucene.Net.CodeAnalysis.CSharp'"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ItemGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, this worked great and is now the approach I'm using in all my affected projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this won't be needed when .NET 6 gets released, but we at least have a decent workaround in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps other Umbraco package devs who also hit the same problem whilst multi-targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Array.reduce
&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does reduce do? Why is it so powerful?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here's the technical definition of reduce...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.reduce()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not very helpful if you ask me, so LET'S LEARN BY DOING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-find-total-of-all-numbers-summed-using-reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Find total of all numbers summed (using reduce)
&lt;/h3&gt;






&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// loop 1: 0 + 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// loop 2: 3 + 2.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// loop 3: 5.1 + 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// loop 4: 10.1 + 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns 18.1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-find-total-of-all-numbers-multiplied"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Find total of all numbers multiplied
&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As shown, it's pretty easy to add or multiply all of the numbers in an array. But, c'mon - I said reduce is THE MOST POWERFUL FUNCTION IN ALL OF JS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obviously, there has to be more to reduce - right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;60&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say we want to get &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, more specifically, we want to &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; the values and only return the values if they are less than 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, we can simply use the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; function and only return the numbers if they are less than 10.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-arrayfilter-using-reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Array.Filter using reduce
&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, with reduce - we can do the exact same thing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And lala, we replaced filter with reduce - pretty cool but let's be honest. This STILL DOESN'T justify &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; as being &lt;strong&gt;THE MOST POWERFUL FUNCTION IN ALL OF JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I told you, we could continue down this path and replace just about every array function in JavaScript using reduce?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-recreating-raw-arraysome-endraw-using-raw-arrayreduce-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Re-creating &lt;code&gt;Array.some&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns true (We have some numbers in the array are less than 50)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using reduce, we simply set the initial value to false. If the condition is already true then we return the condition. If the condition is not already true then we check if the current number meets our condition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;  
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice, this time we start with a bool (false) as our initial value instead of using a number or an array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have now summed, multiplied, filtered, and re-created some (aka conditionally checking something on our array using reduce).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We could go on to also replace the &lt;code&gt;Array.every&lt;/code&gt; function using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;, but since that is similar to replacing &lt;code&gt;Array.some&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt; we'll just note that we can easily do that as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. What about &lt;code&gt;Array.join&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;Array.join&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;truck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "truck-car-people"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt; we can code the following&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;truck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "-truck-car-people"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice the output has a preceding dash at the front.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The callback function accepted as the first argument for the &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt; function accepts more parameters. We can use the third accepted parameters to track our &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; for our reduce function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;truck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; 
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "truck-car-people"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With that 3rd parameter set up, this reduce function will now act exactly how the original &lt;code&gt;Array.join&lt;/code&gt; acts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that, so far we have used reduce to replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array.map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array.filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array.every, Array.some&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array.join&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  5. Array.concat using Reduce
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about concat? Where you can concat an array of "1", "2", and "3" with another array?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [1, 2, 3, 'hey', 'world', 'mars']&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How would you concat or combine arrays reduce?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [1, 2, 3, 'hey, 'world', 'mars']&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What's cool about combining arrays using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt; is that we can "concat" as many arrays as we want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simply, by passing in more arrays we will automatically combine aka concatenate them using reduce.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With that, we have replicated &lt;code&gt;Array.concat&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's get into a few more examples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, let's create a few people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sarah@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tim@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;len@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-grouping-people-by-names-using-raw-arrayreduce-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Grouping People By Names using &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of what we want when we group people by names&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Gets Len&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { name: 'len', email: 'len@gmail.com', id: 3 }&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Gets sarah&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { name: 'sarah', email: 'sarah@gmail.com', id: 1}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grouping people by their names using reduce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the initial value for our reduce function an object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build an object where 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key is the person's name ([person.name]) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value is the person object ([person.name]: person)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example (That won't work)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the example above we'll get an error&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whenever we use a short hand function to return an object we need to wrap it in parentheses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrap the returned object's brackets in parentheses to fix the error
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And lala, we now have a people object where the people are grouped by their name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we go &lt;code&gt;people.len&lt;/code&gt; we get len&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { name: 'len', email: 'len@gmail.com', id: 3 }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we go &lt;code&gt;people.sarah&lt;/code&gt; we get sarah&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { name: 'sarah', email: 'sarah@gmail.com', id: 1 }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we go &lt;code&gt;people.tim&lt;/code&gt; we get tim&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// { name: 'tim', email: 'tim@gmail.com', id: 2 }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we want all of our &lt;code&gt;people&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// people &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sarah@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tim@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;len@gmail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sub_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sub_two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sub_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nested_sub_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nested_sub_two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; 
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nested_sub_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nested_sub_four&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's take our list of arrays, and lets of course use reduce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list_of_arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nested_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nested_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And lala, we've flattened our list of multiple level nested arrays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sub_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sub_two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sub_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nested_sub_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nested_sub_two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nested_sub_three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nested_sub_four&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We only handled nested sub arrays up to 3 levels deep, but you could of course spend some more time on the function and use recursion to pretty simply flatten an array infinite nested levels deep using reduce.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-powerful-use-cases-for-reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More POWERFUL use cases for Reduce
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright, so now let's dive into some of the more Powerful, not as oftenly used - use cases for &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-apply-formatters-on-strings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Apply Formatters on Strings
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I'm going to start off with an array of strings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cool-link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello world of javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;goodbye, its been swell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next let's create an array of &lt;code&gt;formatters&lt;/code&gt;. Normally, I'd call these filters - but they're not really filters. They're just formatting the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These formatters are actually going to be callback functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we'll create a dashes to spaces formatter (replace dashes with spaces). Will use regex to implement this formatter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dashesToSpaces&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/-/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, we'll create a capitalize string formatter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;capitalize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, we'll create a string limiter formatter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the string is greater than a given length, replace the characters after that length limit with three dots.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limiter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;...`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll create a &lt;code&gt;formatters&lt;/code&gt; array with all of our string formatters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;formatters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dashesToSpaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;capitalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Remember we have our array of strings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cool-link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello world of javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;goodbye, its been swell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Goal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our goal is to apply every single formatter from our formatters array onto every single string from our strings array.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using reduce, we can simply do this like so!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;formatters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_And just like that, we used reduce to apply an array of formatters on an array of strings. _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Strings Array&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cool-link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello world of javascript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;goodbye, its been swell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output (After using reduce to apply string formatters)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Goodbye, i...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello worl...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Cool link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-group-students-by-rooms-using-reduce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Group students by rooms (using reduce)
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First let's create some students&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;students&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Sally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to group the students by their room&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we're going to do is use &lt;code&gt;students.reduce&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;class_rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice we use the parentheses around the object we're implicitly returning again. When we use a short hand function to return an object we have to use &lt;code&gt;({})&lt;/code&gt; syntax - if we attempt to directly return an object without the wrapping &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; we'll get an error. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we want to use the student room as the key:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;students&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;student&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, we have our students grouped by their rooms/classes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}],&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;nick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sarah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}],&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have successfully grouped our students by their rooms - so that is how we group by reduce. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So guys, that's about all I've got with reduce. I guess the biggest takeaway is that reduce is a super method - it really is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do just about anything you can do with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; other Array method using reduce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going &lt;code&gt;Array.filter.map.filter.forEach&lt;/code&gt;, you could use a single reduce function to accomplish the same goal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to group a whole bunch of object by their keys, use reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to pluck the values related to a given key? Use reduce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to apply multiple filters but don't want to raise the time complexity by iterating multiple times over through the same array - use reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to flatten an array of nested arrays where each nested array may have more nested array while each nested array also may not have any nested arrays? Use reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to sum some number, multiply some numbers, subtract sum numbers, or do some arithmetic of any sort - reduce works again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you need to combine some arrays? Use reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you need to combine some objects? Use reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you want to have a method in your back pocket that you know can do it all and just makes you feel more powerful and efficient as a software engineer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use reduce!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, forEach is the most over rated method in the JavaScript eco-system and reduce is the &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; under rated method in the JS eco-system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a final example of how cool reduce is let's take this final example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Clean Code Studio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;belief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Simplify!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;should_follow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Si, senor!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;last_example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; 
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;last_example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does this return? It merges all of the objects.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Clean Code Studio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;belief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Simplify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;should_follow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Si, senor!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="ltag__user ltag__user__id__386677"&gt;
  
    .ltag__user__id__386677 .follow-action-button {
      background-color: #339d15 !important;
      color: #ffffff !important;
      border-color: #339d15 !important;
    }
  
    &lt;a href="/cleancodestudio" class="ltag__user__link profile-image-link"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__user__pic"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iaD-SiIM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uL9Viyw2--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/386677/50ab5359-8342-4fc0-961a-04bb95957fa1.jpg" alt="cleancodestudio image"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag__user__content"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a class="ltag__user__link" href="/cleancodestudio"&gt;Clean Code Studio&lt;/a&gt;Follow
&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__user__summary"&gt;
      &lt;a class="ltag__user__link" href="/cleancodestudio"&gt;Clean Code StudioClean Code Clean Life ~ Simplify&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using reduce you can filter, you can apply, you can apply a list of callbacks, you can flatten, merge, combine...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend that you become familiar, competent, and over all familiar when it comes to using reduce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, using reduce you have two parameters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accumulator - callback function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial value - used during the first iteration by the accumulator callback function
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulatorCallbackFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Accumulator callback function has four parameters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accumulator - the value returned from the callback function after each iteration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;item - element from the array &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;index - the index for the current element being passed into the accumulator callback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source - the original array reduce is being called on
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last bonus tip - what if you want to break out of reduce before you're done iterating through all of the items?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By slicing the source array at the given index, you'll break out of the reduce functions loop - thus if you have a big data set, you can stop using computational resources once a condition is met.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With that, I'll close out by saying I highly recommend practicing reduce. It is the JavaScript function that I have found the absolute most use out of. So many times, reduce has been the solution to solving complex coding challenges in a concise and to the point way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For demo's on every single &lt;code&gt;Array.reduce&lt;/code&gt; concept we covered here. Checkout the screencast I created - we dive deep into reduce. We start from simple and build up to eventually cover all of the examples shared in this post. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Still disagree with me (after reading this post)?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Let's talk (or debate - up to you) - comment below :)&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's your opinion on JS having a best function at all? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a function you think beats reduce in JS?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do you disagree with my thought process? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How to get 100 stars every day on GitHub?</title>
      <author>Matthew Tam</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 08:34:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/matthewtamyt/how-to-get-100-stars-every-day-on-github-3ee5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/matthewtamyt/how-to-get-100-stars-every-day-on-github-3ee5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So let's start off with proof that this actually works. This is a screenshot of my repo &amp;gt; Insights &amp;gt; Traffic, where I see all the views of my repo, which has just started to blow up with views. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uzcEEv6T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7c6b0iezwaztt2lag9ix.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uzcEEv6T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7c6b0iezwaztt2lag9ix.png" alt="Screenshot (100)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my repo, by the way, if you want to check it out:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      Everything you need to know about learning Python is here. This is a catalog that teaches you how to code in Python. In fact, everything you need to know from beginner to intermediate is here. Even experts could learn from this!
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-steps-to-getting-stars"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 Steps to Getting Stars
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are 5 of the most important steps to getting more views on GitHub. Feel free to go through them step by step while modifying your own repo. So let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-repo-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 Repo Content
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised, but different repo types get very different kind of views. After thorough experimentation, I have found that tutorials on how to code a certain language racks up a lot of views. In fact, mine got 70 stars on the first day it launched without advertising. The second most popular type of repo is one that is not just a game or somewhat, but something that actually makes something better, like IDE plugins, etc. Of course, you could do more experiments on popular repos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-readme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 README
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this article, I am assuming that you really want more views and stars on your repo and that you have already gone through other articles about a pretty README. I hate to break it to you, but it's true. Spend time on your README! Make sure you get a good logo in black and white for your README. Then maybe add a GIF right below it, followed by some Shields.io. If you need a tutorial on Shields, I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl-ekLb4quE"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. The best example for this is my repo on &lt;a href="https://github.com/MatthewTamYT/Breakout"&gt;Breakout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-social-card"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3 Social Card
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social Card is the first image people see when clicking into a sharable link of your repo. People could see that it looks good and star it anyways. The truth is, many people star because it looks nice and appealing, not because it is useful. Spend some time on appearance and you may get crazy results. If you want to know more about how you should create a logo, watch this YouTube video I made, and please subscribe if you like it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-advertisement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4 Advertisement
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found out that Reddit, contrary to public belief, does not actually work a charm. However, posting to Dev.to (this website) actually got me thousands of views a day. Hacker news does not work too good either. Of course, this varies project to project, I am just trying to tell you what happened to my repo. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfRCMzMY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dg44jpyrpht2xiuspmn5.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfRCMzMY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dg44jpyrpht2xiuspmn5.JPG" alt="Capture1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is what I posted to Dev.to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/matthewtamyt" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/matthewtamyt/the-best-way-to-learn-python-beginners-friendly-1akn" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;

        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#beginners&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#programming&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-community-bits-and-bobs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 Community Bits and Bobs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the Insights tab, click Community, and finish all the tasks there. GitHub is more likely to promote your project if you meet community guidelines. This is a very quick step, but very effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-1-stargazers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus 1: Stargazers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project where you can display the names of your stars in a beautiful yet informative way. Huge thanks to NastyOx for this project: &lt;a href="https://github.com/nastyox/Repo-Roster"&gt;https://github.com/nastyox/Repo-Roster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-2-unlicense"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus 2: Unlicense
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don't like it when you tell them what they can and can't do. That's why you should choose the Unlicense License, so people are free to copy or reproduce your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-3-comment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus 3: Comment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can comment down below and give your repo name, and what it does, I will check it out, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
