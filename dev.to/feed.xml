&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons for a startup to launch a clone app – a startup lacks experience, starts with a small budget and cannot afford to take big risks. In such a scenario, the safest option for a startup is to begin with a ready to use app. This way it won’t have to spend time, money and efforts on coding an app and fixing loads of bugs. A glitch-free user experience will definitely create and increase the customer base of your app. A startup can gain a lot by launching a clone app for their business customers.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compare Between Remitano and Huobi
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remitano vs Huobi: Side-by-Side Brand Comparison&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remitano statistics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• 24h trading volume: $ 6.18 million&lt;br&gt;
• Rank: 119&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrencies listed: 16&lt;br&gt;
• Markets: 47&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Protect your crypto. There’s no need to entrust your funds to a third party, which minimizes the risk of hacking loss.&lt;br&gt;
• Global marketplace. Access any Remitano marketplace from almost anywhere in the world.&lt;br&gt;
• Good selection. Access some of the most popularly traded cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Limited Cryptos: Remitano currently only supports 6 cryptocurrencies for deposits and withdrawals. These are among the largest cryptos by market cap, however.&lt;br&gt;
• No demo account: The easy-to-use platform, however, coupled with an FAQ section and responsive customer support team allows even the more novice investor to quickly become familiar with the features.&lt;br&gt;
• Unregulated: While unregulated, Remitano does require investors to go through a verification process in order to have access to higher trading limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrency Exchanges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huobi statistics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• 24h trading volume: $5,428,983,013&lt;br&gt;
• Rank: 6&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrencies listed: 350&lt;br&gt;
• Markets: 1048&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• More than 230 tradable assets&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Three different exchanges/trading platforms &lt;br&gt;
• Leveraged and margined trading&lt;br&gt;
• High-level of cybersecurity     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
• Account registration involves a lengthy procedure&lt;br&gt;
• Low withdrawal limits&lt;br&gt;
• Low leverage for margin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Crypto Margin Trading Exchanges&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrency Exchanges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some differences:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Remitano: Unlike some other similarly sized crypto exchange platforms like Huobi, Remitano follows more stringent KYC checks, requiring users to go through a verification process before being able to trade in some cases. It is not uncommon to find trade orders on the platform that require ID verification to be done for your account. Unlike some other exchanges, Remitano does not support crypto options or futures trading.&lt;br&gt;
As a Customer Service &amp;amp; Support, Remitano offers 24/7 customer support via Intercom or Messenger, which you can easily access through the site. Additionally, the exchange offers forum functionality on its platform, allowing you to discuss crypto-related topics with other like-minded traders. The team also regularly updates the news portion of its forum. Any recent updates will be shown as a banner at the top of the site.&lt;br&gt;
As a Security, Remitano follows stringent security measures to ensure that you as a user are safe from any hack or exploit. The escrow service used by the platform ensures that sellers cannot scam buyers, as the funds are locked up and cannot be released without a successful trade or a dispute, which is handled by a member of the Remitano team.&lt;br&gt;
Huobi: As a Security, Huobi was never hacked, even though they do present a lucrative target for attackers, and we believe the exchange takes these threats seriously and does everything in their power to shield the exchange from hacks.&lt;br&gt;
To conclude, Huobi Global has managed to build a successful exchange platform, operating in the space for a long time with its reputation steadily increasing. The exchange offers a wide variety of coins to trade across many markets, and many users choose to place their funds and trust with the company, due to their proven track record, their impressive team, and their lucrative features outside the score of regular exchanges. While we do not agree with some business choices Huobi has made such as minting an exchange token, our rating remains impartial and Huobi certainly deserves a high score in the ultra-competitive crypto exchange landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-word"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last word:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remitano is best for low fees and as Customer Service &amp;amp; Support and access any Remitano marketplace, but Huobi is better for beginners and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

In this article we will learn about Bittrex clone script, how does it work and its features in detail. So you will know everything about this exchange and its clone script. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FazQCIaE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j777aaazd0dfylpwm9d6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FazQCIaE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j777aaazd0dfylpwm9d6.png" alt="bittrex exchange" width="880" height="479"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-bittrex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About Bittrex
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bittrex is a cryptocurrency exchange, an exchange website that opened in 2014. It was born as a secure site that allows you to quickly execute orders with a quick and very simple interface. Unfortunately, despite good intentions, the security problems remain, like all exchanges, even Bittrex is subject to continuous cyber-attacks, which fortunately have not yet done serious damage. Unlike its main competitors, Bittrex's primary focus is trading. &lt;br&gt;
Let's see in detail what the Bittrex exchange is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features-available-in-bittrex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features available in Bittrex.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Two-Factor Authentication.&lt;br&gt;
• Multi-sig wallets.&lt;br&gt;
• Excellent security credentials.&lt;br&gt;
• Fast transactions and withdrawals.&lt;br&gt;
• Supports over 220 currencies.&lt;br&gt;
• Fiat deposits and withdrawals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize our review, let's list the main pros and cons of Bittrex.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Very intuitive platform&lt;br&gt;
• The site has never been hacked (for now)&lt;br&gt;
• There is also a smartphone app&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

• It is not possible to sell short (aim downwards)&lt;br&gt;
• There are no guarantees on deposited funds&lt;br&gt;
• Users have to wait a long time for a response from customer support&lt;br&gt;
• The verification process can take a long time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-bittrex-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Bittrex works?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To withdraw you must verify your identity, so we recommend doing it even before depositing, otherwise you risk having problems if the account cannot be activated.&lt;br&gt;
There are two types of accounts on Bittrex:&lt;br&gt;
Basic account: easier to verify and activate, imposes as a limit the right to withdraw no more than 3 BTC (once a day).&lt;br&gt;
Advanced account: has a more accurate verification process and allows you to withdraw up to 100 BTC (once a day).&lt;br&gt;
Bittrex also operates in the United States and this is an additional security factor, while in Europe it operates with the Bittrex Global platform, which is based in Liechtenstein.&lt;br&gt;
Bittrex supports over 190 cryptocurrencies, and this makes it a very complete exchange indeed.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will find everything you require to know about two of the United States’ most popular crypto exchanges, Bittrex and Coinbase. Even though both are quite commonly used, they serve very distinct purposes. And this is exactly what we’ll cover in this guide – what makes them different and why both are among the most preferred options when it comes to crypto exchanges.&lt;br&gt;
We have collected data and statistics on Coinbase and Bittrex. Read on below to find out more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bittrex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trading volume24h: $167.14 million&lt;br&gt;
Cryptocurrencies listed:    190&lt;br&gt;
The number of users: The exchange has over half a million active users.&lt;br&gt;
Market: 648&lt;br&gt;
Market share: 0.13%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coinbase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trading volume24h: $5,494,590,361 26.21%&lt;br&gt;
Cryptocurrencies listed:    Coinbase supports more than 50 different cryptocurrencies.&lt;br&gt;
The number of users: Coinbase has 56 million users worldwide and over 2.8 million people actively exchange every month&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase generated over $1 billion in revenue in 2020, a 136 percent increase on 2019.&lt;br&gt;
Market share: %11&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase generated over $1 billion in revenue in 2020, a 136 percent increase on 2019&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase is the easier-to-use platform of the two. It’s particularly convenient for beginners because of the easy site navigation, as you won’t encounter difficult crypto trading terminology or graphs that could set you back.&lt;br&gt;
In comparison, Bittrex holds a reputation of being difficult to use. Nevertheless, some latest platform developments managed to make it more user-friendly. On its main dashboard, you’ll find a list of supported trading markets with price overviews, volume, and percentage of price changes during the last 24 hours. But even with this, it can’t compete with Coinbase. User-friendliness is where Coinbase surpasses Bittrex.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customer Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When it comes to customer support, both platforms have faced criticism regarding poor customer service. There’s a distinct support page for both Bittrex and Coinbase where you can access their FAQ section, guides, and handbooks. Both Coinbase and Bittrex offer customer support via email.&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase, however, currently does not offer any phone support with a live agent and only offers the option for phone support for emergency demands, but you must first submit an email request. Coinbase's users are content with the available options, saying 24-72 hours is what it takes them to reply.&lt;br&gt;
Unlike Coinbase, Bittrex has faced a good deal of criticism about the lack of a fast response when customers have reported major problems with their accounts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Trading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Both platforms offer a free-of-charge mobile app, accessible for download both on the Apple Store and Google Play Store. Once you are logged in, you can choose various markets, view charts, and place market orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-word"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last word
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is an excellent choice if you are looking for an easy way to get started with cryptocurrency, as it is secure and simple to use. But, if you are seeking more progressive trading options with lower fees, then we suggest Bittrex. And you can request for Bittrex clone script for starting your own business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/introduction-to-mobile-and-web-apps-with-aws-4nm8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS offers a wide range of tools and services to support development workflows for iOS, Android, React Native, and web front-end developers. There is a set of services that make it easy to build, test, and deploy an application, even with minimal knowledge of AWS. With the speed and reliability of the AWS infrastructure, mobile and web applications can scale from prototype to millions of users to provide a better user experience and better solutions for the whole integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scalable approach allows you to grow your business quickly with built-in AWS best practices for security, availability, and reliability; your application can easily scale from one request per second with microsecond latency around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will discuss some of the most important AWS Mobile and Web App services that will help you in the development and operation of web and mobile solutions, as well as speed up the whole process and make it more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9KjEkrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ydtjtj9ozqwqb0cfv1u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9KjEkrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ydtjtj9ozqwqb0cfv1u.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Introduction to AWS&lt;/strong&gt; is a Series containing different articles that provide a basic introduction to different aws topics/categories. Each article covers the detailed guide on how to work with particular topic/category . This series aims at providing "A Getting Started Guide on Different aws topics / categories ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-mobile-and-web-app-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Mobile and Web App Services
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS offers purpose-built tools and services for front-end web and mobile developers, which makes it easier to build apps with cloud functionality on AWS, so you can get to market faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS provides an end-to-end solution so you can develop, deliver, test, and monitor your app. you can also combine front-end tools with the breadth and depth of AWS services to support your evolving business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-amplify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Amplify
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3zRbpaPv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut2fjkku28ipz4cnylez.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3zRbpaPv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut2fjkku28ipz4cnylez.png" alt="image" width="140" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Amplify makes it easy to create, configure, and implement scalable mobile applications powered by AWS. Amplify seamlessly provisions and manages your mobile backend and provides a simple framework to easily integrate your backend with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native frontends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amplify also automates the application release process of both your frontend and backend allowing you to deliver features faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile applications require cloud services for actions that can’t be done directly on the device, such as offline data synchronization, storage, or data sharing across multiple users. You often have to configure, set up, and manage multiple services to power the backend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also have to integrate each of those services into your application by writing multiple lines of code. However, as the number of application features grow, your code and release process becomes more complex and managing the backend requires more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amplify provisions and manages backends for your mobile applications. You just select the capabilities you need such as authentication, analytics, or offline data sync and Amplify will automatically provision and manage the AWS service that powers each of the capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then integrate those capabilities into your application through the Amplify libraries and UI components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-cognito"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Cognito
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QRcQ_cwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/udt25l9bfsm0i04d5hcg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QRcQ_cwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/udt25l9bfsm0i04d5hcg.png" alt="image" width="162" height="163"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the option to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Amazon Cognito enables you to save data locally on users’ devices, allowing your applications to work even when the devices are oﬄine. You can then synchronize data across users’ devices so that their app experience remains consistent regardless of the device they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management, authentication, and sync across devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-pinpoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Pinpoint
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4eqhOaOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7i133ig560ohxkrowumf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4eqhOaOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7i133ig560ohxkrowumf.png" alt="image" width="138" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Pinpoint makes it easy to send targeted messages to your customers through multiple engagement channels. Examples of targeted campaigns are promotional alerts and customer retention campaigns, and transactional messages are messages such as order confirmations and password reset messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can integrate Amazon Pinpoint into your mobile and web apps to capture usage data to provide you with insight into how customers interact with your apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Pinpoint also tracks the ways that your customers respond to the messages you send—for example, by showing you the number of messages that were delivered, opened, or clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can develop custom audience segments and send them pre-scheduled targeted campaigns via email, SMS, and push notifications. Targeted campaigns are useful for sending promotional or educational content to re-engage and retain your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can send transactional messages using the console or the Amazon Pinpoint REST API. Transactional campaigns can be sent via email, SMS, push notifications, and voice messages. You can also use the API to build custom applications that deliver campaign and transactional messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-device-farm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Device Farm
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3BHSGyxE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yk3oda3ccqph5eci4wef.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3BHSGyxE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yk3oda3ccqph5eci4wef.png" alt="image" width="140" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Device Farm is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-location-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Location Service
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0q1cOBkp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bwu104erzc36axj1xw41.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0q1cOBkp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bwu104erzc36axj1xw41.png" alt="image" width="141" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Location Service provides affordable data, tracking and geofencing capabilities, and native integrations with AWS services, so you can create sophisticated location-enabled applications quickly, without the high cost of custom development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You retain control of your location data with Amazon Location, and you can combine proprietary data with data from the service. Amazon Location provides cost-effective location-based services (LBS) using high-quality data from global, trusted providers Esri and HERE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-chime-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Chime SDK
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MwwnE3K9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5jutojjxwydb5dyr9vx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MwwnE3K9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5jutojjxwydb5dyr9vx.png" alt="image" width="159" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Chime SDK is a set of real-time communications components that developers can use to quickly add messaging, audio, video, and screen sharing capabilities to their web or mobile applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can leverage the same communication infrastructure and services that power Amazon Chime, an online meetings service from AWS, and deliver engaging experiences in their applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, they can add video to a health application so patients can consult with doctors on health issues remotely, or create customized audio prompts for integration with the public telephone network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the Amazon Chime SDK, developers can help eliminate the cost, complexity, and friction of creating and maintaining their own real-time communication infrastructure and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-app-runner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync is a serverless back-end for mobile, web, and enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync makes it easy to build data driven mobile and web applications by handling securely all the application data management tasks like online and offline data access, data synchronization, and data manipulation across multiple data sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync uses GraphQL, an API query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax for describing their data requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Location Service makes it easy for developers to add location functionality to applications without compromising data security and user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location data is a vital ingredient in today’s applications, enabling capabilities ranging from asset tracking to location-based marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, developers face significant barriers when integrating location functionality into their applications. This includes cost, privacy and security compromises, and tedious and slow integration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the development of mobile and web applications is closely related to cloud services in the form of a backend. The bulk of functionality in mobile and web applications is designed to communicate with the backend and to make calls to the corresponding API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s system to develop mobile applications is constantly being updated with interesting functions. It also offers an authentication system, the ability to quickly build flexible APIs via GraphQL, and the ability to test in the cloud using real devices, which is essential for testers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this guide gives you an Introduction to Mobile and Web Apps with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will find out what White Label Crypto Exchange Software is, how does it work, and what are the exclusive features, benefits and its types. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this highly competitive environment, it is crucial to stand out from the crowd. And as a result, marketers invented white-label solutions. Business owners are preferring White-label software/app over independent branding. White labeling is getting more and more popular with each passing day as a result of the rapid development of the tech world. Now, in 2021, if you are a great marketer, you don’t necessarily have to develop your own online tools. Instead of that, you can implement a white label solution and solve all your problems in a few clicks.&lt;br&gt;
Let's start with the basics definitions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EeW_siHi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jwsyfd3x9eibwfjmwq59.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EeW_siHi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jwsyfd3x9eibwfjmwq59.png" alt="What is crypto exchange platform" width="880" height="660"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  What is crypto exchange platform?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency Exchange platform permits the users to purchase and sell digital assets and cryptocurrencies spontaneously. The main challenge one faces in the development of the same is not the feature-set but the data transfer speed along with the data security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#how-does-white-labelling-work-in-software-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does White Labelling work in software applications?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White labeling services, as a concept, is pretty straightforward in software development too. A company purchases a white-label product and presents them to the end customer under their own brand name. White-Label Solution developers are becoming popular because many business owners cannot afford to hire a big team of professionals to do the software development from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-using-of-whitelabel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and disadvantages using of White-Label
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantages: &lt;br&gt;
• Reduced Crypto Exchange Development Costs: Using a white-label means that you don’t need to get coding resources. Whether in the form of an in-house software development team, or an outsourced development company, the costs of software production quickly mount up. A white label avoids this process almost entirely.&lt;br&gt;
• Large contracts: Third-party producers get huge contracts, which could come with guaranteed sales and revenue.&lt;br&gt;
• Discounted sales: Stores can boost revenue by selling white-label products at a discount relative to national brands.&lt;br&gt;
• Quality. White-label brands can be just as good as national brands, as they often use the same producers; high quality creates satisfied customers.&lt;br&gt;
• Save your development time.&lt;br&gt;
• White labeling boosts the visibility of your brand. &lt;br&gt;
• White labeling strengthens the loyalty of clients. &lt;br&gt;
• White labeling allows you to take advantage of expert work. &lt;br&gt;
• White labeling provides your brand with a refined product. &lt;br&gt;
• White labeling saves you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br&gt;
• Copycatting. Using very similar packaging among brands is called copycatting, which can be illegal in some cases. Private label brands must differentiate themselves sufficiently so as not to mislead consumers.&lt;br&gt;
• Barriers to entry. The growing dominance of white label brands could make it hard for new firms to enter the market, reducing overall competition.&lt;br&gt;
• Only a few companies offer core customization, which is hardly enough for a decent feature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9fRhDyfm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1m0dc1plmq5o0azez0p7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9fRhDyfm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1m0dc1plmq5o0azez0p7.png" alt="Types of Cryptocurrency exchange platform" width="880" height="377"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-platform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Cryptocurrency exchange platform:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#peertopeer-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Peer-to-peer exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2P exchanges provide the sale and purchase of cryptocurrency directly between users. Traders leave their orders as on a bulletin board, and other network participants can respond to the offers and agree on the terms of buy/sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decentralized-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decentralized crypto exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralized exchanges provide transfers of funds directly between users' wallets. This reduces the potential for theft from exchange hacking since the exchange never actually stores cryptocurrency. However, you should keep in mind that in such exchanges, the lack of moderating third-party shifts all responsibility for errors and security to the users themselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#centralized-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Centralized Crypto exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most common type of exchange. Such exchanges have a centralized operator who is responsible for security, updates, and functionality. Centralized exchanges manage order books, which record all buy and sell orders. The weak point of this type is that coins are stored in the services themselves, which increases the likelihood of losing your funds due to hacker attacks. Therefore, centralized exchanges work hard to ensure the proper level of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#white-label-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  White label Crypto exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A customer saves up their time as the platform is ready-made. In fact, the characteristics and the work ability are already tested and used by various other traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#p2a-crypto-exchange-peer-to-admin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  P2A crypto exchange (peer to admin)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin trading always happens through a bitcoin trading website. Here admin (owner) of the website has the power to set the selling price and buying price of bitcoin. So traders are allowed to trade only with the specified price rate. Since the admin has the control over the price fixing, he can gain a huge profit from every successful trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#escrow-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Escrow Crypto Exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escrow based exchange built by programming like PHP, JavaScript, MEAN and MERN that will act as a trusted 3rd party interface sends and receives cryptocurrencies on end of two parties.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vd31zzjI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/55ai4alvze8s783d0ogi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vd31zzjI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/55ai4alvze8s783d0ogi.png" alt="What is a White label crypto exchange" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  What is a White label crypto exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;generally, ‘White Label’ refers to a customizable product and, or service that is developed by one company and sold to another. In other words, the development company sells the rights of a white-label solution to its client company, either fully or partially. Apart from being time-saving, such solutions prove to be economical for businesses. A white-label exchange is a market-ready solution with ready-to-deploy back-end and easy-to-customize front-end. The UI/UX can be easily customized as per brand requirements and the software can be quickly launched into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boost Your Efficiency: Top 5 Productivity Plugins For Dev Teams 🔥🔥🔥
</title>
      <author>Barbara Lavigne</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 09:39:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/barbara66871045/boost-your-efficiency-top-5-productivity-plugins-for-dev-teams-369p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/barbara66871045/boost-your-efficiency-top-5-productivity-plugins-for-dev-teams-369p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is your team as productive as can be? We tend to be most productive while using tools we know and like best, that’s why in the majority of dev teams you’re free to code with your weapon of choice (aka IDE). So no matter if you’re utterly loyal to VS Code or you’re a die-hard-JetBrains: these 5 cross-IDE tools are definitely worth checking out!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gitlive-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitLive for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamHub.teamhub"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11955-gitlive"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming your team uses Git then GitLive is a no-brainer enhancement of your IDE’s built-in Git functionality. Once installed it adds a team view showing all work in progress for each collaborator from your Git repository. Any non-stale branch ahead of master/main is considered work in progress and you can inspect diffs of the files changed as well as view the associated issue or pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y_MXRQus--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637067038956/EV-sykzcsg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y_MXRQus--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637067038956/EV-sykzcsg.png" alt="image (5).png" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my favourite feature is probably the automatic merge conflict detection. The difference between your local changes and the work in progress of your teammates is shown for your current open file in the gutter of your editor. It shows you the type of change (addition, deletion, modification or conflict) and you can inspect it to see the diff, what branch it's from and even cherry-pick into your local file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
GitLive can be very useful for larger teams and especially useful for open or inner source projects as these features even work across forks. What’s also cool is as the data comes straight from Git, there’s no manual entry required to keep it up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tabnine-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tabnine for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12798-tabnine-ai-code-completion-js-java-python-ts-rust-go-php--more"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of ways to speed up your coding? Tabnine might be exactly what you’re looking for. It's an AI code completion tool that indexes your code and finds statistical patterns to create customized suggestions based on how you write your own code. It allows you to code faster with fewer syntax errors and more code snippets to look into right in your IDE. It gets better with time as it gains more material to analyse, both if you work solo or in a team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin supports most popular languages, libraries, and frameworks, including Python, Javascript, Java, React, Vue, Rust Typescript, PHP, Angular, C / C++/ C# and Kotlin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NEjWlbHS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634224504302/K2icWaZhj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NEjWlbHS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634224504302/K2icWaZhj.png" alt="tabnine.png" width="880" height="530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabnine comes in a pro version for bigger teams that uses an advanced AI model and a basic version based on a smaller AI model. Both versions also support Team Trained AI (trained and run locally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
Tabnine Teams is trained on your team’s projects, preferences, and patterns. Every interaction improves AI accuracy, bringing its value to the whole team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stepsize-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stepsize for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stepsize.stepsize"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14515-issue-tracker-in-ide"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the health of your codebase requires effort from the whole team and Stepsize is an example of a tool that can save you time spent on tracking and addressing potential problems. It’s an issue tracker inside your editor for managing technical debt and maintenance issues. Sometimes while coding we encounter issues that need fixing, but don’t have time to do it straight away. Thanks to this handy plugin you can bookmark code and create TODOs straight in your IDE without affecting your workflow! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z22caAYu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223594148/uhJrGdX0I.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z22caAYu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223594148/uhJrGdX0I.gif" alt="stepsize.gif" width="800" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
The plugin makes it easy to collaborate with your teammates on maintenance and refactoring work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#editorconfig-for-vs-code-or-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  EditorConfig for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig/versions"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EditorConfig is a great help when it comes to maintaining consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the most built-in language-specific formatters, EditorConfig's settings apply to all kinds of files, clearing git diff of trailing whitespace, newlines or indentation characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---15ae9aF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223746549/JLKUyZprM.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---15ae9aF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223746549/JLKUyZprM.jpeg" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-12 at 10.43.54.jpeg" width="880" height="592"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
The extension automatically sets the correct IDE settings for each project you switch into, so every developer working on the project will write code in the same style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-comments-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better Comments for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10850-better-comments"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin is an example of how a very simple idea can improve the quality of our work. It’s an effective and customisable extension that takes care of creating “human-friendly” (more readable and organised) comments in your code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can categorise your annotations into: Alerts, Queries, TODOs and Highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hrBJXaH7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223548861/-uahqW1S1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hrBJXaH7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223548861/-uahqW1S1.png" alt="better-comments.png" width="459" height="414"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes with default comment styles, but any other comment styles can be specified in the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
Immediately spot important TODOs in your code, so nothing gets overlooked!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope some of the awesome plugins I rounded up in this post will make your team collaboration faster, more efficient and productive. Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>📚🏆 Top 20 Web Development Learning Resources: From Beginner to Advanced</title>
      <author>Alex Omeyer</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 09:35:14 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/alexomeyer/top-20-web-development-learning-resources-from-beginner-to-advanced-4h8a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development"&gt;Web development&lt;/a&gt; refers to the act of building and maintaining websites; these websites can range in complexity from simple static websites to more complex web applications with huge databases, real-time data-intensive applications such as social media and eCommerce applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back-end developers&lt;/strong&gt; designs the application APIs and databases schemas and implements the business logic. Backend developers were originally referred to as developers back in the days when front-end development was considered to be trivial work. Backend developers can employ a wide range of languages to achieve their needs. A backend developer would be skilled in languages such as PHP, Java, Python, ASP.net, Ruby, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-end developers&lt;/strong&gt; consume the APIs and implement the logic to handle a website’s presentation,  interactivity, and user experience. Unlike backend, the front-end developer’s main scripting language is JavaScript. However, there is an overwhelming amount of JavaScript frameworks, libraries, bundlers, and build tools available for front-end development. And oftentimes a front-end developer is specialised in one or more of these. Some examples of these front-end technologies are React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Webpack, Rollup, Snowpack, ESbuild, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides JavaScript, front-end developers also use HTML and CSS to both structure and beautify a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-stack developers&lt;/strong&gt; are developers who has both front-end and back-end development skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the area of specialisation, good developers follow the &lt;a href="https://www.stepsize.com/blog/how-to-be-an-effective-boy-girl-scout-engineer?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;boy/girl scout rule&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;always leave the code better than you found it&lt;/strong&gt;. And they achieve this by using &lt;a href="https://dev.to/alexomeyer/10-must-have-vs-code-extensions-to-improve-your-productivity-4goe"&gt;tools that enhance productivity&lt;/a&gt;, improve code quality, foster collaboration, and manage technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development is a highly paid skill that is currently in great demand.With the advent of Covid, many businesses and services are moving online; thereby, increasing the need for web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, now is the best time to learn web development—let's look at the websites and online platforms to learn software development!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-road-map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://roadmap.sh/"&gt;1. Road Map&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning web development is a journey and for this, you would need a road map. One of the biggest challenges faced by new developers when learning web development is not knowing where to start, what to learn, or the path to achieve their goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roadmap.sh is a community effort to create roadmaps, guides, and other educational content to help guide the developers in picking up the path and guide their learnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read map provides downloadable visual guides containing topics, tools, languages, and all the required niceties to guide a noob developer in his journey to web development mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React.js - JSX</title>
      <author>The Nerdy Dev</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 09:10:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thenerdydev/reactjs-jsx-4a3g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thenerdydev/reactjs-jsx-4a3g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys 👋🏻,&lt;br&gt;
In this post, let us learn what JSX is in React and why it is important for us as React developers to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r_GJOTfp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxogniwdxp9s31063jvq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r_GJOTfp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxogniwdxp9s31063jvq.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, let us understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✔ What is JSX ?&lt;br&gt;
✔ Example of JSX&lt;br&gt;
✔ JSX code being equivalent to React.createElement calls.&lt;br&gt;
✔ JSX Restrictions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-jsx-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is JSX ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. *It is used to write HTMLish code in JavaScript files which later gets transpiled to normal JavaScript by our development workflow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-of-jsx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example of JSX
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QuIIx9GA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8m85vhghflvem3s5pjcz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QuIIx9GA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8m85vhghflvem3s5pjcz.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="504"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, you can see we are returning &lt;strong&gt;HTMLish kind of code&lt;/strong&gt; from our component function. &lt;strong&gt;personName&lt;/strong&gt; is a variable that we are interpolating right inside the template of our component. This in the end gets transpiled to JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Transpilation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QuIIx9GA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8m85vhghflvem3s5pjcz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QuIIx9GA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8m85vhghflvem3s5pjcz.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="504"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Transpilation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VWcosHbt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/du4p7eot77dgy4gji72z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VWcosHbt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/du4p7eot77dgy4gji72z.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSX code is nothing but multiple calls to the &lt;strong&gt;React.createElement&lt;/strong&gt; method to build up the HTML for our component. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#jsx-restrictions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JSX Restrictions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows us to write &lt;strong&gt;HTMLish&lt;/strong&gt; code that we write in JavaScript files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It enforces restrictions on some keywords that we cannot use like &lt;strong&gt;class&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; etc that are reserved keywords in JavaScript. We have equivalents for them though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JSX expression must have exactly one &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; element and it is under this &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; element that you nest your JSX code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Add Notifications to a 3rd party Website</title>
      <author>Michael Salaverry</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 09:09:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/barakplasma/add-notifications-to-a-3rd-party-website-4g1o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/barakplasma/add-notifications-to-a-3rd-party-website-4g1o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever had to monitor a long running process on a webpage like Jenkins? Constantly switching tabs to check if a long running task is finished is a pain, and we can ameliorate it with a small amount of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification"&gt;MDN has a great article on the notification API&lt;/a&gt; so I'll skip that part in this blog post. (Flavio Copes also wrote &lt;a href="https://flaviocopes.com/notifications-api/"&gt;a great introduction to the Notification API&lt;/a&gt;) What I want to show you is how to use that API in a page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a great tool called &lt;a href="https://violentmonkey.github.io/"&gt;Violent Monkey&lt;/a&gt; which lets you add your own Javascript userscripts to run on a 3rd party website. Using a userscript, we can trigger the Notification API for almost any page event. (There's also a cool separate tool for adding your own CSS called &lt;a href="https://add0n.com/stylus.html"&gt;stylus&lt;/a&gt; which is outside the scope of this blog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick is to add an event listener or selector in Javascript for the thing you want to notify on. For example, when Jenkins finishes a build, it changes the header color from blue to green or red. We can use a CSS selector via &lt;code&gt;document.querySelector()&lt;/code&gt; that when a classname has been added to a specific DOM node, that our script will trigger a notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out my example using the selector method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notice that it runs in a somewhat recursive loop, with a base case that does not trigger a second alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which pages do you need a notification for?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1 line of code: How to clean an Array of  "falsy" items
</title>
      <author>martin krause</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:47:38 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/martinkr/1-line-of-code-how-to-clean-an-array-of-falsy-items-5ahf</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cleanFalsy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Returns a new array without all items which are considered to be "false" (0, '', Nan, false, undefined, null).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 5 Developer Issues You’ll Face</title>
      <author>Shane Wood</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:43:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shane_wood_904582d9aa3731/top-5-developer-issues-youll-face-3kcm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shane_wood_904582d9aa3731/top-5-developer-issues-youll-face-3kcm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your coworker is leaving for a better job offer? You’re exhausted from working? You’re sick of constant learning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not all. A lot more happens behind the office doors. You should know top developer issues and prepare for them upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the ugly truth of what developers experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You want to quit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re underpaid, and you want better compensation. You’re working for the market rate salary. Compensation below the market average isn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get a better job offer. But your company doesn’t care. You’re baffled how’s this possible. Even after a few years, no one values your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies don’t care about matching other’s offers. They would rather let you go&lt;a href="https://nofilmschool.com/boards/questions/astonishing-dubai-call-girls-0529579100-call-girls-dubai-agency"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and hire an underpaid developer. This stupid behavior is only making great developers flee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the gist of this story? Companies gamble with developers. You can ace the interview, and perform poorly in the trenches. You need to prepare for this disadvantage of software engineering. Don’t embrace the family feeling, you’re working there. The company won’t budge if you leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New companies don’t gamble. They provide correct compensation and match other offers you get. Offers from newer companies are genuine. Older companies will create excuses to lower your compensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You’ll be exhausted&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is demanding. Demanding a lot of intellect. Tight deadlines, useless documentation, and bad business needs. Software engineering can lead to exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software maintenance can exhaust you. Old features need maintenance. You won’t always work from scratch. Software developers fix old bugs or change the existing structure. Working on old stuff kills your motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working on microservices and others are moving checkboxes around&lt;a href="https://nofilmschool.com/boards/questions/want-call-girls-dubai-0529877582-indian-call-girls-dubai-0"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; my coworker is bored to death since he didn’t write code for weeks. He will leave for better software engineering. There’s no meaningful goal and you get bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers want to be hired for their skills, and treated as experts, and allowed to make decisions within their own realm of expertise.¹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ideas won’t be valued. This can get exhausting and infuriating. What’s the worst thing about this behavior? Fixing the bugs which wouldn’t be there with your idea. This happens and you need to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although exhausting it’s rewarding. Users using your software will make you love the process even more. If you don’t love the process, both bad and good sides, you’ll get exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You get sick of learning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to learn every day. Every day brings new bugs, new features, and new people. New ideas flow each day. New ideas bring new breakthroughs. New ideas make you learn new things.&lt;br&gt;
Learning never stops. From deploying lambdas on AWS&lt;a href="https://www.kabayan.ae/datings/outcall-overnight-dubai-call-girls-0529501107-call-girls-dubai/"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; creating single-page apps, and developing MACH architecture. All this needs a lot of brainpower. Learning never stops, and you might get overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you might not like about learning? Most learning happens at the expense of your free time. You won’t learn much during working hours. Companies will organize workshops, unpaid, and after working hours. You need to sacrifice your personal time to learn new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to accept constant learning. You should stick with companies investing in your personal development. The company thinks long-term. They prepare for the unknown road ahead. Learning is good practice, but it’s time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning is time-consuming but learning is essential. COBOL is lucrative nowadays, but so is JavaScript. You should always focus on the gist of programming. Don’t learn the popular XYZ language. Learn the basics, create foundational knowledge&lt;a href="https://www.cybo.com/US-biz/dubai-call-girls-service-call-girls"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and continue expanding your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You’ll work overtime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re debugging a pesky bug. But it’s the end of the working day. YOu don’t want to leave it for the next day. You stay overtime, to find out you can’t fix it. Hours passed which you can’t recover. You work overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline is a few days away. You’re halfway through your feature. Business comes with a new set of business needs. You work overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re working on a simple task. Refactoring code, or adding a simple logic change. You find several small bugs with the code. You think they’re an easy fix. Turns out they aren’t an easy fix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You work overtime again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extended overtime is a productivity-reduction technique, anyway. The extra hours are almost always more than offset by the negative side effects. This is true even if you don’t consider the disruption of the team. When you take into account the way that the team members&lt;a href="https://www.foodgloba.com/AE/Dubai/102749538793842/Call-Girls-Dubai-0529238486-VIP-and-Lovely"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; differing abilities to work overtime tends to destroy teams, the case against it becomes persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this behavior, plan your work upfront. Cal Newport suggests² you should plan every minute of your day. David Allen suggests³ leaving reminders of important work. Reminders such as notes how far you’ve come with an important task. Work notes and scheduling help remove a lot of the overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bugs come and go. And they return to haunt you. When you don’t have the proper log&lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dubai-call-girls-0564419067-call-girls-dubai"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; you need to do the same work twice. Log the solution, script, or query, so you can re-use the solution in the future. This helps me move a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You’ll work more than you imagine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no clear role boundaries. One day you work on styling. Another deploy lambda functions. That’s my story, started as a frontend developer, and now working as a backend developer. I get tasks well out of my role, such as figuring out JavaScript issues. The point is you get work way beyond your role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for smaller teams, disguised startups&lt;a href="https://www.cybo.com/AE-biz/dubai-call-girls"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and real startups this happens a lot. Working with fewer coworkers will make you do more. Doing more of what you didn’t sign up for. Working with an enterprise company this won’t happen. There’s always a dedicated team for every software aspect. Both paths have their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With smaller teams, you’ll learn more. Learn more and learn faster. With bigger teams&lt;a href="https://www.foodgloba.com/AE/Dubai/105493395263510/Dubai-Model-Girls-0529537014-Call"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; you’ll specialize. You’ll specialize in one thing and do that excellent. You pick what suits you best.&lt;br&gt;
Have a high-level view of the whole software product. Double down on one thing. You’re working on a Spring app? Learn Spring in detail and become a Spring expert. Become a specialist and have a bigger picture in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
