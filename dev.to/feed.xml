      <title>RecatJS CRUD operations using Local Storage</title>
      <author>Deepak</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/deepakjaiswal/recatjs-crud-operations-using-local-storage-3ih2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;many developers using localStorage for learning or some operation&lt;br&gt;
like add to cart and store token or user information into the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-local-storage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is local Storage?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;local storage is type of memory in our browser to save our data.&lt;br&gt;
local storage storage limit is 5 MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;local storage is our browser memory so we can store everything in our browser using javascript or ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
localStorage.setItem("key","value");
localStorage.getItem("key");
localStorage.removeItem("key");
console.log(localStorage)
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-reactjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In ReactJS
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function App(){
localStorage.setItem("key","value");
const store=localStorage.getItem("key");
localStorage.removeItem("key");
console.log(localStorage)

return(
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
{store}
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

)}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In many users questions how we store array of object in localStorage. here is the solution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const data={
name:"Deepak",
address:"Allahabad"
}
localStorage.setItem("user",JSON.stringify(data))

const user=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"))

console.log(user)
//it return {name :"Deepak", address :"Allahabad"}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>10+ Best Christmas and New Year Gift Ideas for Developers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: This post includes affiliate links; I may receive compensation if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NYgVLUUO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c7rkzn0wt7ugbxdo0qd0.jpg" alt="best gift ideas for programmers" width="880" height="608"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, it's that time of the year again when we buy gifts for our loved ones, friends, and colleagues. If you are looking for gift ideas for your programmer friends and colleagues then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend circle has a lot of programmers and non-programmers. When it comes to buying &lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/12/top-5-amazing-gifts-for-programmers-coders.html"&gt;gifts&lt;/a&gt; for birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays, I receive a lot of queries from my non-programmer family and friends about what to buy for a programmer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, buying a gift is easy but choosing or finding the right gift for someone is really really tough. I have had this experience when it comes to buying gifts for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know they like toys but my wife told me to buy something more valuable, which not only keeps them engaged but also provides value, helps them in learning and they appreciate it every time they use it. That's a lot to cater to one gift, but that's the perfect gift, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for programmers, you buy them something which they don't care about will not make a difference, they will gleefully accept it, and it will remain in the corner of the house, but, if you give something which they can use daily or carve for, they will not only remember you every day but also &lt;strong&gt;appreciate your sense of gift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be in their good books for a long time. This is particularly important if you try to impress your colleague or boss, who happens to be a technical guy or programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any gift, the budget is significant; some gifts are good, but if they are costly and you can't afford them, then they are not useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if you want to give someone who is dear to you, like your husband, boyfriend, brother, or just a close friend, you definitely want to buy more valuable gifts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I have included both precious and somewhat expensive, as well as many affordable gifts, which you can buy for under 100$. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-best-gifts-for-programmers-and-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11 Best Gifts for Programmers and Developers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the best gifts you can give to your programmer friends. The gifts are listed in random order, and some of them are costly, you can choose based on your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-fitness-tracker-or-equipment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. Fitness tracker or equipment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another awesome gift you can give someone you love. Since many programmers lack physical activity, you not only encourage them to do more physical activity but also improve their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing in recent time which I have seen encourage programmer to spend more time away from screen and doing some exercise or active lifestyle is fitness tracker and its no surprise because programmer also love stats which these trackers provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are short of ideas on which fitness tracker to buy for your programmer friend then this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Graphite/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;Fitbit Charge 5 Advanced Fitness &amp;amp; Health Tracker&lt;/a&gt; is great one to gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes with Built-in GPS, Stress Management Tools, Sleep Tracking, 24/7 Heart Rate and More. They may not appreciate it in a short time, but they will surely do in the long run :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Graphite/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aD0hnvIy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jtt2mej73piig6sqe1oq.png" alt="best fitness tracker for progarmmers" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-gift-a-course-from-udemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2.  **&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;amp;type=10&amp;amp;tmpid=14494&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.udemy.com%252F"&gt;Gift a course from Udemy&lt;/a&gt;**
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers love online courses, including me, and Udemy is the biggest collection of online courses. It has got over 55,000 online courses to learn anything, like starting from popular programming languages like Java and Python to advanced technology, like Big Data, Automation, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Robotics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Udemy allows you to send a course or a gift card to your programmer friend, you just need to enter his email while purchasing the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife gifted me the &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2BYyDkV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python &amp;amp; R In Data Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I simply loved it. If your husband is interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Artificial intelligence, then you can gift that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;amp;type=10&amp;amp;tmpid=14494&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.udemy.com%252F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1rtqVvyk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F7cRHnf4dPU/Wj0DOrXsFSI/AAAAAAAAJvk/z-0-_GR4IMMNoXab5ipsBdrvm8hRst43QCLcBGAs/w400-h251/Udemy%252Bgift%252Bto%252Bprogrammers.png" alt="Top 5 Amazing Gifts for Programmers and developers" width="399" height="251"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know what your husband or boyfriend likes, then you can choose some excellent courses from Udemy; otherwise, I just bought a gift card for them.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-plurasight-membership"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;Plurasight Membership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programmer appreciates memberships. You can buy the Pluralsight annual membership, which costs around 299$. It's a little bit expensive, but it offers him a lot of choices on learning, and your programmer friend will appreciate it every time he uses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about the cost side, then monthly membership is also a good option, which costs around 29$. The annual membership of Pluralsight is a little bit costly, but it's worth every penny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fgift-of-pluralsight"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r84ZT6jW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg10nELoi8V6OR3QTK1aFcm7OP29vj896ZLAuqJfRVtbR3MjlNdvKK1kZ5mgxhDv-fc-vWhsRPOW_JcI4tcMMvkCCbyWPvxim_J0z6Uxv13msPuG5lpXAZDxfgeNuyqbcw_lWchWB-AXUkapKXAjN9WMIHShxYeHCoqMEh4MryDrynHUnvSkuVjEAMo%3Dw392-h271" alt="Best Gift ideas for Programmers and Developers" width="392" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4new-16inch-macbook-pro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4.&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-inch-16GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;New 16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers Love Gadgets, and nothing beats Apple when it comes to gadgets. If you are a programmer, friends don't have MacBook Pro, then it's a perfect idea to gift that to them. Apple just announced a new 16-inch MacBook Pro, which many people call the ultimate developer machine, and I also think it is the best programmer gift for 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Apple fixing the keyboard issue, here are some of the major highlights of New 16-inch MacBook Pro, looking like an awesome Developer machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  16-inch Retina display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Up to 8-core processor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Up to 8TB SSD storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Up to 64GB of memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Up to 11 hours of battery life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Dedicated escape key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Dedicated arrow buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Six-speaker sound system and studio-quality mics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-inch-16GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6qUVaemd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Goh0crITLc/XdSnQFTDXOI/AAAAAAAAb0Y/KyOLzllRBzkP0TzeCwpDL0rUAv1hnSEUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Apple_16-inch-MacBook-Pro_best_Programmer_Gift.jpeg" alt="Best Gifts for Programmers" width="400" height="289"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it's costly, but if he is someone you love or are very close to, then it's definitely worth it, and whoever you gift it will not forget you for a long time.  In fact, this is the ultimate gift for a programmer, it's on the wish list too just in case if you want to gift me :-)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-educative-unlimited"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. &lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/subscription?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;Educative Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another great platform to learn the online platform and allows you to gift a subscription to anyone you want. Educative is a bit different than Udemy and Pluralsight because it's a text-based, interactive platform that is different than watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Educative is that they have an excellent collection of courses for coding interviews like Grokking the System Design Interview and Grokking the Coding interview pattern. If you give the gift of Educative unlimited to your friend then they will appreciate it a lot while preparing for their next interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use it to level up their tech skill as it has more than 250+ courses with new courses added every week. They are also offering a holiday special plan now where you can buy a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/subscription?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;2 years plan for just $12.9 per month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/subscription?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cb4IxGOK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lI3d4z9vvT4/Yblw05kEOgI/AAAAAAAAqi8/g6mUeiZNBDsaevfLRQ_wlntVGj9ADZuRQCNcBGAsYHQ/w412-h232/09f5aae6490cdc520fc93292bbe0da28b0cfdf31.jpeg" alt="best course subscription gifts for developers" width="412" height="232"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-amazon-prime-music-subscription"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/PrimeMusic?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;Amazon Prime Music subscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing programmers Loves is music, they just never get tired of listening to music. Many programmers, in fact, need music to work and increase their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Music is the biggest collection of music, and your programmer friend will surely find something he loves in this big store of music. He will appreciate your thoughts and effort every time he listens to music on his Bose headset as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2015/12/3-gifts-for-your-java-programmer.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UnyhrpWR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GHSZCe7clsw/WjErg7cy4II/AAAAAAAAJrY/VxkJpFTKpEALpPQy1cxmLnJk6Xh88h1dgCEwYBhgL/w400-h260/Amazon%252BPrime%252BMusic.jpg" alt="best gift for software engineers" width="400" height="260"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-raspberry-pi"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LANDZO-Raspberry-Pi-Model-8gb/dp/B08R87H4RR?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi has been around for a while, but it seems like it just keeps getting awesome. Programmers are curious people and to play with electronics. Raspberry Pi is an entire mini-computer for a ridiculously low price, and you can get an excellent bundle, like this one, which adds all kinds of cool stuff to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also great for tinkering around with teaching programming to kids or making your own network of servers. Once, I ran Linux on my Rasberry Pi and used putty to connect it, how awesome is that? In short, one of the best gadgets to gift your programmer friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LANDZO-Raspberry-Pi-Model-8gb/dp/B08R87H4RR?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9hosMIVe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7d6gwxh1ykqrk201g2b.jpg" alt="best gadget gifts for programmers" width="880" height="551"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-books"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;8. Books&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to gadgets and music Programmers also like books a lot, but with the book, there is confusion. Which book you should buy for them? A novel, a programming book, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, even though many programmers like fantasy books and novels, they are not so valuable for them, but if you buy them something like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grokking Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, books which every programmer can read, they will appreciate it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need more books to gift programs there are a lot of choices available, you should check out my list of 10 books every programmer should read &lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2015/03/10-books-every-programmer-and-software-engineer-read.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-logitech-g710-mechanical-gaming-keyboard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Keyboard-Tactile-High-Speed/dp/B009C98NPY?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;Logitech G710+ Mechanical Gaming Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every programmer needs an excellent keyboard, and your friend will not be different. Though some programmers like a silent keyboard and some programmers like a Gaming keyboard, I like gaming one more because I also play games on my PC. Logitech is one of the best companies for peripheral devices, so to me, this keyboard is a great buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a fantastic mechanical keyboard, it also has a bunch of really cool gaming features, so I'm a big fan of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Keyboard-Tactile-High-Speed/dp/B009C98NPY?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rUs3XE0s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_gROK7ih3BI/WjEse-pW_1I/AAAAAAAAJrk/nMN1cAV8cPwG0AiVY08pzOnF-doE4-77gCLcBGAs/s320/Logitech%252BGAming%252BKeyboard%252B-%252Bgift%252Bfor%252Bprogrammer.jpg" alt="best keyboard for programmers" width="291" height="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-pc-and-console-games"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;10. PC and Console Games&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gadgets, music, and books, Programmers love Games too, well I certainly do. I have grown up playing Nintendo games like Super Mario Bros, Mortal Combat, and I still play games on my Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, either you can buy your friend a gaming console like Xbox or Nintendo PI, or if he already has one, you can buy them games like Minecraft. That's something they will enjoy for sure.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-intel-boxed-compute-stick-with-windows-10-preloaded"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Compute-Computer-Processor-BOXSTK1AW32SC/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;Intel Boxed Compute Stick with Windows 10 Pre-Loaded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really awesome gift for tech geeks? An entire computer, complete with Windows 10, is on a stick. You just plug this thing into a TV or monitor, and you have a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2017/10/5-best-gifts-for-programmers-and-software-developers-geeks.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K1TkSYTk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CM8oJLvr9O8/WjEtW9LdLzI/AAAAAAAAJrw/dMJananOi60xlfb_BOcLvT6qJh2Wh2MVACLcBGAs/s320/Intel%252BCompute%252BStick.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the best part of it is that it will just you over $100. Simply Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all on this &lt;strong&gt;best gift ideas for programmers and developers&lt;/strong&gt;. I am sure your programmer friend or colleague will love any gift from this list. You can buy them for their birthday or gift them during the coming holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it's hard to choose a gift, but whatever time and effort you put into selecting a gift will be remembered forever by your friend if you keep their interest and needs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Animate on click with Javascript!</title>
      <author>Subhransu Patra</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 05:06:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/subhransuindia/animate-on-click-with-javascript-5ae8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/subhransuindia/animate-on-click-with-javascript-5ae8</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Merry Christmas&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous Chapter &lt;a href="https://inform-our-world.github.io/Saqha/CH%202.2"&gt;Chapter 2 (Part 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inform Our World &lt;a href="https://inform-our-world.github.io/"&gt;Link here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://subhransuindia.github.io/Subhransu%20Patra.html"&gt;My Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animation with js? Not too much tough but if you are new to javascript, like me, then at first it would be a  little bit difficult but with time, you would be coping up with it. So, lets start the topic of 'Animate on click with Javascript!'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First create a HTML file...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Animate on click with Javascript!&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta charset="utf-8"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
body {
  margin: 0;
}
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then add any tag such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It is upto you which tag you will use to animate...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Then create an &lt;code&gt;id=""&lt;/code&gt; for it. Let's name it just p. You can use anything...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p id="p"&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we need a button so that if we clicked on it, it would animate as per our needs...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Click to Animate&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;then in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag add &lt;code&gt;onclick=""&lt;/code&gt;. It is very much essential for onclick animation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button onclick="beyblade()"&amp;gt;Click to Animate&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have put &lt;code&gt;beyblade()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;onclick=""&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; is very much essential...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the body...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and in that add&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
function beyblade() {

}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The text after &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; will be the one you have written in &lt;code&gt;onclick=""&lt;/code&gt; i.e. I have written &lt;code&gt;onclick="beyblade()"&lt;/code&gt;, the same I will write after &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; i.e.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function beyblade() {
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, let's take the element that we take be &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. So to do this, implement..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
function beyblade() {
let x = document.getElementById("p")
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;then add the following component...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
function beyblade() {
let x = document.getElementById("p")
x.style.marginLeft = "300px"
x.style.transition = "1s"
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x.style.transition&lt;/code&gt; will create transitions and &lt;code&gt;1s&lt;/code&gt; will create timing for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can implement any css component in place of &lt;code&gt;marginLeft&lt;/code&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;x.style.color = red&lt;/code&gt; it will change the text color to red and &lt;code&gt;x.style.backgroundColor = blue&lt;/code&gt; will change the background color to blue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It  helps  us to create a hamburger menu also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is for today. I hope you liked the article and if you, then please notify me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Code..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Animate on click with Javascript!&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta charset="utf-8"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
body {
  margin: 0;
}
&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p id="p"&amp;gt;Hello World!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;button onclick="beyblade()"&amp;gt;Click to Animate&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;
function beyblade() {
let x = document.getElementById("p")
x.style.marginLeft = "300px"
x.style.transition = "1s"
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time. 😺&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2021 Wrapped</title>
      <author>Avneesh Agarwal</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/avneesh0612/2021-wrapped-3kb6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year has been so amazing, and I have done lots of stuff. So in this article, I am just gonna show everything that I did this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZLqrlwDs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o6wrgQPwbYWY8hwze/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZLqrlwDs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o6wrgQPwbYWY8hwze/giphy.gif" alt="GIF" width="480" height="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#january"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  January
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very new to coding, I knew a bit of HTML which I learned in school. I was watching youtube and randomly a video came in my recommendations about building a google clone with react and I started building it. I had never done CSS or React and jumped straight in to react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OvUKMnJp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640329719514/6KFGdlq-Q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OvUKMnJp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640329719514/6KFGdlq-Q.png" alt="image.png" width="571" height="740"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#february"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  February
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participated in a 5 day React.JS Netflix Challenge. In this challenge, I got to make a Netflix clone, help so many amazing people and I also secured third place! With this, I joined the &lt;a href="https://www.papareact.com/"&gt;Papafam&lt;/a&gt;. I won the challenge but I didn't really know about what was react and was just coding things from tutorials. Simply, I was stuck in tutorial hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7cZ2ndKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/HC2Sa7-gBIoAAAAM/fire-eyes.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7cZ2ndKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/HC2Sa7-gBIoAAAAM/fire-eyes.gif" alt="Elmo GIF" width="220" height="151"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#march"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  March
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started going through the course modules and learned the basics of React. It didn't make much sense at the beginning but it slowly began to make more sense. To get out of the tutorial hell I started building projects and the first one was a &lt;a href="https://avneeshtodo.netlify.app/"&gt;Todo App&lt;/a&gt;. I got stuck at various points but I asked some people for help and they helped very kindly :D. I was trying my best to get out of tutorial hell this month by building small projects on my own. Another app I built was a  &lt;a href="https://avneesh-weather-app.netlify.app/"&gt;weather app&lt;/a&gt;. This wasn't very good but I got to learn about APIs, CSS and so much more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sRjZcJK2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640347174641/mRHtpUmeS.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sRjZcJK2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640347174641/mRHtpUmeS.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="457"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#april"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  April
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my first internship at StackFusion which was even paid! This was a 3-month internship and a good opportunity for me to learn new things. I also wrote my first article on  &lt;a href="https://medium.com/sonny-sangha/how-to-build-google-sign-in-with-firebase-in-react-with-react-firebase-hooks-c327c80db25d"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. A lot was going on at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RN0X62er--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/xKUEjR8XMm4AAAAM/walter-crazy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RN0X62er--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/xKUEjR8XMm4AAAAM/walter-crazy.gif" alt="GIF" width="220" height="171"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#may"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  May
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May when I completed my first month at Stackfusion I was pretty tired because I was supposed to work for fixed hours every day and on the commands of someone else which was very new to me. On top of that, there was school 😭. But I kept on going 💪. I also wrote another &lt;a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/git-and-github-crash-course-b44f4885ff66"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tgMlSKPz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/_tT0mRfm0t8AAAAM/embarrassed-sad.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tgMlSKPz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/_tT0mRfm0t8AAAAM/embarrassed-sad.gif" alt="GIF" width="220" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#june"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  June
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed 2 months at the internship and it wasn't as hard as the second month because I was getting used to the environment. I also started learning Next.js and migrated the site I built for the company from plain react to Next.js. At the end of this internship, I had completed this &lt;a href="https://nextjs-dashboard-kotak.vercel.app/home"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty proud of how it came out :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tnxmQjWi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640350844362/OKU25hXbF.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tnxmQjWi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640350844362/OKU25hXbF.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="799"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hosted a coaching call in the PapFam community, where I taught about converting a dribble design to a website with tailwindCSS. And in terms of writing, I wrote 5 articles this month which was quite a lot for me at that time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#july"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  July
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the starting of July, I was relaxing for a bit. Into the second week, I started messing around with some new tech and learning new things! During the 3rd week of July a friend of mine, [Usman Sabuwala](&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxProgramming1"&gt;https://twitter.com/MaxProgramming1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;) told me that there is a hackathon being organized by &lt;a href="https://hashnode.com/"&gt;Hashnode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clerk.dev/"&gt;Clerk.dev&lt;/a&gt;. So I thought why not give it a try! I started seeing what is Clerk and wrote an &lt;a href="https://blog.avneesh.tech/mastering-clerk-authentication-with-the-nextjs-standard-setup"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about it too. Finally, I made  &lt;a href="https://blog.avneesh.tech/how-i-built-chatcube-with-nextjs-tailwindcss-clerk-and-firebase-and-a-walkthrough-of-the-app"&gt;ChatCube&lt;/a&gt; in about a week and it was the winner of the hackathon! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hfLBkt70--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640351914338/QCc8a3Ylg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hfLBkt70--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640351914338/QCc8a3Ylg.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="445"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#august"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  August
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August I participated in another hackathon where &lt;a href="https://blog.avneesh.tech/introducing-voyagger-connecting-people-changing-lives"&gt;Voyagger&lt;/a&gt; was born. I didn't win the hackathon but in the process of building it, I learned a lot and also got some amazing content for my blog! This was one of my most productive months and I managed to write 13 articles this month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rsEg4x9z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640352885692/IEp2N3E1X.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rsEg4x9z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640352885692/IEp2N3E1X.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="998"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#september"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  September
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September I started to create a new &lt;a href="https://www.avneesh.tech/"&gt;portfolio &lt;/a&gt; for myself from scratch with Next.js, TailwindCSS, typescript, and more fun stuff! In September hashnode was also organizing a BootCamp where I wrote 8 articles and learned so much more about technical writing! I also started to do some freelancing this month because I was getting quite some offers and I wanted to see how it feels doing freelance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BRBbQb-X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1282416/screenshots/2857106/media/d28ab6a43314785c26f2053903ee43cd.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BRBbQb-X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1282416/screenshots/2857106/media/d28ab6a43314785c26f2053903ee43cd.gif" alt="GIF" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#october"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  October
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October I was doing a big freelancing gig with my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sahilpabale"&gt;Sahil Pabale&lt;/a&gt; which was almost a month long. In parallel with this gig, I also took some small gigs on an hourly basis when I got time! Since October I also started to get more into open source especially due to hacktoberfest! I also won the &lt;a href="https://townhall.hashnode.com/oss-grant-badge-winners"&gt;OSS Symposium&lt;/a&gt;  organized by Hashnode!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NQ187ePJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/730703/screenshots/4624912/media/28b0b1bca891fcc3de540aa757f300a2.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NQ187ePJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/730703/screenshots/4624912/media/28b0b1bca891fcc3de540aa757f300a2.gif" alt="GIF" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#november"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  November
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November I was feeling a bit burned out and I also had my school exams 😬. So I didn't get much time to code but I somehow managed to write 3 articles to keep my mind fresh and keep it going! A good thing about this month was that I made a lot more open source contributions than I usually do. I would like to give &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddiejaoude"&gt;Eddie Jaoude&lt;/a&gt; a special mention for this as he and his community have inspired and helped me a lot with OSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lsvIQPq7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/so0ZNegFGWA7e/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lsvIQPq7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/so0ZNegFGWA7e/giphy.gif" alt="GIF" width="350" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#december"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  December
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my exams, I was back again! I decided to update some of my old side projects and make them better. I also made a &lt;a href="https://sponsor.avneesh.tech/"&gt;sponsors &lt;/a&gt; website for myself which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deninpaul_"&gt;Denin Paul&lt;/a&gt; designed for me! 🤯. December was probably one of the months where I was most active on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avneesh0612"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, so pretty proud of that! I also managed to write 8 articles this month which was pretty good in front of 3 😆.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ftWiEFEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media1.giphy.com/media/82l4DoL7zINwWjcI1j/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ftWiEFEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media1.giphy.com/media/82l4DoL7zINwWjcI1j/giphy.gif" alt="GIF" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this year has been great for me. Hope it was amazing for you too! Merry Christmas and a Happy New year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JIMDVx5V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/0PiXuGtqd5cAAAAC/merry-christmas-and-happy-new-year.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JIMDVx5V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://c.tenor.com/0PiXuGtqd5cAAAAC/merry-christmas-and-happy-new-year.gif" alt="GIF" width="380" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See ya next year ✌️🎉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jira Link Auto Commenter</title>
      <author>Bimochan Shrestha</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 03:42:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sbimochan/jira-link-auto-commenter-59lm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sbimochan/jira-link-auto-commenter-59lm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Migrating from bitbucket to Github made me lack only one feature. The link that navigates to its related Jira ticket from pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I created this tool for my project.&lt;br&gt;
This Github action auto comments in pull request with Jira link to it. This tool is helpful for devs who use consistent PR summary like &lt;code&gt;Ticket-1234: This is PR summary&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It grabs the ticket number using regex and comments on the PR by making a JIRA link. If it can't find the ticket number, it will fail silently and won't fail the whole workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a workflow file in root of your project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.github/workflows/main.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;custom-comment&lt;/code&gt;(optional): If you want to add your own comments before Jira link. Default is &lt;code&gt;Thank you for your contributions. Jira link:&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;jira-project-url&lt;/code&gt;: you can figure our this URL by going to any of your JIRA ticket in new tab and checking the URI box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;: is auto generated
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;example_comment_pr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Auto jira link commenter&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Checkout&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;actions/checkout@v1&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Comment PR&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;sbimochan/jira-link-commenter@v2.4&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="na"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;jira-project-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;https://jira.atlassian.net/browse&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;custom-comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Thank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;contribution!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;:confetti_ball:'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Public Solving: Earth, Fire, Snow game</title>
      <author>Chris Bongers</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 02:55:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/public-solving-earth-fire-snow-game-2p3i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/public-solving-earth-fire-snow-game-2p3i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The elves love making up games, and they have their own version of Rock, Paper, Scissor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their version includes Earth, Fire, and Snow.&lt;br&gt;
Let me quickly tell you how you can win with this game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire melts snow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snow covers earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earth extinguishes fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's get right into coding this fun game for the elves 👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/devadvent/puzzle-14"&gt;Click here to view the puzzle.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thinking-about-a-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thinking about a solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's safe to say there are only three options that win for this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a tie (both the same)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's actually all there is, and it makes our program a bit easier to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me show you how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-earth-fire-snow-game-in-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building the earth, fire, snow game in JavaScript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first define an object with the winning combinations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;winMatchUp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;snow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;snow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no need to define the other way around as we can abstract it, seeing we only have two players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at a draw. This means both players picked the same element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectWinner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we can check if user1's choice match up is equal to user2's choice. This would mean user 1 one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's me check an example to explain a bit more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user one picked snow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user two picked earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then query our match-up table and say give us the matchup object for &lt;code&gt;snow&lt;/code&gt;. This will return &lt;code&gt;earth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we now compare this to user two choice, we won!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our code we can do it like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;winMatchUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This automatically means, if user 1 did not win, user 2 must have won!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectWinner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;winMatchUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there you go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A super simple game, but yet so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've run the test as a sanity check, and they turn green ✅.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3ZlJ1RYr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639507909269/SgCLLxFAz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3ZlJ1RYr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639507909269/SgCLLxFAz.png" alt="All test green" width="612" height="292"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparing Memory Consumption of Delegated Event Listeners and Individual Event Listeners in Javascript </title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/mohamadharith/comparing-memory-consumption-of-delegated-event-listeners-and-individual-event-listeners-in-javascript-1l3e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article assumes the reader understands what is &lt;a href="https://javascript.info/event-delegation"&gt;event delegation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing"&gt;event bubbling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on a frontend project, being the amateur programmer that I am, I initially did not understand why my &lt;a href="https://github.com/si3nloong"&gt;HOD&lt;/a&gt; insisted that we handle events for long list of items by means of event delegation instead of attaching individual event listeners for each list item. After hearing his explanation and doing some readings, I came to an understanding that event delegation has several benefits in comparison to attaching individual event listeners to a long a list of items. Among the benefits are as follows:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Memory&lt;/strong&gt;: More event listeners means more memory consumption as the browser has to listen to more events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Code maintainability&lt;/strong&gt;: Event delegation improves code maintainability because events from multiple elements can be handled all in one place in contrary to handling them individually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sJzy0UVy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yo6knwcxa3oj2ipttbd2.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sJzy0UVy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yo6knwcxa3oj2ipttbd2.jpeg" alt="Drake Event Delegation" width="500" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in order to see the benefits of event delegation in terms of memory consumption before my own eyes, I have conducted an experiment where I wrote two HTML pages that each generated list of 100k items. For one of the lists I attached individual event listeners for each &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; element and and for the other list I attached a single delegated event listener on the &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; element. I then compared the memory consumption of these two pages using Firefox's task manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Event Listeners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onclick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Item &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegated Event Listeners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onclick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Item &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CocdH-iW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5rb2twtjyzsuuh87wil9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CocdH-iW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5rb2twtjyzsuuh87wil9.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="85"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, the memory consumption on the page that contains the list with individual event listeners was definitely higher than that of the list with delegated event listener. Therefore, it is proven that delegated event listener is more performant and should be used when listening to events from a large list of items.&lt;/p&gt;

  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling your home devices via the cloud can be so cool and not stressful. With you just picking up your phone and controlling your home device is something you should know much about. In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to control your DVD/ Home theater(Works the same way) via Tuya link SDK and ESP 32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we will be building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will learn how to control our DVD/ Home theater via Tuya link SDK and ESP32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ESP32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrared  led transmitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transistor Bc457&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ac/dc  5v power supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuya IoT platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuya smart App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arduino IDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command Prompt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Folksconnect123/DVD-CONTROL"&gt;https://github.com/Folksconnect123/DVD-CONTROL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Tuya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tuya Smart (NYSE: TUYA) is a global IoT development platform that creates interconnectivity standards to connect brands, OEMs, developers, and retailers across a variety of smart devices and industries. Tuya integrates many intelligent scenarios and smart devices by providing hardware development tools, integrating public cloud services, and giving an intelligent business development platform, all of which are based on the global public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qAEzqqr0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tspxmmxoka5mz72xzwsf.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qAEzqqr0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tspxmmxoka5mz72xzwsf.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Tuya link Sdk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tuya link SDK makes life a lot easier. It facilitates the creation of cloud development projects involving OpenAPI or message subscription capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuya Link SDK is one such SDK that encapsulates fundamental services like device activation, DP (Data-Points) upstream and downstream, and firmware OTA (Over-The-Air) upgrading into an interface. It is appropriate for connecting the logic services of a self-developed gadget to the cloud by developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RxNVBGPy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wr0okxz0f0vr5lm7i0wi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RxNVBGPy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wr0okxz0f0vr5lm7i0wi.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="357"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is ESP32?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The ESP32 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip by Espressif Systems that has built-in TCP/IP networking software and a microprocessor/ Microcontroller capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Setting up the environment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started let me give you a heads up that if you haven’t created a tuya account before do create because you will be given a free device license to create a hands-on project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Tuya Link SDK, we will need to make a product to interact and connect to Tuya IoT Cloud. Go to your Tuya IoT account and log in, if you haven't registered for an account register one &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://iot.tuya.com/?_source=3bb57e086a1738fc4d1ecf7a7f79188e"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a product by clicking on Create button on the home page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mRJLLnkk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8yrfpml40p0035vuubg5.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mRJLLnkk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8yrfpml40p0035vuubg5.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="405"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; A page will appear where you will need to select a category for your project or product, since we are using Esp32 as a custom device so we will need to click on “Can’t find the category” and enter the details as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w-MZ8Msh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mxb337zd5r5v1ip8bv5b.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w-MZ8Msh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mxb337zd5r5v1ip8bv5b.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="404"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; We need a standard function for the power state of the DVD (On/Off) and a custom function to be able to control the DVD like (open and close, Skip, Play, etc.). To create a standard function to either switch the DVD on/ off. Click on add and search for Switch then click Ok. Now you have to edit the name of the Switch for more clarity. You can rename it to DVD power _state. If done click on add again and search for Switch 2, then click ok. Also, rename it to Open/close. We also need to create a standard function for Play/pause. Click on add again. And search for switch then rename to Play/Pause. We need to create a custom function for skip (Note that we can also create a standard function for Skip.). On the custom function tab click on add, then set the Data-point to (SkipFor), the identifier to (skipfor) Datatype to (Bool), Data transfer type (Send only). Do the rest for the other function To know more about creating custom functions click on this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://iot.tuya.com/?_source=3bb57e086a1738fc4d1ecf7a7f79188e"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep note of the PID we will need it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuYM3y51--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rx8tg5nv1jzgjr0ycca9.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuYM3y51--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rx8tg5nv1jzgjr0ycca9.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="405"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; To interact with the device we need to have a beautiful Panel with all required functionalities, although you can drag and drop UI design in the Tuya design panel since we are working on a prototype and debugging I like to have things very quick I would click on the tuya DIY Style Panel. You can change it to your preference as soon as you are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to the Hardware Development Section of your product and click on Link SDK. You will need a license to be able to use link SDK, but don’t bother Tuya issues free licenses for new tech hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hr0pn0Xw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gkx7uut0zfbhbh4y8uyi.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hr0pn0Xw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gkx7uut0zfbhbh4y8uyi.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="368"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ESP32 we are going to use General CPU as a hardware type, also you would see an option to generate a free license if you are new to the platform. Click place the order and download the License list. The** license is composed of tuya UUID and AuthKey** which is needed to authorize the device to receive and send data to the Tuya Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are done with the major part of the software development for our Tuya IoT platform now we move to the setting up of the hardware and the implementation of our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-tuya-link-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Tuya Link SDK
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is time to install Tuya link SDK to be able to connect our just completed application above with ESP32. To do that we have to type this code on our command prompt in order to clone the GitHub repository and install tuya link SDK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: make sure you have Git installed on your pc. If you don’t you can download and install the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to type this code on the command prompt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/tuya/tuyaos-link-sdk-python.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second step is to install the tuya link SDK. Note you have to have wheel installed on your machine if you don’t have one. Install it using this line of code. If done, you can finally type the below code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install wheel 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install ./tuyaos-link-sdk-python
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we are done with the installation of the Tuya link SDK you should have this pop-up on your screen if due procedures are followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YJDpzGcR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jc50eb6mdj896vob0nc1.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YJDpzGcR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jc50eb6mdj896vob0nc1.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="451"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hardware-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hardware setup:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab your ESP32 and other required hardware projects we are ready to get our hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the required hardware items are complete. Follow the schematics of the hardware and make sure everything is connected properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For receiving the address use this schematic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You connect the Signal/Data pin of the infrared to D15 on the ESP. The anode of the reciever to 5v and the cathode to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--khS8BFYI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y8t8ysgsfdtz8d161wac.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--khS8BFYI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y8t8ysgsfdtz8d161wac.PNG" alt="Image description" width="875" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For sending the Address to the DVD use this schematic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You connect the base pin of the transistor to pin D4 on the ESP 32. The Collector pin of the transistor to ground. Then the Emitter to the cathode of the LED.Then the Anode of the led must be connected with 220 ohms resistor to Vin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_yFiw_vS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ccmia6vrmo8xqnff8g2.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_yFiw_vS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ccmia6vrmo8xqnff8g2.PNG" alt="Image description" width="875" height="456"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementing-your-program"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementing your Program
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-the-address-from-the-remote"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting the address from the remote.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have gotten to this level, the next step to be done is to implement the code. Download the  IRremote_decode file from the Git hub account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now run the IRremote_decode file and open the Serial monitor to get the address from your Remote after that you can now modify the DVD_control file to input the address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the hardware schematics for the remote decoder address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ESP32 connect the Signal pin of the IR receiver to 15 and the Positive pin to 5v, the last pin to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7HrZij1d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5c9lflxugwyabhyihdhb.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7HrZij1d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5c9lflxugwyabhyihdhb.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="404"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the address from my remote controller. Then I have inserted the address into the DVD code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifying the DVD_Control file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve gotten the address you can now modify the DVD_control file from GitHub to your own address like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Bs-ggWC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zfvxoh5rbcqrcavme3xt.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Bs-ggWC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zfvxoh5rbcqrcavme3xt.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="336"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run the file and test the code via the serial monitor with your DVD on to see if everything is going perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finalizing-our-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finalizing our work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve successfully uploaded and run the above code it is time to control our microcontroller via the cloud. Now Download the TuyaLinkSDk file from GitHub and modify the code for your PID, Auth key and UUID, and the COM port of your microcontroller. After those are done then you can now run the code on your command prompt by using the cd method. Like in my own case I copied the file to the desktop, then I typed this on my command prompt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd desktop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you type the name of the file. In my own case TuyaLinkSDK.py&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VALZ7IYP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y4hc5jpdodqdp6n2g6y0.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VALZ7IYP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y4hc5jpdodqdp6n2g6y0.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have this after you’ve successfully run the code. Now you can download the Tuya smart app from Playstore and click on add new device, then scan the code to add the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AALmDMaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8i1m5r3r6hu2zuu9b6pr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AALmDMaR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8i1m5r3r6hu2zuu9b6pr.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sS7KC-4Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tlh512oes06qgk1c6roh.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sS7KC-4Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tlh512oes06qgk1c6roh.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="386"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom Build folder for React</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will learn how to change the Build path of a React application. Here I'm using a shell script for moving the contents inside the build folder to another location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;{file-name}.sh&lt;/strong&gt; file inside the root directory of your react app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open to your &lt;strong&gt;package.json&lt;/strong&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just beneath the build script, add a new one called "&lt;strong&gt;postbuild&lt;/strong&gt;" with a value "./{file-name}.sh".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;if you are using Windows, use bash before executing the script.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--veM76Egl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6wu9ivyubo0hd3p1osbl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--veM76Egl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6wu9ivyubo0hd3p1osbl.png" alt="Image description" width="416" height="173"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shell script is executed right after the build process, and the actual magic happens inside the shell script.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#If the folder exists, remove it first, then copy the files
if [ -d "./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/" ]; then

    rm -rv ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/*
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/

#Else make a new folder and then move the files.
else
    mkdir -p ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}
    mv -v build/* ./../server/public/${APP_NAME}/
fi

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my case, I just wanted to move the build folder contents to my server folder.&lt;br&gt;
Before moving the content inside the build folder, I checked whether the output folder was already exiting. If there is a folder, I want to clean it first and move the contents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script can be customized to your need. Just go through some simple shell-script tutorials. Here what is helping us is the '&lt;strong&gt;postbuild&lt;/strong&gt;' script that will be automatically executed after the build command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
