      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job as a developer can be a daunting prospect especially if you’re coming from a self-taught background. For many junior developers starting their first job may evoke feelings of excitement as well as inadequacy. The feelings of inadequacy are commonly termed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This is common for experienced as well as inexperienced developers, and these feelings are usually the result of working in a complex and constantly changing landscape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much to learn it’s almost impossible to understand all of it in any detail. Feelings of imposter syndrome can be even more intense for those just starting out in the industry because, well, they’re new to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first job as a junior developer is an important one. Mainly because this experience can ultimately determine whether this career path is for you or not. As a junior developer, it is up to you to ensure you do what it takes to make the most of this opportunity and experience. You’ve already cleared the first, hardest hurdle, you’ve managed to teach yourself how to code and now you’ve bagged yourself a job. Your next hurdle is surviving your first 6-12 months as a junior developer. This will be a challenging experience, but if you approach it the right way it will be an incredibly rewarding one, and you’ll learn a heck of a lot. Based on my own experiences during my first year as a junior front-end developer, I’ve compiled my 5 top tips for acing your first 12 months as a junior developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-prepare-for-a-mindfork" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Prepare for a mindfork
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, there’s no polite way of putting this. You will be experiencing information overload on a daily basis (this never really stops but it tends to calm down as you gain more experience and settle into a job). This can be pretty overwhelming, and alongside the other conventions that come with a new job - like getting to know a new surrounding, new co-workers, processes, and coffee machines - things can get on top of you really quickly - but only if you let them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing yourself for this can go a long way toward helping you handle and cope with the rate of information overload. Aside from merely preparing yourself, here are a few approaches I took to handle this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-notes-in-a-markdown-file" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep notes in a markdown file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep a markdown file noting key pieces of information that would be wise for you to remember. Using markdown is cool because you can easily format your notes and they can live in your text editor so you can easily reach them when you're coding. Your notes can be codebase specific, they could relate to technologies the company/project uses - they can even be company-specific such as payroll and time tracking information, even where to find the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ask-for-direction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ask for direction
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a senior developer or your mentor which areas of information you should be focusing on. You are effectively asking for help to streamline this information overload so you can process and learn the key parts. An experienced developer will have the context and foresight to direct you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-communicate" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Communicate
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like the standard tip of ‘be good at communicating’. But honestly, as a junior developer your communication skills are just as, if not more important, than your technical ability. Often, because you feel embarrassed that you might not know something and you’re hyper-aware that you feel out of your depth, it becomes tempting to silo yourself and hide away when you’re completely stuck on something - eventually, you might decide to ask for help begrudgingly. The problem is, if you don’t tell your co-workers or boss when things are hard or when you’re stuck then you risk shooting yourself and possibly your team in the foot. You won't help yourself and you won't allow your team and co-workers to help you. For instance, if you put off asking a question regarding a task that you do not understand you may end up blocked by this for a long time which may have been fixed really quickly if only you’d asked. The repercussions could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your team might miss a sprint goal or particular objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be perceived as underperforming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as you keep communicating you’ll allow yourself to progress at a much faster rate and you’ll allow your co-workers to help you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-be-enthusiastic" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Be enthusiastic
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a junior developer, you’ve been hired under the premise that you have little to no experience and you will require extensive training and development. Although there isn’t huge (there shouldn’t be) pressure on you to perform and be highly productive at this stage, this is still a crucial time, and you should be looking to show enthusiasm for what you’re doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm is a fairly broad term so we can refine this a little more with a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to jump out of your comfort zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eagerness to learn new languages and technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to lend a hand even if you haven’t been asked to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your fellow developers are way more likely to want to invest time in you and your progression because of this. Helping you to improve benefits the whole team not just you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-ask-good-questions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Ask good questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one seems a little silly but is in fact a skill in itself. Being able to ask good questions is incredibly important for all developers, especially juniors. Naturally, being new to the industry and new to a job you’ll have a ton of questions that you will want to and &lt;strong&gt;need to ask&lt;/strong&gt;. Inevitably, if you’re constantly nagging the developer next to you with questions there’s a high chance this will become annoying for them - especially if you’re asking questions in a certain way. It helps to follow a few key question asking rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prove-youve-tried" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prove you've tried
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before asking make sure you’ve actually spent some time trying to answer it yourself. This is especially poignant for coding questions. It might help to actually write down what approach you have taken, what issues you’ve encountered, and what you think the solution might be. When you ask, you can go over each of these points and whoever you’re asking is way more likely to want to help you because this shows you’ve actively made an effort to solve something independently. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t get this h3 to center inside this div”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'm struggling to center an H3 element horizontally and vertically inside a div. I’ve tried to use flexbox to do this. I have applied the flex display property along with justify-content and align-items center properties to the containing div but that hasn’t worked. I think it may be something to do with specificity. I’ve taken a look at the stylesheet but I’m struggling to find where the styles I’m applying are being overridden - if at all. Would you be able to point me in the right direction please?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#batch-your-questions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Batch your questions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the middle ground between asking questions too quickly and waiting too long to ask. Again, this is more relevant for coding specific questions. If you ask too quickly, you risk annoying the person you’re asking. And if you leave it too long you risk wasting company time and money. Seems like a catch-22, but there is a balance to strike - you’ll just have to work at it to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking lots of questions is fine, but distracting the developer next to you with five questions in less than 10 minutes might be quite frustrating for them. Especially as &lt;a href="https://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity"&gt;context switching&lt;/a&gt; is a massive productivity drain for developers so it helps to be mindful of this. Instead, try to group/batch multiple questions together - you’ll find a lot of them will be related in some way too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t let my advice put you off asking questions! Developers like to have their egos stroked (at least a little), so asking them about things they probably already know will usually result in you learning something valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-find-a-mentor" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Find a mentor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re lucky, maybe you'll be assigned a mentor at your new job. If so, then great! Please make use of them, they will likely have a wealth of knowledge surrounding not only the development side of things but also domain/company-specific knowledge that will help you settle in and progress in your role. I’d really encourage you to ask about this before starting your new position. Having a point of contact and someone to go to for questions regarding your progression and any pain points is really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have access to a mentor, all is not lost. If you play your cards right, often the more experienced developers you work with will become your de-facto mentors - especially if you’ve built a strong working relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer you will always be required to learn new things, it’s the nature of the job. However, this learning experience is intensified for a junior developer given there is so much to learn and adapt to. It’s not just the new frameworks, libraries, and languages but it’s also working in a cross-functional team, working with other developers, working with a client, or with a business product. These things are really tough to become good at if you’ve never had a job as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately you need to be willing to step out of your comfort zone. Be enthusiastic about it and make sure you communicate your progress (or lack of). This will enhance your learning and rate of progression, ensuring your experience as a newly hired developer is a positive and rewarding one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Improved My CSS Skills</title>
      <author>Shahed Nasser</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 14:19:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shahednasser/how-i-improved-my-css-skills-3847</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shahednasser/how-i-improved-my-css-skills-3847</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally posted on &lt;a href="https://blog.shahednasser.com/how-i-improved-my-css-skills/"&gt;my personal blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I had just gotten employed at my job and we were going through an in between projects and contacts phase. Basically, as a developer, I was bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to waste my time, so I decided to improve my CSS skills. Back then CSS for me was what I couldn't do with Bootstrap. It was just simple properties I added here and there. So, I decided I'd up my game by looking up challenges online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suggested Read: &lt;a href="https://blog.shahednasser.com/css-variables-and-how-to-use-them/"&gt;CSS Variables and How to Use Them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codepen-challenges" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Codepen Challenges
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place I went to for challenges was &lt;a href="https://codepen.io"&gt;Codepen&lt;/a&gt;. Codepen has a new theme of challenges every month, and every week of that month there would be a challenge revolving around the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge I did was for a ghosts challenge (It was October at the time and the theme was Halloween).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/NOGYLO?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty lame to be completely honest. But, with time I moved on to something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/xQpBJb?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/EdyrRX?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it, I found these two so hard to do. My skills were so much lacking that designing a table with a hover effect seemed like it was too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codepen was not enough though, as the challenges were just once a week and I needed to do more. So, I had to look through other challenges online.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#daily-css-images" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Daily CSS Images
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/MeFoDy/067daabf9c3ea0e554f045fc067e23b0"&gt;Daily CSS Images&lt;/a&gt; takes a more fun approach at learning CSS. Basically, everyday you create a certain object or animal, but with CSS. At the time I thought "how would learning how to make a bear be helpful?" but after time I realized that it's not about what you were making, it's about how you make it and what you learn in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I made a bear with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/bmgZdO?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned how to use &lt;code&gt;rotate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; through this one. I remember I was so confused trying to make the ears in particular. After I was done though, I felt so proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one I did was a clock. Now this one I needed a tutorial to help me because I didn't know how to make the clock hands move without Javascript. Before doing this, I thought it was impossible to do it with only CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/wYpJdP?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through making this one it was my first time even hearing about transform-origin. I also expanded my knowledge a lot by using transform and animations. This one was a big step up for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did an elephant, a beaver, a jellyfish, and a rose. Daily CSS Images Challenge helped me understand more about animations and transforms and perspective in CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily CSS Images Challenge also helped me step up my CodePen Challenges game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/VVPYLK?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these challenges helped, I needed to move on to something more realistic. A challenge where I would make something that I would actually make in a real project.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#100-days-css-challenge" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  100 Days CSS Challenge
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://100dayscss.com/"&gt;100 Days CSS Challenge&lt;/a&gt; was my favorite challenge to be a part of. First off, their website featured the works of developers who participated on CodePen, so it was a nice boost for me. Also, their challenges looked so beautiful to me, and in a lot of cases, something I'd love to do on a next project of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge I did was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/wYJxvx?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple grid of images that shows a heart on hover. Yes, it is simple, but again because I lacked in my skills it was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did this Search bar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/XxOPOQ?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this counter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/PygOzB?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, all simple concepts, but it was still really helpful. I learned how to make prettier designs. CSS isn't just about knowing how to do something or memorizing the properties, it's also about utilizing what you know to make a visually pleasing design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges also had Javascript in them so it was helpful to practice Javascript as well.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codevember" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Codevember
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge I took on as well was &lt;a href="http://codevember.xyz/"&gt;Codevember&lt;/a&gt;. Codevember ran from 2016 till 2019, and it would show a list of challenges for every day in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codevember's challenges were simple. Each day would have a keyword and you have to create something that relates to it. This helps shift  your perspective from just coding with CSS to using your imagination to find an idea, then think how would I bring this idea to life with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, at first when the concept was Infinity, I took a pretty simple approach to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/eQZGbX?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the concept was Web, I made a spider sitting on a web (with the help of SVG):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/shahednasser/embed/pQNRKO?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helped me think more creatively and then try to find a way to do it with CSS, while maintaining what I learned from 100 Days CSS Challenge to make it visually pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that to improve your skill in any programming language, you need to practice. Even if it seems hard in the beginning, with time you will improve and you will learn new concepts and ways of thinking as well. Whether it's CSS or any other programming language, look online for motivating challenges to keep you going and practicing to become a better developer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JWT Authorization and Authentication, Node, Express, and Vue</title>
      <author>Kevin Odongo</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 12:49:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kevin_odongo35/jwt-authorization-and-authentication-node-express-and-vue-2p8c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kevin_odongo35/jwt-authorization-and-authentication-node-express-and-vue-2p8c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we are going to add authentication and authorizations to our blog application that we have been using in our previous tutorials. We are going to use two options Passport or JWT. In today's will handle JWT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing I also read other people's articles and what's interesting will always save to my reading list. This article explains extensible about JWT. I don't need to add more to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kmistele/demystifying-jwt-how-to-secure-your-next-web-app-9h0"&gt;https://dev.to/kmistele/demystifying-jwt-how-to-secure-your-next-web-app-9h0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#as-of-me-during-my-learning-im-always-curious-to-know-how-to-implement-what-i-have-read-practically-to-an-application" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  As of me during my learning, I'm always curious to know how to implement what I have read practically to an application.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have learned so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach of MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node still falls under serverless because we are currently running our application without managing the infrastructure. Atlas is managing everything for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach of AWS PostgreSQL, Express, Vue, and Node falls under the server approach because we are currently running our application in an EC2. We will have to manage the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach of AWS MySQL, Express, Vue, and Node falls under the server approach because we are currently running our application in an EC2. We will have to manage the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a startup, maintaining servers will be quite costly and therefore a consideration between Containers and serverless would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us add the following components to the authentication directory in the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loginvue" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Login.vue
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---lwpVx0d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ugcnpy7qsz76gdt039fa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---lwpVx0d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ugcnpy7qsz76gdt039fa.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#signupvue" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yxtRw0mo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pgxzorm7s9t54xd36729.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yxtRw0mo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pgxzorm7s9t54xd36729.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we only want to allow GET articles API for public viewing of articles. The rest of the CRUD actions will only be allowed after authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Backend
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you followed our previous tutorial then currently you know we have two applications backend running on Node, Express, Mongo DB OR PostgreSQL OR MySQL depending on the database you selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to add authentication and authorization to this application. We will assume as follows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to allow only GET for the following routes to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to allow DELETE to the admin role everything else can be assessed by admin or user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is how our blog.js in the routes folder will be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../controller/blog.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../authentication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// /api/blog: GET, POST, DELETE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// /api/blog/:id: GET, PUT, DELETE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// /api/blog/published: GET&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create a new blog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Retrieve all blog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Retrieve all published blog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findAllPublished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Retrieve a single blog with id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Update a blog with id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Delete a blog with id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create a new blog&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deleteAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will need two roles in our blog. A user and admin. &lt;br&gt;
For token, you can use either jsonwebtoken or express.jwt. Let us install bcryptjs to hash our password and jsonwebtoken for our token.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexjs" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  index.js
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the index.js file when our backend application loads we would want to check our database if the roles have been set correctly, if empty we need to create the roles. Let us have an initialization function to handle checking on the roles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// reference the Role DB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;estimatedDocumentCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;added 'user' to roles collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;added 'admin' to roles collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below is the result when you first run your backend. We did not have the roles and it initialized the roles table and added the new roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VDImwddn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1z8o5yyczp1vgkk4vtft.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VDImwddn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1z8o5yyczp1vgkk4vtft.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#routes" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  routes
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to add a new route called auth.js in the routes folder and update the blog routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;auth.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This route will handle two functions signup and signin. The function &lt;strong&gt;verify_user_email&lt;/strong&gt; assists in checking if the email has been registered before to avoid duplication.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;verify_user_email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../authentication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../controller/auth.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/signin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/signup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;verify_user_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkDuplicateUsernameOrEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;verify_user_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkRolesExisted&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blog.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have shared above how our blog.js routes folder should be.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../authentication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../controller/user.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allaccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// all access&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// user access&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth_jwt_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// admin access&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is all we have to do in the routes folder. Next, we need to update the index.js file and import our routes. With express.js you can load application-level and router-level middleware with an optional mount path. You can also load a series of middleware functions together, which creates a sub-stack of the middleware system at a mount point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// routes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./app/routes/blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// blog routes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./app/routes/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// user authentication&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;x-access-token, Origin, Content-Type, Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// user authorization&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;x-access-token, Origin, Content-Type, Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// auth authentication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope we are on the same page at this stage. Keep close&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#schema" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Schema
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us define the schema for the user and the roles. This will be done in the model's folder where we had the blog schema too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;role.model.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our roles will have a name and an id.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;timestamps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;user.model.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the user model, we want to add username, email, password, and roles for the user. By default, the user will have a user role and upgraded to admin thereafter.&lt;br&gt;
Note we have referenced the Role so we can get the correct id for the roles.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mongoose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ObjectId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;timestamps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#controller" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  controller
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the controller folder let us add a controller that will handle authentication&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;auth.controller.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The signup function will create a new user while the signing function will confirm the user exists. Then the user payload will be signed by the private key and a token will be generated. To verify the token we can verify the signature and decode with jwt or just decode jwt token. We will handle both scenarios.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;crypto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;crypto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;crypto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;SHA256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// sign username&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;expiresIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;86400&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 24 hours&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ROLE_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authorities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// access token&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// signature&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us create an authentication folder in the app folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch /app/authentication
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then create three files index.js, auth.js, and verify.js. verify.js will handle the verification of the user email while the auth.js will handle the verification of the user token and if the user is an admin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authjs" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  auth.js
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;jsonwebtoken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verifyToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;x-access-token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;x-access-signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;403&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;No token provided!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Prints: true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;decoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us test our backend and ensure we have configured everything correctly. I will be using Postman to test the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up a user with no admin access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign in a user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a blog (Token will be required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete a blog (Token and admin access will be required) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/exQGCc8LcZ4"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#front-end" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Front End
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us configure the front end and link the communication between the two. Let us create a file called auth.script.js in the components directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On sign-in success, we need to ensure we save the user details safely. Here is an article about how to securely save your payloads securely. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/gkoniaris/how-to-securely-store-jwt-tokens-51cf"&gt;https://dev.to/gkoniaris/how-to-securely-store-jwt-tokens-51cf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logout function should clear the storage and redirect the user back to the login page or home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sign-up" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sign up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sign-up component add the following function in your method section and call it on user submit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import the signup function from auth.script.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// sibmit signup&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;User was registered successfully!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// DO NOT USE LOCAL STORAGE&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dashboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// error&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#login" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Login
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the login component add the following function in your method section and call it on user submit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import the login function from auth.script.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// sibmit login&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// DO NOT USE LOCAL STORAGE&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/dashboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// error&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#log-out" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  log out
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dashboard update the logout function by adding a way of clearing the user information you had saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// DO NOT USE LOCAL STORAGE
localStorage.removeItem("user")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NOTE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every request in the blog routes that requires authentication ensure your header contains the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Content-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;x-access-token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;x-access-signature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signature&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally in your router guard all the routes in your vue application. In the router folder ensure you update the index.js file as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VueRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;belongsToMany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user_roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ROLES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everything else will stay as I have detailed above. Just edit the following files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sending-code-for-confirmation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SENDING CODE FOR CONFIRMATION
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can implement this by using different products but I would recommend AWS SES. I once talked about how to configure AWS SES &lt;a href="https://dev.to/kevin_odongo35/build-a-bulk-email-and-sms-app-with-vue-and-aws-ses-aws-sns-or-twilio-part-1-33jp"&gt;https://dev.to/kevin_odongo35/build-a-bulk-email-and-sms-app-with-vue-and-aws-ses-aws-sns-or-twilio-part-1-33jp&lt;/a&gt;. The whole logic I will detail in a course. From start to end. Keep close&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this tutorial has been helpful in how to implement JWT. I have provided articles to assist you in understanding more about JWT. How to securely to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Introduction To Svelte</title>
      <author>Oliver Jumpertz</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/oliverjumpertz/an-introduction-to-svelte-4g48</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Svelte has recently topped the satisfaction rankings of "State of JS 2020" and this justifies an introduction for everyone still not aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-svelte" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Svelte?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Svelte is a component-based frontend framework like React and Vue, that promises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No virtual DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True reactivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and delivers on all of these pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It currently has 41.2k stars on GitHub and an active community, including 359 contributors. The community is pretty active and unlike React, there is no huge corporation backing it. But no need to worry, Svelte won't vanish anytime soon. The project is licensed under the MIT license and was initially released on November 26, 2016, by Rich Harris, its creator. Svelte itself is implemented in TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike React or Vue, Svelte doesn't use a virtual DOM. Instead, it comes with a compiler that parses your code and emits code that precisely updates the DOM. This means that no diffing needs to take place, anymore. Only gradual DOM updates which a browser can handle pretty well. And this compiler can do even more.  Svelte doesn't need hooks to update a component's state. A simple, plain JavaScript statement is enough. That statement is then compiled into something that actually handles state changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like React has its *.jsx files, and Vue has its *.vue single-file components, Svelte has *.svelte files. And similar to single-file components in Vue, a svelte file can contain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a look at this sample component:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello Svelte!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{greeting}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To give you an example of Svelte's built-in reactivity, take a look at the component shown below. No (React) hooks, no redux, no state-management library, only plain JavaScript and a directive. This is the power of the Svelte compiler. What you see is relatively trivial code, but it's enough to make the outcome fully reactive. The same functionality in React would take you more code to write.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#4CAF50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;32px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;on:click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;{handleClick}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Clicked {count} {count === 1 ? "time" : "times"}
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are also more advanced features, like lifecycle-hooks and conditional rendering (which isn't plain JS anymore) which open up more use-cases. If you, for example, want to render a block for each entry in an array, below is how you do it with Svelte.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;12345&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;23456&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;34567&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  { #each entries as { id, entry }, i }
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{id}: {entry}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  { /each }
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's not plain JavaScript, anymore, but it's still a readable syntax that is necessary for the compiler to be able to process it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-makes-svelte-so-powerful" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What makes Svelte so powerful?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplicity and the power that comes with Svelte's approach make it so powerful. Virtual-DOM implementations made single-page applications remarkable, but they come at a cost. Diffing the virtual DOM and the actual DOM, and then applying gradual changes at runtime costs performance and sometimes brings complexity. Moving all this into a compile-step and then letting the browsers do what they are good at (managing the DOM) makes your apps faster, and your bundle-sizes lower. What you deliver is your frontend code, and a lot less library/framework weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and do you still remember the reactive example? Here is how the emitted JavaScript code looks. That's a lot of burdens taken off your back and put onto the compiler's shoulder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* App.svelte generated by Svelte v3.32.1 */&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SvelteComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Can you recall all those integration libraries that make many other libraries compatible with the virtual DOM? Yes, I know that you don't always need those. But with Svelte, you'll never need them, because there simply is no virtual DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-it-worth-a-try" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is it worth a try?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it's definitely worth a try. It is a fresh approach to a common problem, which tries to put a lot of effort into making things simpler for developers. The official documentation is awesome, with a great tutorial going over every important feature. It's written very well and makes it easy to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you happen to have some spare time, maybe try it out, it may well be worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Authentication vs. Authorization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will be going over two concepts people tend to confuse in the world of identity and access management. Simply put, authentication validates that users are who they say they are, while authorization permits those users to access a resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-authentication" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Authentication?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication is the process of validating that users are who they claim to be. Passwords are one of the most common ways to authenticate a user on a system. If the username matches the password provided by the user, it means the identity is valid, and the system proceeds to grant access to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ways of authenticating users include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-time pins (OTP) - These grant access for only one session or transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication apps - They generate security codes via an outside party that grants access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biometrics - Here, a user presents a fingerprint or eye scan to gain access to the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some systems might require the successful verification of more than one authentication factor before granting a user access. This is called two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is often used to increase security beyond what passwords alone can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-authorization" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Authorization?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorization is the process of giving a user permission to access a specific resource or function in a system. This term is often used interchangeably with access control or client privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular authorization techniques include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role-based access controls (RBAC) - They can be implemented for system-to-system and user-to-system privilege management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON web token (JWT) - This is an open standard for securely transmitting data between parties, and users are authorized using a public/private key pair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAML - This is a standard Single Sign-On format (SSO). Here, authentication information is exchanged through XML documents that are digitally signed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenID authorization - This verifies user identity based on an authorization server’s authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OAuth - This allows an API to authenticate and access a requested system or resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we will talk about the techniques that I used to speed up my very own website. I was quite curious about what tricks people were using to optimize their&lt;br&gt;
blogs, portfolios to increase user experience. And, I'm wickedly obsessed when it comes to optimization. So I look further to see if there were any ways to optimize like&lt;br&gt;
reducing bundle sizes, optimizing google fonts, using different bundles for the development environment and production environment, tricks to utilize for custom fonts.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, here we're, on an optimized website refering to [ogzhanolguncu.com] &lt;a href="http://ogzhanolguncu.com/"&gt;http://ogzhanolguncu.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Let's first see the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GTmetrix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CMtcT00M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hr2ackfqb4fxhi6k8x8z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CMtcT00M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hr2ackfqb4fxhi6k8x8z.png" alt="gtmetrix-site-performance"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, there isn't much to squeeze out in terms of performance. Now, we will dissect these process step-by-step and see how to achieve a score like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fonts" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fonts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-safe-fonts" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Safe Fonts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're aiming for the best you can get, do not even consider using anything but browsers &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Safe Fonts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. By &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Safe Fonts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arial (sans-serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verdana (sans-serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helvetica (sans-serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tahoma (sans-serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times New Roman (serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Georgia (serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garamond (serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courier New (monospace)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brush Script MT (cursive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are highly accessible fonts pretty much for all the browsers since they already installed on your computer,&lt;br&gt;
so prioritize them over &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/"&gt;Google Web Fonts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/"&gt;Adobe Fonts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#font-display" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Font Display
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ExampleFont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url(/path/to/fonts/examplefont.woff)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'woff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url(/path/to/fonts/examplefont.eot)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'eot'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;font-display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;optional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;unicode-range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0020-007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0100-017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;font-display&lt;/code&gt; plays a huge role for &lt;strong&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)&lt;/strong&gt; and of course for the performance. So, best to go with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; for performance and &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; for decrease &lt;strong&gt;CLS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported by all modern browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unicode-ranges" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unicode Ranges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifying the &lt;code&gt;unicode-ranges&lt;/code&gt; beforehand tells the browsers to only download necessary characters that going to be used. Since we don't need characters&lt;br&gt;
like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, etc. Of course, if you are not using those characters 🙂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported by all modern browsers. See the list for &lt;a href="https://jrgraphix.net/research/unicode_blocks.php"&gt;unicodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preloading" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preloading
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/fonts/Avenir-Roman.ttf"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;as=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"font"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"font/ttf"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"preload"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;crossorigin=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"anonymous"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;preload&lt;/code&gt; means that you will need this font very soon after page loading, so load them first and then move onto others, before browsers' main rendering&lt;br&gt;
kicks in. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;preload&lt;/code&gt; does not block the page's render and improves overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#google-fonts" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Google Fonts
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"preconnect"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://fonts.gstatic.com"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&amp;amp;display=swap"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using Google fonts always use &lt;code&gt;preconnect&lt;/code&gt; first, the browser will start a new connection between origin and receiver to make things faster,&lt;br&gt;
thus improving our websites' user experience and speed. And, pick the &lt;code&gt;font-weights&lt;/code&gt; you need because more &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt; means bigger file to download, so choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#images" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Images
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are not much to talk about images but always strive for smaller images you can get. For example, the image on my landing page is only 50kb, by the way, this is&lt;br&gt;
the smallest it can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://tinypng.com/"&gt;TinyPng&lt;/a&gt; to compress your images without losing quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-alternative-packages" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Alternative Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this website runs on React only way to decrease the bundle size was to use &lt;a href="https://preactjs.com/"&gt;Preact&lt;/a&gt; 3kB alternative for React.&lt;br&gt;
If you are using Webpack as a bundler like me, you can follow the steps to implement this. By the way, I'm using preact for the production version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, install preact &lt;code&gt;yarn add preact&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, configure your webpack bundler as shown below.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;webpack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isServer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;preact/compat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-dom/test-utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;preact/test-utils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;preact/compat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from that example, you also analyze your packages through Google Lighthouse, which offers alternative smaller packages for current ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DiS3Yqpy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/z81allp7svbvrtelo796.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DiS3Yqpy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/z81allp7svbvrtelo796.jpg" alt="recommend-alternative-package"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unused-dependencies" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unused Dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look through your dependencies inside &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, locate and delete unused ones. Because even if you don't use packages in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; they will still&lt;br&gt;
be inside your final bundle, thus will make your bundle bigger, therefore make it load slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#staying-up-to-date-with-dependencies" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Staying Up To Date With Dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying up to date with the latest dependencies may seem unnecessary at first, but sometimes developers improve their packages in terms of both speed and size. For example, Next.js 10's core packages have been reduced by 16%. They introduced a code-splitting strategy. All these happened because they added&lt;br&gt;
their built-in Image component to the codebase. Before they have introduced this image component, I was using an external package to use images. I've omitted this one right away once I upgraded to Next.js 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;em&gt;Web Safe Fonts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Preload&lt;/code&gt; your font file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preconnect to &lt;em&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;font-display: optional&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;font-display: swap&lt;/code&gt; for performance and CLS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use only &lt;code&gt;unicode-range&lt;/code&gt; you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not include &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt; you don't need to &lt;em&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compress your images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use smaller alternative packages for your production bundle, such as &lt;em&gt;Preact&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove unused dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay up to date with dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for reading 🥳🥳🥳.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Text live update with Javascript </title>
      <author>DevLorenz0</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 09:40:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devlorenzo/text-live-update-with-javascript-jd3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devlorenzo/text-live-update-with-javascript-jd3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello World!&lt;/code&gt; Today I will explain to you how to have a cool Text live update with Javascript (When user types text update in no time). Since I don't want to do a too-long article I will only focus on core functionality. Even so, I also want to show you some cool tricks at the end. But we've enough talked, now let's focus on the funniest, the code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#text-live-update-with-javascript" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Text live update with Javascript:
&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-of-all-html" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First of all: HTML
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class="autoUpdateText"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;form action="/profile" id="form"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type="text" id="input" placeholder="Write here"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use a form input cause you can easily style it how you need. It's also easier to handle in Javascript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about HTML form input read &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devlorenzo/the-fabulous-list-of-all-form-input-types-48ig"&gt;this cool article&lt;/a&gt; (I recommend you to open it on a new page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-time-css-is-crucial-we-all-agree-that-basic-html-inputs-are-awful-and-repellent" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This time CSS is crucial. We all agree that basic HTML inputs are awful and repellent
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we style containers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  font-family: "Alatsi", sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  background: white;
  color: black;
}

#form {
  margin-top: 50px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-content: center;
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then text area (input) and text that will follow the input:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#input {
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: center;
  vertical-align: middle;
  width: 600px;
  height: 200px;
  color: #444;
  font-size: 8em;
  background-color: #ddd;
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.autoUpdateText {
  display: inline-block;
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: 3.5em;
  line-height: 1em;
  font-family: monospace;
}

.autoUpdateText:hover {
  border-bottom: 0.15em solid white;
// Add here some style on hover
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-but-not-least-the-star-of-the-show-javascript" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last but not least, the star of the show, Javascript:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes you're right, I used the same sentence &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devlorenzo/js-change-text-on-hover-3945"&gt;on this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the party, let's Caching the DOM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that caching your DOM elements dramatically improves the speed of your code execution. This is clearly seen when comparing tests 3 and 4 where you get a boost from 32,889 to 602,620 operations per second. &lt;a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-performance-dom-caching/#:~:text=The%20results%20show%20that%20caching,to%20602%2C620%20operations%20per%20second!"&gt;Site Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const input = document.querySelector("#input");
const h1 = document.querySelector(".autoUpdateText");
const form = document.querySelector("#form");
countLetters = 0;
maxLineCharacters = 78;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will see soon why I created countLetters and maxLineCharacters variables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will add two event listener, first a prevent default to handle a possible user click on Enter:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;form.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then  an input event listener, everytime user enter a new letter code will run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;input.addEventListener("input", function (e) {
  countLetters = h1.innerHTML.length;
    if (countLetters &amp;lt; maxLineCharacters) {
        h1.innerHTML = input.value;
    } else if (countLetters % maxLineCharacters == 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; countLetters != 0) {
        inputValue = input.value;
        h1.innerHTML += "&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;";
        row = h1.innerHTML;
        input.value = "";
        h1.innerHTML = row + inputValue;
  } else {
        h1.innerHTML = row + input.value;
    }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It may seem long and winding at first look, but I assure you that a line-by-line explanation will quickly make you understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;countLetters = h1.innerHTML.length;&lt;br&gt;
First, we update countLetters variable to be the length of the h1 (where input will be displayed). We can't have a static variable (adding +1 every time user adds a letter) because we will change the length of the text to handle other possible errors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I added all the following code principally for two reasons, first because HTML text inputs have a limit of 100 characters and also because we need to perform some operations when a user writes a determined number of characters, such as adding a line break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (countLetters &amp;lt; maxLineCharacters) {
    h1.innerHTML = input.value;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 78 (you can change this number above) characters will just update o client side, no difficulty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;     } else if (countLetters % maxLineCharacters == 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check if countLetters is a multiple of 78 to be able to add a line break every 78 letters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp; countLetters != 0)&lt;/code&gt; I added this part to prevent the first character from not showing on an even number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;inputValue = input.value;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First we save input value in a variable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;h1.innerHTML += "&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;";&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then we add a line break to the h1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;row = h1.innerHTML;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We save h1 with line break in a variable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;input.value = "";&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We clear input value (so user can type infinitely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;h1.innerHTML = row + inputValue;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And we update another time the h1 will all the variable before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;else { h1.innerHTML = row + input.value; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Last part, when count is greater than 78 and not a multiple of 78 we display previous rows + new values entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple as that, It's not data (rocket) science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I will do another article on that, maybe telling you how to add a complete typewriter effect, how to capitalize all text when user checks a checkbox, or how to add a cursor effect when you write. If you're interested, be sure to smash that like button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helped and thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Check That Email Verification Again - or How I Published My First npm-Package</title>
      <author>Eevis (she/her)</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 09:33:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/eevajonnapanula/check-that-email-verification-again-or-how-i-published-my-first-npm-package-33nl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/eevajonnapanula/check-that-email-verification-again-or-how-i-published-my-first-npm-package-33nl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of getting into the small, irrelevant details when making a demo for a talk.  I had an event coming up where I live coded an app. It uses &lt;a href="https://api.nasa.gov/"&gt;NASA's Asteroids NeoWs -API&lt;/a&gt;, and I needed something to display when the data is loading. I ended up creating a loading spinner, which shows an asteroid moving: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E0J2qm3---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uou37s1keuww3udn81wb.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E0J2qm3---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uou37s1keuww3udn81wb.gif" alt="A drawn asteroid, which moves slowly up and down. Animation of lines after it indicate that it is moving"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I'll share the process of how I created and published the npm-package of the loading indicator. I have only a little experience with SVGs, so this was quite a learning journey both because of the spinner itself and because I've never published an npm-package before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-design-with-figma" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial Design with Figma
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought about creating the loading spinner purely in CSS. I even started it with some divs and CSS-styling but soon realized that I don't have the time to learn all the cool tricks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next idea was to use an SVG. I opened up Figma and started drawing. I had this idea about what I wanted: A reasonably simple asteroid with some lines indicating that it is moving. I spent some time finetuning the initial design, and when it was ready, I exported it as SVG. This is what it looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sfi4pK6b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ggjh83du0smd5z3m5ui0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sfi4pK6b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ggjh83du0smd5z3m5ui0.png" alt="Simple vector asteroid"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exporting the SVG, I imported it into the project. It was time to start coding (if you call CSS and some fiddling with SVGs coding). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-and-animating-the-asteroid" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling and Animating the Asteroid
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When digging deeper into animating SVGs, I found this &lt;a href="https://www.cassie.codes/posts/creating-my-logo-animation/"&gt;amazing tutorial from Cassie Evans&lt;/a&gt;. There are these two properties in SVGs; &lt;code&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stroke-dashoffset.&lt;/code&gt; When learning about those, I realized that I don't need to create dashed lines for the asteroid myself - four straight lines with the properties mentioned above will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to some fiddling with the SVG's code. I am pleased to say that I managed to make the four straight lines instead of the dashed lines you can see from the picture above, and all that with just editing (and deleting) the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With help from Cassie's tutorial, I also managed to create the animations for lines moving at different paces. It was a traditional trial and error case - I investigated different values until the timing and movement were right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also decided that the whole asteroid should move slowly up and down to indicate the movement better. Another thing I'm proud of - I found the right element to use to wrap the contents (&lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;) and gave it a class name to be used for the animations. This might seem small to someone who has more experience with SVGs. However, I am a beginner in the field of SVGs, so this feels like a victory. 🏆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a working loading spinner, and it was time to extract it to a separate npm package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publishing-the-package" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publishing the Package
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For publishing an npm package, I followed &lt;a href="https://api.nasa.gov/"&gt;this tutorial by Ovie Okeh&lt;/a&gt;. It was pretty straightforward to follow, and had there not been this one (self-caused) problem, I would have accomplished my goal in under 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't go through the steps for publishing the npm-package; you can check the tutorial for that, but I will talk a bit about the importance of thoroughly reading an email. I mean, everything was working up until the point where I was supposed to actually publish the package. I started getting this mysterious 403-error for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly spent something like two hours trying to debug this. Finally, I realized I hadn't verified my email, which was the reason for the error. I thought I had clicked the right link, but apparently, I had not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the successful verification, everything worked smoothly. To be honest, I am surprised how easy it was in the end. I was waiting for something like slaying an actual dragon, a gatekeeper for the gates of the npm registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#published" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Published!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I got the package published, and I was happy... Until I realized all the things I could have done better. In the first version, I had given class names to the component, and then they were passed to the correct SVG-elements. I realized that what I was trying to accomplish with that approach was to provide the user with the ability to change the loading spinner's colors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors could actually be given as inline properties to SVG-elements, and thus the spinner would need only the color. This way, the user doesn't have to remember to implement the CSS-class behind the class name. This led to some refactoring, and v2 to be out pretty fast after the initial version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh, I also am learning how to work with npm and keep forgetting things. Once I forgot to run the `build' script before publishing, I wondered why nothing changed. I had to make another patch release to actually update the spinner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the code, here's the repository:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      An asteroid loading spinner React component
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And here's a link to the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/asteroid-loading-spinner"&gt;Asteroid Loading Spinner&lt;/a&gt; npm-package.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up" class="anchor"&gt;

  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been interesting to learn more about npm and also SVGs. And animations. I'm also proud that I actually got something out - I have so many projects that just lie there, and I know I will never finish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you learned something new this year? Please, share if you do! 😊&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to scroll animations with Intersection Observer</title>
      <author>ljc-dev</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 09:14:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ljcdev/introduction-to-scroll-animations-with-intersection-observer-d05</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ljcdev/introduction-to-scroll-animations-with-intersection-observer-d05</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Intersection Observer (IO) detects when an element enters or leaves the viewport (or a parent element). It can be used to easily add animation on scroll without external libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IO is asynchronous and more efficient than scroll listeners 👍.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, if you learn better through videos, I highly suggest this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8EYosX4NOo"&gt;youtube tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by Kewin Powell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a basic example of a fade in animation on scroll using the intersection observer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/embed/XWNXBJg?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example we fade in an image on scroll by adding the class &lt;code&gt;fadeIn&lt;/code&gt;  to it when it enters the viewport. This is the js:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isIntersecting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fadeIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Easy, right? Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-an-intersection-observer" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating an intersection observer
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we create an intersection observer by calling its constructor and passing it a callback function and an optional options object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-options" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The options
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; is an object with 3 properties:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rootMargin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my fade in example, I've returned an empty object &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; so the default options will apply. (Same with not return anything. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;: default &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.  Identifies the Element or Document whose bounds are treated as the bounding box of the viewport for the element which is the observer's target. If the root is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, then the bounds of the actual document viewport are used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;rootMargin&lt;/strong&gt;: default 0px. The values in rootMargin define offsets added to each side of the root's bounding box.  In other words, positive values reduce the root bounding box and negative values increase it. Try scrolling the 3 boxes in this example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/embed/vYyLVdR?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to CSS's margin. For example: "0px 5px 10px 15px" means top: 0px, right: 5px, bottom: 10px and left: 0px.  Accepts px and % only. ⚠ 0 is not an accepted value, use 0px or 0% instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;threshold:&lt;/strong&gt;  default 0. The threshold is a number between 0 and 1.0. 
A value of  0 means as soon as one pixel is visible, the callback will be run.  1.0  means that the threshold isn't considered passed until every pixel is visible. (⚠If you set the threshold to 1 and the element is bigger than the root, the number won't reach 1 because there will be some parts invisible at all time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/embed/bGBEOMa?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-callback" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The callback
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The callback function takes a list of entries and an intersection observer as parameter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Each entry describes an intersection change for one observed&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// target element:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.boundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.intersectionRatio&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.intersectionRect&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.isIntersecting&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.rootBounds&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.target&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//   entry.time&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;observer&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to dynamically add or remove elements to observe. More on it below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus is on the list of &lt;strong&gt;entries&lt;/strong&gt;. There is one ****entry object for each observed element. It's common practice to use a forEach to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each entry has the following helpful properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;entry.isIntersecting&lt;/code&gt; returns a boolean. True means the element is currently intersecting with the root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;entry.target&lt;/code&gt; returns the observed element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used them both in the fadeIn animation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isIntersecting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fadeIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;entry.boundingClientRect&lt;/code&gt; returns the bounds rectangle of the observed element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;entry.intersectionRatio&lt;/code&gt; returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 which indicates how much of the observed element is actually visible within the root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etc. 😁 I've named the most important ones. You can find a list of all the entry properties &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#select-elements-to-be-observed" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Select elements to be observed
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To select an element to observe, we use the &lt;strong&gt;observe()&lt;/strong&gt; method of our Intersection Observer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it! Now &lt;code&gt;myObserver&lt;/code&gt; will detect when &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; enters or leave the viewport and trigger the callback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to observe many elements, you have to add them one by one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or by giving them a common class and iterate with &lt;strong&gt;forEach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imgList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.imgToAnimate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// setting your observer here&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imgList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stop observing, call the &lt;strong&gt;unobserve()&lt;/strong&gt; method on the element:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unobserve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stop observing every element at once call &lt;strong&gt;disconnect()&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;disconnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also use those methods in the callback:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isIntersecting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fadeIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// stop observing this element&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unobserve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thats-it" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  That's it!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you've enjoyed this short intro on Intersection Observer 😃. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside animating on scroll, it can be used to improve render speed and First Contentful Paint by avoiding to run scripts and load images (lazy loading) on parts the user is far from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#beyond-the-basics" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Beyond the basics
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of scroll animations with IO. I'll try to write a blog on each when I find some time 😅.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enter-amp-leave-anim" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enter &amp;amp; Leave Anim
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/embed/mdOVNqr?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scroll-to-top" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scroll To Top
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/embed/abBdxPb?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-current-tab-on-scroll" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update current tab on scroll
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ljc-dev/embed/MWbKdEW?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-more-to-come-" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And more to come 😁!

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triple Equals (&lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;) in Ruby is one of the most powerful features in the entire language, but also one you may not know you're using either. In fact, it's one of the best kept secrets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to learn a bit about those secrets today and explore &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;, how it's defined, what it does, and where it's hiding in your Ruby code today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a rewrite and expansion on an older post of mine from 2017, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/rubyinside/triple-equals-black-magic-d934936a6379"&gt;Triple Equals Black Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and includes updated syntax including Pattern Matching to examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#difficulty" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Difficulty
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundational&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No prerequisite knowledge needed. This post focuses on foundational and fundamental knowledge for Ruby programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#triple-equals" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Triple Equals
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is it? How is it defined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some coming from Javascript might have the notion that &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; is a stricter equality operator than &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, but in Ruby it does something quite different. Defaultly it's an alias for &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, but some classes do something much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes by a few names: Case equality operator, membership operator, triple equals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its function is very much akin to checking to see if the value on the right is a member of whatever is on the left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-its-implemented-in-ruby" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How it's Implemented in Ruby
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by that? Well let's take a look at a few classes real quick to see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt;: Do not use &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; explicitly like this in code, prefer methods with clearer names. We'll see soon when it's acutally used, and often times in an implicit manner rather than explicitly using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ranges" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ranges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range in Ruby has a starting point and an ending point, like &lt;code&gt;1..10&lt;/code&gt; is a range from &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. For it &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; works like &lt;code&gt;include?&lt;/code&gt; which checks if the value on the right happens to be included within the range, or a member of the range:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;include?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ranges are interesting in that they're not limited to numbers. Strings also work, and that makes range inclusion even more interesting:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SUPPORTS_PATTERN_MATCH_VERSIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'2.7.0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'3.0.0'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;SUPPORTS_PATTERN_MATCH_VERSIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'2.7.5'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Granted that example breaks once Ruby goes beyond &lt;code&gt;3.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, but the point is range also recognizes types beyond Integer, and sometimes in interesting ways, but that's the subject for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regular-expressions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regular Expressions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular Expressions are a language for matching against patterns in text, and for &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; it happens to work very much like &lt;code&gt;match?&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/abc/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'abcdef'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/abc/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'abcdef'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; in this case is saying that there's a match, or that our string is a member of the set of matches this Regex refers to. Noticing a pattern?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#classes" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Classes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has classes like &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, and others. Normally you can check to see if something happens to be of a certain type using &lt;code&gt;is_a?&lt;/code&gt;. Not surprisingly &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; works much the same way here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; here is saying that &lt;code&gt;'foo'&lt;/code&gt; is a member of the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class, or it's included in what we'd call Strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this works for about every Ruby core class in the standard library, but as it requires custom implementation there may be some more exotic cases which don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functions-proc-and-lambda" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functions (Proc and Lambda)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a few ways to express anonymous functions, procs and lambdas. There's also block, but we'll focus on those two for the moment. They can be expressed as such:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_proc&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We won't get into differences between all of them in this round, but note that I tend to prefer lambdas in general over procs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use these functions you'd need to use &lt;code&gt;.call&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.()&lt;/code&gt;), which you might not be surprised to find out is &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; as well:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_one_lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This one is a head scratcher. How is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; a member of a function? That doesn't make much sense, it's not really any type of collection or set is it? Well in Mathematics it's called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function"&gt;domain of a function&lt;/a&gt;, or the set of which all valid inputs fall into, so that sounds a lot like membership too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ip-addresses" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IP Addresses
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby also has this lovely feature for all of us Operations and Networking types, &lt;code&gt;IPAddr&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ipaddr'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;IPAddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'10.0.0.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can even express subnets using it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local_network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;IPAddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'192.168.1.0/24'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;local_network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;include?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'192.168.1.1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is your intuition dinging a bit? Because we have another case for &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;local_network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'192.168.1.1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this one we're checking if an IP Address is a member of a given subnet, further rounding out this interesting pattern. Ruby loves patterns, and math and programming in general have a certain affinity for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-case-for-raw-endraw-" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Case for &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is all well and good, but the above warning said not to use &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; explicitly, so why spend all that time describing how it works? Because we're about to see the implicit through &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, every &lt;code&gt;when&lt;/code&gt; branch in a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement compares via &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1990&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1899&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:too_early&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1924&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:gi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1925&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1945&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:silent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1946&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1964&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:baby_boomers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1965&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1979&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:generation_x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1980&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:millenials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2010&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:generation_z&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:generation_alpha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:who_knows&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; :millenials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can even use commas to check against multiple possibilities:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'foobar'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;NilClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:two&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:three&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of potential to check against whether a value is within an expected set, and with functions that gets even more interesting:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;divisible_by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisible_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:fizzbuzz&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisible_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:buzz&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;divisible_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:fizz&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#   1, 2, :fizz, 4, :buzz, :fizz, 7, 8, :fizz, :buzz,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#   11, :fizz, 13, 14, :fizzbuzz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one trick in there called a closure, which is a function which returns another function. That returned function remembers what the value of &lt;code&gt;divisor&lt;/code&gt; was, allowing us to check if somthing is divisible by it. It's a really useful trick from functional programming, and really shows the power of functions in Ruby, especially with things like &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enumerating-all-the-fun-we-can-have" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enumerating All the Fun We Can Have
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumerable&lt;/code&gt; also has a number of methods which take values that respond to &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;. Let's take a look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#predicate-methods" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Predicate Methods
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicate methods (&lt;code&gt;any?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;all?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;none?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;one?&lt;/code&gt;) all play well with &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;any?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-search-is-on" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Search is On
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching methods like &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; (find all that match pattern) and &lt;code&gt;grep_v&lt;/code&gt; (find all that do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; match pattern) also implement a &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; interface:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sx"&gt;%w(The rain in spain falls mainly on the plain)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/the/i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; ["The", "the"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#slice-of-life" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Slice of Life
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also Slice methods that allow us to group elements by a pattern like &lt;code&gt;slice_before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;slice_after&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;slice_before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [[7, 9, 4, 1], [14, 5], [13, 8, 2, 6, 3], [12], [15], [11], [10]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;slice_after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [[7, 9, 4], [1], [14, 5], [13, 8, 2], [6, 3], [12, 15, 11, 10]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pattern-matching" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pattern Matching
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you were excited about &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements let me tell you Pattern Matching is like a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement with a lot of extra fun built in. We won't get into all the nuances of it, but every value is matched against using &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;. It uses &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;when&lt;/code&gt;, which unlocks some additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arraylike" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Array-Like
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports two types of syntaxes, an Array-like match and a Hash-like match. Let's start with Array-like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:close_to_base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:venturing_out&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:pretty_far_out&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:way_out_there&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; :close_to_base&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we want we could even capture those values by name or a few other fun items, but we'll save that for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hashlike" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hash-like
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next is Hash-like, and this is where things get interesting. Let's say we have a JSON API with some data and we got back that data and that data was in a variable called &lt;code&gt;raw_json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raw_json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sh"&gt;
  [{
    "age": 22,
    "eyeColor": "blue",
    "name": { "first": "Trina", "last": "Chang" },
    "friends": ["Browning Marsh", "Keisha Abbott", "Shawn Callahan"]
  }, {
    "age": 32,
    "eyeColor": "brown",
    "name": { "first": "Irma", "last": "Petersen" },
    "friends": ["Koch Ballard", "Chandra Rodriquez", "Carmen Avery"]
  }, {
    "age": 27,
    "eyeColor": "hazel",
    "name": { "first": "Madeleine", "last": "Blake" },
    "friends": ["Tina Massey", "Annette Yates", "Zelma Brennan"]
  }, {
    "age": 20,
    "eyeColor": "green",
    "name": { "first": "Horton", "last": "Haynes" },
    "friends": ["Sophia Oconnor", "Sheila Wilkins", "Mia Molina"]
  }, {
    "age": 12,
    "eyeColor": "brown",
    "name": { "first": "Hull", "last": "Benson" },
    "friends": ["Teresa Mack", "Mcfadden Conley", "Juanita Rollins"]
  }]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'd start by parsing it, but we want to &lt;em&gt;ensure&lt;/em&gt; those keys are &lt;code&gt;Symbols&lt;/code&gt; using this syntax for &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'json'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;json_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raw_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;symbolize_names: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can do something really interesting with Pattern Matching:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;selected_people&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;age: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;eyeColor: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^b/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;first: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^[TI]/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;selected_people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;last: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; ["Trina Chang", "Irma Petersen"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's a lot. What's it doing exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we want to select all people older than &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; with an eye color that starts with the letter &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and a first name that starts with either &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;. How's that for expressive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we're using something called right-hand-assignment (&lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to pull the first and last names out of the person to just return back their names. In Pattern Matching if a key doesn't have a value it gets put into a local variable, hence &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; being accessible in the line right below it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we won't get into all the nuance of Pattern Matching in this post, but you can see how it gets very interesting very quickly. I intend to write a more thorough introduction to Pattern Matching concepts fairly soon, so stay tuned for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was a lot. &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; is hiding everywhere in Ruby, and once you build up an intuition to it you'll notice it pretty frequently. Even better, that intuition means you now know how to create your own &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; if you should find yourself in such a need one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoilers though, it's an operator defined as a method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Example implementation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a lot of interesting facets, and with them a substantial amount of power. This series will continue to cover some of the foundations of Ruby and some of its most useful tools and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then enjoy your newfound knowledge of &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supercharge your morning routine</title>
      <author>Kieran Venison</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 05:50:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kieranmv95/supercharge-your-morning-routine-59kg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kieranmv95/supercharge-your-morning-routine-59kg</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 2 months I have started trying to grow on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kieranmv95" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, created a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX-3WG1vKNVJjGi2mwRziQ" rel="noreferrer"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; account and actively post videos. I started learning serverless framework, changed jobs, worked on my side projects and still have time to do the things I enjoy, but how have I done it? I supercharged my morning routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-not-just-the-morning" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Its not just the morning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's funny how I call this the morning routine when the evening routine plays such a critical part in the making the morning work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can talk about the morning routine we need to talk about the evening routine and more importantly, sleep! I recently watched Matthew Walkers &lt;a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/matthew-walker-teaches-the-science-of-better-sleep" rel="noreferrer"&gt;MasterClass on sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this masterclass he covers the ins and outs of sleep and why it's so important and how to do it right. And I realised, like a lot of people, I had been neglecting my sleep by being very inconsistent. I used to wake for work at 6/6.30 and go to bed anywhere between 10 and 12. Then at weekends I would wake up at 9 and go to bed anywhere between 11 - 1am. A lot of people are the same, they have a schedule through the week then it goes out of the window at weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekend is when people "catch up" on their sleep debt (which actually isn't effective at all). I found that on Sunday evening going to sleep for work on Monday was always my worst nights sleep, I was much more restless than any other night of the week. And it was all to do with my sleep consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fixing-my-sleep" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fixing my sleep
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing sleep consistency. The first step towards powering up my morning routine was fixing my sleep consistency. To do this I now follow a strict evening plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No caffeine after midday - Caffeine has a half life of approximately 8 hours, so if I have a cup of coffee at 4pm its like waking up at midnight to drink half a cup of coffee, When you think of it like this its pretty clear to imagine the impact it has on your sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no screens after 9pm, stop that evil blue light keeping you up. Ideally this could be earlier but this seems to be working for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In bed at 9.30pm and reading until a cutoff of 10, then its sleeping mask on, I find reading naturally helps me wind down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consistency-is-key" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consistency is key
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bit is setting a consistent morning time. So I wake up at 5am every morning, it was very very hard at first. Naturally you may not be a morning person, so don't try and force yourself to do this if its not in your bodies best interest. just set a consistent time that suits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing here is consistency, bed at the same time, wake up at the same time. This means weekends too. I follow the same evening patterns and the same morning patterns as much as I possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-morning-routine" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The morning routine
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the bit that has made me so much more productive and given me time to do a lot more thing. Building your morning routine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up, and just get up. It's hard sometimes and you want to hit snooze or lay just that extra minute.... resist. I leave my clothes by the side of the bed the evening before so I can step out of bed, grab my clothes go to the bathroom and get ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do things to make it easier for yourself, change your heating timing to come on before you wake up so you are not tempted to stay in bed whilst the house warms up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I'm dressed and ready to go I come downstairs have a quick glass of water then get the dog ready and go out for a walk. Before I had the the dog I would just go out for a walk anyway. This is amazing (especially at 5am). Its so quiet, just a nice peaceful walk to wake you up and make sure your active before you start your day, it really clears your mind. Usually this brings me to around 5.30/5.40 when I get back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back home I can spend some time planning out my day, but first I make a nice cup of coffee and a bit of breakfast. To plan my day I use &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;todoist&lt;/a&gt;. And I wrap up my days plan in there. usually its a simple list with categories and subtasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GJ8ndPdN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.kieranvenison.co.uk/static/6695e33ab8779a90694ce3548b3dc0a6/17d12/todoist.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GJ8ndPdN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.kieranvenison.co.uk/static/6695e33ab8779a90694ce3548b3dc0a6/17d12/todoist.png" alt="todoist plan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that's done I will complete any of the tasks I can right away so I can forget about them for the rest of the day, such as taking the bins out and throwing some washing in, or writing  a script for a YouTube video. And then I do the rest through the day when I find the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing with planning things out before the clock has even hit 6am means that I never suffer that late rushed to work feeling where everything is chaos. Every day I sit down at my desk to start working I know what I need to get completed that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may spend the rest of your morning before shooting off to work executing the plan you have made above. I tend to create the plan, do a few tasks off it in the morning and then spend some time learning something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you have had food and drink, had a walk and planned out your day, so by now, your wide awake. Good time to pick up some new skills, I usually spend 30ish minutes on &lt;a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;PluralSight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://frontendmasters.com/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;FrontendMasters&lt;/a&gt; just looking into some new tech. And its proven that if you nail down the consistent sleep stuff we talked about earlier, this stuff will stick in your memory much much better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thats how I supercharged my morning routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to bed at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get some fresh air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a coffee and some breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;execute the plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, in a nutshell, is how I managed to create an active YouTube channel, learn new technologies and work on my side projects whilst changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-you" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What about you?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear what you think of my advice! How do you supercharge your mornings?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I built Realtime in Laravel + VueJS</title>
      <author>David Nguyen</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 05:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hoangit/how-i-built-realtime-in-laravel-vuejs-1hgk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hoangit/how-i-built-realtime-in-laravel-vuejs-1hgk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will introduce the simplest integration of Realtime, after many learning and optimization in the most effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies used in the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/installation"&gt;Backend Laravel 6x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/frontend#writing-vue-components"&gt;Fronent VueJS 2x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lighthouse-php.com"&gt;GraphQL - Lighthouse (A framework for serving GraphQL from Laravel)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pusher.com/channels"&gt;Pusher Channels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will skip the steps to install &lt;strong&gt;Laravel + VueJS&lt;/strong&gt; and to register &lt;strong&gt;Pusher&lt;/strong&gt;, you can learn how to set up at the paths I quoted above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fontend-vuejs" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  #Fontend VueJS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will guide the setup on the fontend VueJS side.&lt;br&gt;
Install the support package from the pusher + laravel echo side provided.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; laravel-echo pusher-js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here I install a package named &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-echo-laravel/"&gt;vue-echo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;vue-echo-laravel &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next add the below configs to the &lt;strong&gt;main.js&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;app.js&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;bootstrap.js&lt;/strong&gt; file (depending on your file).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pusher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pusher-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VueEcho&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;vue-echo-laravel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Enable pusher logging - don't include this in production&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pusher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logToConsole&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;VueEcho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;broadcaster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pusher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;xxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;cluster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ap3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;forceTLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;authEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/broadcasting/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : null // Enabled - If you are using Bearer for authentication&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the content I added to my project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGW_i23f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612587378336/mN4j0_bLz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGW_i23f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612587378336/mN4j0_bLz.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once vue-echo is registered, every vue instance is able to subscribe to channels and listen to events through the this.$echo property on the connection you specified earlier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Listen for the 'NewMessageNotification' event in the 'synchronized' private channel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;NewMessageNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the content I added to my project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rL_HmoXV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612587299888/xxvYQla9_.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rL_HmoXV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612587299888/xxvYQla9_.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend-laravel" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  #Backend Laravel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terminal&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer require pusher/pusher-php-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;config/app.php&lt;/strong&gt; you need to unhide or add this line&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Providers\BroadcastServiceProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jQquQ0OI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612587794102/VsG3kVLjr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jQquQ0OI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612587794102/VsG3kVLjr.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you will need to change your broadcast driver to pusher in your &lt;strong&gt;.env&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ini"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;PUSHER_APP_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;xxxxxxxx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;PUSHER_APP_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;xxxxxxxxxx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;PUSHER_APP_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;xxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;xxxxxx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="py"&gt;BROADCAST_DRIVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;pusher&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;CACHE_DRIVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;QUEUE_CONNECTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;sync&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;SESSION_DRIVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;SESSION_LIFETIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-event-from-backend" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  #Create Event - From Backend
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/events"&gt;Document Events - Laravel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/events"&gt;Document  Pusher Channels Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will quickly create an Events named &lt;code&gt;NewMessageNotification&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;app\Events&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r0A7iWJC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588328179/TqTLB9mkT.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r0A7iWJC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588328179/TqTLB9mkT.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Broadcasting\PresenceChannel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Broadcasting\PrivateChannel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcastNow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NewMessageNotification&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShouldBroadcastNow&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Dispatchable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;InteractsWithSockets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SerializesModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Create a new event instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Get the channels the event should broadcast on.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel|array
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;broadcastOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;PrivateChannel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'synchronized'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Register channels at &lt;code&gt;routes/channels.php&lt;/code&gt; with&lt;code&gt;return Auth::check();&lt;/code&gt; . I force the &lt;strong&gt;Client-side&lt;/strong&gt; to log in to listen to the event.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Broadcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'synchronized'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3kV_on_D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588622699/AnXUa1Hoh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3kV_on_D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588622699/AnXUa1Hoh.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the dashboard in Pusher, if successful connection will be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTwStLP9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588795065/-hQheAw-j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTwStLP9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588795065/-hQheAw-j.png" alt="image (1).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use the Debug console function in Pusher to do the event quick send.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fleIqfJX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588827452/ctO8mpZcd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fleIqfJX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612588827452/ctO8mpZcd.png" alt="image (2).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can also use the Laravel Backend to post events, I will guide you in the following post, or &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/events#dispatching-events"&gt;refer here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the result&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7TtcTFZ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612589093926/nBzvBVr0s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7TtcTFZ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612589093926/nBzvBVr0s.png" alt="image (3).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any questions, please comment below. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
