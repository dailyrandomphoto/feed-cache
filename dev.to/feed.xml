      <title>Women Empowerment, Mentorship &amp; Growth</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/nerdingitout/women-empowerment-mentorship-growth-1jh0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Women empowerment has always been something that I’m passionate about. Being surrounded by a community that helped me grow to become the reliable and strong developer I am today is something that I am truly grateful for and I wish the same for every woman out there! To find the support system to help her grow and become someone extraordinary and remarkable in what she does.&lt;br&gt;
In the light of International Women’s Day, I decided to highlight some of the key factors in empowering women (and everyone) everywhere from my own perspective and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mentorship" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mentorship
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A8xH3wou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zfr6gi5wsqqbdltouwwg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A8xH3wou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zfr6gi5wsqqbdltouwwg.jpg" alt="bonneval-sebastien-lG-6_ox_UXE-unsplash"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important parts of my life is getting my first mentor when I was a sophomore, it helped shape the path I took in my career afterward and I’m really grateful for my first mentorship experience and for our conversations on leadership and how to improve my social skills. It really opened my eyes to focus on my goals in life and how to achieve them.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, I did not only focus on my technical skills but I also worked on my soft skills, so I took speech classes to boost my confidence and writing classes to improve my communication skills in addition to participating in extracurricular activities. All of these, and more, helped me shape who I am as a person today. After all, leadership and soft skills are essential in a developer’s career, and as a woman, they helped me pave the path of my career journey.&lt;br&gt;
So I would like to highlight the importance of mentorship, whether you were a student, newly grad, or a professional, mentorship is essential to your career! Grow your connections, find the right mentor for you, and get started with your mentorship journey! You will be surprised with how much you can gain through mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tackling-imposter-syndrome" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tackling Imposter Syndrome
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imposter Syndrome has always been a challenge that both women and men deal with. Feeling like a fraud and dealing with those negative thoughts on a daily basis while doing any task can be really challenging. Imposter syndrome will always be an issue that we will deal with as it’s something that’s coming from within and we have to fight these doubts! And that’s why it is important to spread awareness of Imposter Syndrome and always remind ourselves that “I’m strong, I’m enough”.&lt;br&gt;
Imposter syndrome can be born from several factors related to personality traits like anxiety or perfectionism or could be related to behavioral courses affected by the surrounding environment.&lt;br&gt;
There are several ways you could tackle imposter syndrome, and I’m not an expert, but there were some practices that helped me stand strong against it, like talking to a mentor or someone I know about it, organizing my thoughts, and reminding myself that I’m doing fine and that no one’s perfect, having a reasonable list of tasks to achieve on daily/weekly basis, and finally taking a moment to reflect on myself, my achievements and giving myself pep talks so often to encourage myself.&lt;br&gt;
Now.. take a moment to reflect on your own achievements and how far you have gone from a personal or professional point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#growth" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Growth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have mentioned imposter syndrome, it is essential to bring up growth. Each person grows at their own pace and this year I learned how to grow.. patiently. Patience is essential to growth and it is okay if we take our time growing. One time I was listening to an episode of the TED Radio Hour podcast titled “It Takes Time” and I loved it! and I have been thinking of it almost every day! It reminded me that some things do not need to be rushed to reach their full potential.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8cHvKIH0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6i484cisu3z6d0jgnw6z.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8cHvKIH0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6i484cisu3z6d0jgnw6z.jpg" alt="hello-i-m-nik-AsRAyHIkOHk-unsplashff"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
One of my favorite parts was when they talked about sloths! (my favorite animal) and it changed my perspective a whole lot! We always perceived sloths as lazy, but in fact, they are not.. They are just taking their time doing things their own way and I think that’s amazing!&lt;br&gt;
Sloths might be slow, but they are built differently (in fact, they are strong), which allows them to stay hanging on trees the entire day or pull heavy items (an adult sloth can be 3x stronger than a human).&lt;br&gt;
Sloths are built differently, so we cannot really say that they are slow because they don’t meet our usual pace (or expectations) as humans. I could write many facts about sloths but then it would be a long list of facts. So I hope that my thoughts on growth gave you a new perspective on the topic (and sloths).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3YzvGwvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/we3a6ifbe6zxzse573la.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3YzvGwvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/we3a6ifbe6zxzse573la.jpg" alt="william-phipps-l4QSO66AwmE-unsplash (1)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Essentially, community, mentorship, and allyship are all part of growing as a person. And so I would like to encourage you to take on the opportunity to be part of a community whether as a mentee or a mentor.&lt;br&gt;
Allow yourself to challenge and be challenged, but always remember to pace yourself and grow patiently. And with that being said, I would like to give some room for the question “How can I grow? How will I grow patiently”&lt;br&gt;
Happy International Women’s Day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4 Steps to Debug Any Problem</title>
      <author>Michael Chrupcala</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 17:55:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mikechrupcala/4-steps-to-debug-any-problem-3565</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mikechrupcala/4-steps-to-debug-any-problem-3565</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your leg started to cramp ten minutes ago, but you barely noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chatter from a distant TV is nothing but background noise...white noise, a gentle reminder of the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your only focus is the sound from the strokes of your keyboard…click click click…a rapid-fire staccato of instructions to your machine...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create Object&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;em&gt;insert method&lt;/em&gt;…then suddenly, the moment of truth when you test the lines you’ve just added……Success! Great, now you just have to add that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; last function…broken! What!! Which line???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing code isn't easy, no matter how much experience you have with it.&lt;/strong&gt; When you get something wrong, some errors are more helpful than others at pointing you toward the mistake. Usually it just takes one obvious re-write to get your program back up-and-running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what happens when you’re stuck?&lt;/strong&gt; Completely at a loss, and staring at 200+lines of computer-speak that seemed very familiar to you just a second ago, and very &lt;em&gt;unfamiliar&lt;/em&gt; in an instant. How do you work your way out of the problem? &lt;strong&gt;Try these steps to debug your code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-0-check-for-grammarspelling-mistakes" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 0: Check for Grammar/Spelling Mistakes
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious? Sure, but I’ve noticed that 98% of my mistakes come from a misplaced comma or a misspelled “this”. Code is a fickle, unforgiving tool, and one extra letter or missing syntax can confuse your compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Pictured below: me, for 2 hours, trying to find the extra “.” in my code)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/guSDEekNFb23C/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/guSDEekNFb23C/giphy.gif" alt="A very confused man looking franticly around"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, most IDE’s will come with features to help you catch errors faster. Personally I love all of the following features: &lt;strong&gt;auto-complete&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;error detection&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;color-coding&lt;/strong&gt;. That last one’s my favorite because it means I can skim through a bunch of orange text strings and notice that little red stinker with the missing quotation mark. But if that didn’t work, ask yourself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-what-do-you-know" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: What do you know?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can feel really frustrating when your confidence is dashed by a bright red ‘ERROR’ across the screen. But you knew enough to get yourself here, and that means you probably know enough to get yourself out! So first, you should pick apart the error message and take a mental note of what’s familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Syntax error&lt;/strong&gt;…I’ve seen this before, and the last time it was just a typo.”&lt;br&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;Null value&lt;/strong&gt;….well I know that means that some value is either undefined or it doesn’t exist. Oh, and I also know that the value is probably considered ‘false’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can try is, if you added more than a few lines of code, then you can isolate them and read slowly line-by-line. Explain to yourself what &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the lines should be doing, or read every word and remind yourself of the definitions. Maybe you forgot the “OR” operator, or you wrote &lt;strong&gt;splice()&lt;/strong&gt; when you needed &lt;strong&gt;slice()&lt;/strong&gt;. Which leads me to the next step…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-what-are-you-missing" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: What are you missing?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it could be really helpful to make a list of what you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EpcLl2zo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4fvjkh4tvtbhueyhcmkp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EpcLl2zo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4fvjkh4tvtbhueyhcmkp.jpg" alt="Notebook on a wooden desk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have an idea of which line of code is the problem? If not, check the error message again to &lt;strong&gt;isolate&lt;/strong&gt; the problem. Is there a new word in the error message that you haven’t seen before? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you practicing a new concept, one that’s complicated and might be interacting with your code in a way that you wouldn’t expect? Maybe the asynchronous function you're calling has timing problem that you've never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case then you might need to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-research-the-unfamiliar" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Research the unfamiliar.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, hands-down, my favorite part of coding. Every day you might face a new challenge, and every day that challenge can be an opportunity for growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of resources available online for computer programming is staggering. From articles that break down highly-specific edge cases, all the way up to complete Ivy League courses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to feel discouraged when you run into a new term/concept. Programming languages are massive, and this can happen every day! Instead, try seeing it as an invitation to go down the research rabbit hole. You never know which doors your curiosity could open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For beginners, &lt;strong&gt;reading the documentation is a secret weapon.&lt;/strong&gt; Every popular framework &amp;amp; library will have its own website that's dedicated to explaining its features and to show you examples. You should use a library's docs as your starting place for research, so that you can build a mental model of how a feature &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; work, which will give you a better idea of how you're trying to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-find-somebody-who-shares-your-problem" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Find somebody who shares your problem.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare, and especially rare at the beginning of your career, for you to have a problem that nobody’s ever grappled with. There are more than seven billion people on this planet- that’s a lot of engineers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage I like to get creative with my Google searches. Say I’m writing in JavaScript and I’m uncomfortable with ‘closure’ (and no, we're not asking my ex-girlfriend). Searching for the phrase “Javascript closure” is a good start, but “stackoverflow closure” will give me pages full of community-answered code examples, “r/javascript closure” will include 10+ posts on a wildly popular Reddit community, and that’s not even the tip of the iceberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first few walkthroughs that you find are dry or poorly explained, then there’s no limit to the amount of information you’ll find online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you’re at with your professional development, and no matter what you’re working on, the best thing you can do is keep going. Even if you went through all these steps and you’re still stuck, taking a 5-minute walk outside can usually break down that nasty roadblock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikechrupcala"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more programming tips, and DM me if you have any questions or if you’d like some advice. I hope this helped, and thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angular CDK - Platform Module</title>
      <author>Maina Wycliffe</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 16:46:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/this-is-angular/angular-cdk-platform-module-2pac</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-angular/angular-cdk-platform-module-2pac</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to take a look at the Platform Module from Angular CDK. The platform module provides you with information about the current platform where your web app is running on, such as OS, Browser, Rendering Engine, etc. It also gives you information on the features the platform supports such as scroll behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables you to identify the platform where your app is running on and modify the behavior of your Angular app appropriately. The CDK Platform Module makes the following information available to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Android - Whether the OS is Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is iOS - Whether the OS is iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Firefox - Whether the browser is Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Edge - Whether the browser is Edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Safari - Whether the browser is Safari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Blink - Whether the rendering engine is Blink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Webkit - Whether the rendering engine is WebKit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Trident - Whether the rendering engine is &lt;a href="https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Trident_(software)"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported Input Types - A list of input form field types supported by the browser i.e. number, password, radio, range, reset, search, submit, tel, text, time, url, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the browsers supports &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior"&gt;Scroll Behavior&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Whether the browser supports &lt;a href="https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/"&gt;passive event listeners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using yarn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn add @angular/cdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install @angular/cdk using yarn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using NPM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @angular/cdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install @angular/cdk using npm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will need to import the &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/code&gt; inside our app module, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// other imports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... components&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other modules&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using feature or shared modules, you will need to import &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; inside the module where the component using it is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we are going to inject the &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; service into the component where we want to use the platform information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other imports&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... component metadata&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can determine the browser platform information as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ANDROID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if OS is android&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FIREFOX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if Browser is Firefox&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BLINK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if render engine is Blink&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isBrowser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if the app is being rendered on the browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to implement a share functionality for our web app, where on mobile devices i.e. iOS and Android, we will use native share while on Desktop, we will use share buttons for each Social Media Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; to determine if the user is on &lt;code&gt;iOS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Android&lt;/code&gt;, and then we will use the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/web-share/"&gt;WebShare API&lt;/a&gt;. For other devices i.e. Desktop, we will just show a simple twitter share button instead. Here is what our component looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app-social-share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./social-share.component.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./social-share.component.scss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SocialShareComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hashtags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;tweetShareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// show native share if on Android and IOS and if it is supported&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ANDROID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweetShareUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;via=mwycliffe_dev&amp;amp;text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;hashtags=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hashtags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nativeShare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;substr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our share component above, has a property named &lt;code&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/code&gt; - which is a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;. We are checking whether the current browser supports native share, and the platform is iOS or Android before setting that property to true. And then we can use this property to show the correct UI, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;*ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"isNativeShareSupported; else showSocialShareButton"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;(click)=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nativeShare()"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space-x-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Share this article&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ng-container&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;#showSocialShareButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Share on this article: &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"_blank"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[href]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tweetShareUrl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Twitter&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ng-template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have learned how to use CDK &lt;code&gt;Platform Module&lt;/code&gt; to check the platform details in which our app is running on. This is a simple and quite useful way of modifying the behavior of your Angular app based on the platform being used. This can lead to an improved UX as you can enable enhanced features to users with access to them while providing a decent fallback to users without access to the enhanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow! Today is International Women's Day. I am glad that this day officially exist to give value and honor to all the women in the world who are making great difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like count myself in for making a difference and also to my mother who is not with me in this world today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-me-" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About Me :)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name &lt;a href="https://jonahandersson.tech/"&gt;Jonah Andersson&lt;/a&gt; is a Filipina-Swedish Software Developer at Forefront Consulting, Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied Computer Science, Agile System Development i C# .NET, and Programming in Java. I had a childhood dream of being an architect or civil engineer but due to life circumstances, I  ended up studying about the science of computers and programming and she didn’t regret that! In fact, I enjoys being a programmer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoys solving challenging complex problems, coding back-end and has great interest in developing applications full-stack in C# .NET using new technologies such as Microsoft Azure. From time to time, I shares my technical knowledge at some virtual conferences and user groups on my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to teach programming to kids in schools and saw the gender inequality problem there. I volunteer to mentor and to help make a difference by inspiring tech to young women. I like to connect with other developers, share my technical skills with others, and personally helping out with gender diversity and inclusion in my workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Q5cfBMB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r5arigvq7xg7qeb5f9o.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Q5cfBMB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r5arigvq7xg7qeb5f9o.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-inspiring-story-to-tech-and-software-engineering" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Inspiring Story To Tech and Software Engineering
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey to starting a career to the tech industry is a long, challenging and inspiring story. It all started in the Philippines where I grew up. When I was a young girl, I got to watch a story about the amazon women, back then when I was a kid, they were used to be known to be fierce female warriors. Different, strong and brave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I wanted to be different and strong like the amazon women I’ve been on TV. However, I was not as brave when I was a young girl. I was shy and was scared to be in the crowd. My mother used to encourage me to face that fear. My choice of dream job and education were influenced by my dreams and what I wanted myself to be - to be different, brave, and strong. That somehow influenced me. I had a dream to become a civil engineer, which was back then known to be a men-dominated job wherever you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dream job didn’t happen because of life circumstances and economic reasons. In the Philippines, getting a good degree in a good college or a university is not free. We don’t have that privilege of free university education. However, we have scholarship programs supported by private organizations or the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my parents could not afford to send me to college and take the civil engineering degree that I dreamed of, I took the initiative of taking a government scholarship that was offered in my high school back then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to go to the university and chase my dreams. So, when I was finishing high school, I took a scholarship exam offered. I took the scholarship exam, I passed it and I did it. I got the scholarship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not not have the option to study civil engineering in my scholarship program, but I was really glad. I had the opportunity to study Computer Science at a private college Asian College of Science and Technology in the Philippines. I studied a degree in Computer Science as a scholar and graduated in 2004. It was also the toughest year in my life when my mother (also my best-friend mom) died of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just turned 18 years old then. When my mother died, as the eldest child in the family, I was forced to take the responsibility of being the breadwinner of the family. Instead of finding a job within the programming field, I took the first job as technical support that I could have back then to earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved from the Philippines to Sweden 9 years ago, I decided to pursue my passion and dream to work with software engineering. I studied more about software development in programming languages C# and Java for another 3 years until I got my first job as a full stack software developer in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

  Volunteering - Mentorship and Being A Role-Model To Fix Gender Diversity Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December 2020, I was invited to speaking at Virtual Azure Community Day. One of the topics I proposed talking was about Gender Inequality Problem in Tech. In that talk, I presented to the public the list of reasons, what I think we should do and what I am doing myself to fix it. You can watch my talk about it on &lt;a href="https://azureday.community/english-december-2020/gender-equality-in-tech-why-is-it-a-problem-and-how-can-we-fix-it/"&gt;Gender Inequality in Tech - Why Is it a problem and How can we fix it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  The things I've learned working as a woman in tech and working in software engineering field
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am a programmer who is expected to think logically, I am also a deep thinker and a reflective person. I have learned a lot in life and through the years so far working as a woman in tech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned to keep learning from whatever challenges I face. To think outside the box. To learn how to see things in a bigger perspective yet understand what small details. To never take things personally if there are people who drag me down and belittles me. To be myself, be unique and to never pretend to be a better person you are not - just to prove myself to others expectations. To be open and true to yourself and work to your goals - not for others, but for the best self. &lt;/p&gt;

  My Advice to all women and anyone who belongs to underrepresented groups who want to work in Tech Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow your heart, your dreams, dare speak up and never give up! To find a good mentor and good role models. Follow the desires of your heart and what you want to achieve. To never give when everything seems hopeless. Value your good contacts and network with people in tech. Dare speak up your thoughts even if you feel uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another 8th of March, yet we are not still there!
</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where are we about equality in tech in 2021? Aren't we still there yet? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long does it take to get there to have true equality in the tech industry? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time of the pandemic and working from home shouldn't absorb people's voices and give companies to be a ghost if there are employees who belong to minority groups in tech who haven't have sufficient resources to be productive at home and can't raise their voices enough. It is the responsibility of the organization which needs to push and makes sure to have people's voices heard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still seeing posts in 2021 telling us that if you want more women in tech then start training them. I believe to the opposite that it's not the problem we don't have enough women educated in tech, but the problem should be somewhere else if you don't see enough in your organization. I believe unconscious bias is something serious as much as conscious bias and people should have trained regularly since unconscious bias could be a very sneaky disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about the math of the problem to get the equality equation right, you need to put absent positive values to fill the gap from the past that we had collected enough negative ones. The inevitable result is that the equation will never be achieved if only women who are the one embracing the equality approach in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To seeing enormous companies which we had seen diversity term in action when they were a start-up are taking the backward side of the road is just frustrating. Carrying the diversity in a company shouldn't be reminding employees that they are not male in tech, diversity should be about different voices we have that would contribute our products from different angles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reports by TrustRadius[1], women are more likely to be laid off and have more pressure in terms of productivity than men in the tech industry which is still having issues about under-represented women. In addition to the burden taken by women for child care is 20% higher than men and the pandemic increases family responsible by 60%, we should be aware of the pandemic, and working from home opens the gap in terms of equality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel very lucky to see people in my organization embracing the same approach. I have started my tech journey when I was in high school and started to deny the fact that it is a male-dominated environment. Now I'm finally feeling that I can raise my voice in my organization freely and my voice has no different than majority groups, however, not every woman or minority in tech has the same environment and that shows that we are not even close to accomplishing equality in 2021. If we are concerned about newly graduated women will eventually face an unconscious bias somewhere in their path until finding the right environment, this means we have a lot to do. If you have never seen any injustice towards women in tech, raise your voice for others, but if you do, you should have been already raised your voice by now with no excuse. Look at the glass ceiling and break it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now if this is not the right time to face your work environment and make it better for being equal in terms of diversity, then when is? I believe this is time to ask if we are where we want to be in terms of equality in the tech industry since every effort counts. Women do not need anything but equality on the 8th of march and every other day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time for the tech industry to walk away from toxic masculinity and lead by example to the world. "The world is waking up, and change is coming whether you like or not."&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Importance of Self-Advocacy for Career Advancement</title>
      <author>Nahrin Jalal</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 15:15:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-importance-of-self-advocacy-for-career-advancement-2nh6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-importance-of-self-advocacy-for-career-advancement-2nh6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year marks five years (!) since I &lt;a href="https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-one-where-i-share-my-journey-to-tech-anj"&gt;started my career in the tech industry&lt;/a&gt;. To commemorate the milestone, I want to share a practice that has played a monumental role in my career advancement over this time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent self-advocacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often tell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NahrinJalal/status/1050078722605416450"&gt;my students&lt;/a&gt; how imperative it is to share their accomplishments and elevate their visibility regularly. A lot goes into this, such as weekly accomplishment tracking, connecting your achievements to compensation, scheduling weekly meetings with your manager, collecting testimonials, and more. However, the most repeated blocker I hear is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don't know how to tell their story effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories have three parts: a problem, a solution, and a result. If you accomplished something at work recently, you likely had to go through all three of those phases to that point. So now it's time to think about yourself as the protagonist of this story and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crafting-your-story" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Crafting Your Story
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, reflect on a professional accomplishment that you're proud of—ideally one that took place recently. Then, answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenge did you overcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you break into a new industry or find success with a difficult client? What is the headline of your story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight your contribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly share how &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; solution addressed the issue. How were your strengths and passions essential?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the business impact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you make money or save money for the company? Did you contribute to innovation, revenue, growth, or culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to keep your story short! Your final result should be about 3-4 sentences (or bullet points) long. Your manager doesn't have time to read an essay, but she will appreciate and remember your impact if she can quickly understand how you solved a problem for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, bear in mind that not every key accomplishment may fit into this storytelling structure. Please still share those other accomplishments with your manager—ensuring that you're still effectively highlighting how you impacted the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it all boils down to how you made a difference. Be proud of what you have achieved and share your accomplishments widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#seek-support-when-you-need-it" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Seek Support When You Need It
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-advocacy is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling, remember that you are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the only one feeling this way, and it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; get easier with practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, never think you need to go it alone. Reach out to a mentor. Vent to a trusted friend. Let this incredible community support you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Most Recent Achievement Was...</title>
      <author>Debra-Kaye Elliott</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 14:55:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/my-most-recent-achievement-was-1al2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/my-most-recent-achievement-was-1al2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a year of lows, highs and more lows. To say challenging would be putting it mildly. The struggles continue. Nevertheless, I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of the lows, the highs I achieved were both unexpected and amazing 💙:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My first tech blog post &lt;a href="https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/navigating-the-world-of-web-development-4eao"&gt;Navigating the World of Web Development&lt;/a&gt; relating to so many others in the dev community on this journey &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the Virtual Coffee community that's so supportive of where I am and encourage me to never give up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being featured by CodeNewbie for the &lt;a href="https://community.codenewbie.org/codenewbie/debra-kaye-elliott-the-go-getter-43mh"&gt;February 2021 Community Member Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, my biggest achievement ever! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey is not one to be navigated alone. It has been challenging. It has been demotivating, more times than I care to admit. It has made me feel like I'm not progressing. This is why participating in the right communities is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; important. The right people will meet you where you are and not judge you, will help you through your struggles, help you learn, encourage you to keep going and celebrate your wins with you. The saying goes "Surround yourself with positive and uplifting people," and those are the only types of people I want in my circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest goal is to be the best developer I can be, and work with great people in a supportive environment. A developer will do great work and grow in an environment where they're supported, their voice is heard, their team listens, they feel valued and are celebrated. That's where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been more than a challenging journey. Nevertheless, I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Resources to Get Started with AWS CloudFormation</title>
      <author>Jenna Pederson</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 14:25:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws/five-resources-to-get-started-with-aws-cloudformation-1f3p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws/five-resources-to-get-started-with-aws-cloudformation-1f3p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What if instead of manually configuring your infrastructure resources, one by one, in a web browser or at the command line, you could manage it all in code? What if you could manage whole environments across the globe, at scale? You can, with Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Here, we'll cover Iac, AWS CloudFormation, and five resources to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as Code is the management of infrastructure resources and their dependencies with code. It allows you to manage and provision whole environments reliably and at scale, automatically. Historically infrastructure was managed manually, with scripts, or run books, and became out of date quickly if changes were made directly to those resources. When you treat your infrastructure as code, just as you would your application code, you get the same benefits: you can provision the same environment multiple times, it can be version controlled, it's less brittle, it can be reused, and it can be tested. And just like your application code, you edit the source code to make changes to your infrastructure. Infrastructure as code also lets you take advantage of the cloud's pay-as-you-go pricing, provisioning and de-provisioning resources as needed, scaling up or down as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS CloudFormation is one such tool that allows you to manage and provision AWS infrastructure predictably and repeatedly with code. With a CloudFormation template, you can define a set of AWS resources and manage that collection of resources together as one stack. By treating your infrastructure as code, you can manage the CloudFormation template in version control, just like you do your application code. With CloudFormation, you can automate your best practices, scale your infrastructure across the globe, and integrate with other AWS services to control access, improve automation, testing, and controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloudformation-resources" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CloudFormation Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to start managing your AWS infrastructure resources in code, CloudFormation is a good place to start. Here are five resources that I found helpful as I was getting started with CloudFormation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-aws-cloudformation-workshop" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The AWS CloudFormation workshop
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpscfn101workshopaws" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔗 &lt;a href="https://cfn101.workshop.aws/"&gt;https://cfn101.workshop.aws/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a self-guided workshop that walks you through the foundational features and concepts of using CloudFormation to provision an Amazon EC2 instance and related services and configuration. It introduces Nested Stacks and Layered Stacks for reusing templates and stacks and also covers the basics of packaging and deployment as your stacks become more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-handson-cloudformation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More hands-on CloudFormation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpsdevtotiamatthandsonawscloudformationpart1itallstartshere5153" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔗 &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tiamatt/hands-on-aws-cloudformation-part-1-it-all-starts-here-5153"&gt;https://dev.to/tiamatt/hands-on-aws-cloudformation-part-1-it-all-starts-here-5153&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A five-part series by Samira Yusifova, covering the foundational concepts of CloudFormation. She even explains what the dependent resources are and why you'll need them, including CIDR blocks, Internet Gateways, public and private subnets, and VPCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#organizing-your-templates" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Organizing your templates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpsdevtoawsbuildershowtoorganizecloudformationstackstominimizeblastradius1lee" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔗 &lt;a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-to-organize-cloudformation-stacks-to-minimize-blast-radius-1lee"&gt;https://dev.to/aws-builders/how-to-organize-cloudformation-stacks-to-minimize-blast-radius-1lee&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gert Leenders explains ways to organize your stacks to reflect the volatility of your resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sample-aws-cloudformation-templates" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sample AWS CloudFormation templates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpsgithubcomawslabsawscloudformationtemplates" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔗 &lt;a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates"&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sample templates can help you learn how to solve a specific problem and serve as a good starting point for your templates. Both the AWS team and community contribute and maintain these samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-official-aws-documentation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The official AWS documentation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpsdocsawsamazoncomcloudformation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔗 &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"&gt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official documentation that goes into more detail, like how to use &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/index.html"&gt;CloudFormation at the command line&lt;/a&gt; and how to &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html"&gt;configure each and every resource type&lt;/a&gt; supported in your template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-aws-cdk" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is AWS CDK?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in managing your infrastructure with TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#/.Net? Check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html"&gt;AWS CDK&lt;/a&gt;. The AWS CDK lets you define your cloud infrastructure in familiar programming languages (as opposed to JSON and YAML with CloudFormation) and provisions your cloud resources through CloudFormation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, these resources have been helpful to you. Feel free to share your own suggestions in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Refactoring type annotations to PHP 7.4 type declarations with Rector</title>
      <author>Robert Radošić</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 14:11:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bornfightcompany/refactoring-type-annotations-to-php-7-4-type-declarations-with-rector-50a4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bornfightcompany/refactoring-type-annotations-to-php-7-4-type-declarations-with-rector-50a4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have an older PHP project that uses type hinting via annotations and you would like to move away from those ugly annotations to nice inline type declarations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strict_types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
    * @var string
    */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$someProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strict_types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$someProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sure, you could do it manually but depending on the size of the project this could take anywhere from a day to a couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, worry not, this is where &lt;a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector"&gt;Rector&lt;/a&gt; comes in. Rector is a "tool for automated refactoring" that will make changes in your code based on pre-defined rules. One of those &lt;a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/master/docs/rector_rules_overview.md"&gt;many rules&lt;/a&gt; will help us to automatically move type declarations from annotations to inline declarations and that rule is called TypedPropertyRector. So now that we know what Rector is and what rule to use, how do we use it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all install Rector using composer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;composer require rector/rector --dev&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Next, use the init command to create the rector.php config file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;vendor/bin/rector init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to modify the config file to suit our use case&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//rector.php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strict_types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Rector\Php74\Rector\Property\TypedPropertyRector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;ContainerConfigurator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$containerConfigurator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$services&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$containerConfigurator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TypedPropertyRector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can either run Rector to process your files in the src directory&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;vendor/bin/rector process src&lt;/code&gt; or do a dry run to catch any errors that might pop up beforehand &lt;code&gt;vendor/bin/rector process src --dry-run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rector is an amazing tool that will let you do all sorts of improvements on your code and automate a lot of work when migrating to other PHP versions. It's also not a bad idea to consider using it as a part of your CI pipeline for automated code refactoring or even automated code review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing with discomfort. Change.</title>
      <author>Holger Blank</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely, if ever, talk or write about my personal journey in public. Mainly because I feel uncomfortable while doing so. Time to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time as a co-organizer of tech-community events  like &lt;a href="https://jsconf.eu"&gt;JSConf EU&lt;/a&gt; and others for the last 10+ years I had the opportunity to listen and learn a lot. But as I figured out really soon, I also had the need to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn't been that one single event that helped me to see the undeniable structural facts of our unequal society and workplaces around me. I learned, slowly, over years. I was able to see things clearer over time. Most of the time I felt uncomfortable with a lot of things I've seen and learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my personal journey, as a highly privileged white-male, I was lucky to have a group of people around me that helped me to reflect the situation, making me feel uncomfortable, developing my views including also co-creating small things that hopefully made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'm glad that the team I'm working with most of the time, is not only incredibly open for change but also drives a lot of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raffaele (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixari"&gt;@pixari&lt;/a&gt;) from our Munich based team wrote an incredible article about his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest spending 11 minutes reading that one (not only) to every of my male colleagues. I also propose to spend many more minutes following all the links he has collected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/pixari" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4QxQMCLJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gml6DBXc--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/116548/9268c77e-fe45-41a1-8363-ef7a93c7ca4e.jpg" alt="pixari image"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/s2engineers/step-up-listen-up-shut-up-50ca" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Step up. Listen up. Shut up.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Raffaele Pizzari ・ Mar  3 ・ 11 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#shecodedally&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#genderequality&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#womensrights&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#choosetochallenge&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The next post I recommend reading is from Feli (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kotzendekrabbe"&gt;@kotzendekrabbe&lt;/a&gt;). Feli and me first met at JSConf EU 2015, since 2016 we're working together. Since then, Feli made me feel uncomfortable more than once. I'm thankful for every single time!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/kotzendekrabbe" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FGAezosk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--089_GL-f--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/142652/455ddc9a-86ea-4236-8eb1-d73093daea6d.jpg" alt="kotzendekrabbe image"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/s2engineers/nevertheless-feli-coded-choosetochallenge-yourself-4enn" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Nevertheless, Feli Coded - ChooseToChallenge Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Feli (she/her) ・ Mar  4 ・ 3 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#shecoded&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#womenintech&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#choosetochallenge&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#career&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming uncomfortable is always my starting point for change. And it could become yours too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest not only to allow others to make you feel uncomfortable, but creating a culture where everybody is aware of their unearned privileges and is fostering a culture where being confronted is valued as a joint and common starting point of change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Use Styled-Components In React</title>
      <author>Paul Mercieca</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:40:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/paulmercieca/how-to-use-styled-components-in-react-54o5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/paulmercieca/how-to-use-styled-components-in-react-54o5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Styled components are a CSS-in-JS tool that bridges the gap between components and styling, offering numerous features to get you up and running in styling components in a functional and reusable way. In this article, you’ll learn the basics of styled components and how to properly apply them to your React applications. You should have worked on React previously before going through this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of CSS is the capability to target any HTML element — globally — no matter its position in the DOM tree. This can be a hindrance when used with components, because components demand, to a reasonable extent, colocation (i.e. keeping assets such as states and styling) closer to where they’re used (known as localisation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In React’s own words, styled components are “visual primitives for components”, and their goal is to give us a flexible way to style components. The result is a tight coupling between components and their styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-styled-components" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Styled Components?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping you to scope styles, styled components include the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Automatic vendor prefixing:&lt;/strong&gt; You can use standard CSS properties, and styled components will add vendor prefixes should they be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unique class names:&lt;/strong&gt; Styled components are independent of each other, and you do not have to worry about their names because the library handles that for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Elimination of dead styles:&lt;/strong&gt; Styled components remove unused styles, even if they’re declared in your code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing styled components is easy. You can do it through a CDN or with a package manager such as Yarn… &lt;code&gt;yarn add styled-components&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our demo uses &lt;a href="https://create-react-app.dev/"&gt;create-react-app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starting-out" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starting Out
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the first thing you’ll notice about styled components is their syntax, which can be daunting if you don’t understand the magic behind styled components. To put it briefly, styled components use JavaScript’s &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"&gt;template literals&lt;/a&gt; to bridge the gap between components and styles. So, when you create a styled component, what you’re actually creating is a React component with styles. It looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import styled from "styled-components";

// Styled component named StyledButton
const StyledButton = styled.button`
  background-color: black;
  font-size: 32px;
  color: white;
`;

function Component() {
  // Use it like any other component.
  return &amp;lt;StyledButton&amp;gt; Login &amp;lt;/StyledButton&amp;gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;StyledButton&lt;/code&gt; is the styled component, and it will be rendered as an HTML button with the contained styles. styled is an internal utility method that transforms the styling from JavaScript into actual CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In raw HTML and CSS, we would have this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;button {
  background-color: black;
  font-size: 32px;
  color: white;
}

&amp;lt;button&amp;gt; Login &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adapting-based-on-props" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adapting Based On Props
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styled components are functional, so we can easily style elements dynamically. Let’s assume we have two types of buttons on our page, one with a black background, and the other blue. We do not have to create two styled components for them; we can adapt their styling based on their props.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import styled from "styled-components";

const StyledButton = styled.button`
  min-width: 200px;
  border: none;
  font-size: 18px;
  padding: 7px 10px;
  /* The resulting background color will be based on the bg props. */
  background-color: ${props =&amp;gt; props.bg === "black" ? "black" : "blue";
`;

function Profile() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;StyledButton bg="black"&amp;gt;Button A&amp;lt;/StyledButton&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;StyledButton bg="blue"&amp;gt;Button B&amp;lt;/StyledButton&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  )
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;StyledButton&lt;/code&gt; is a React component that accepts props, we can assign a different background color based on the existence or value of the &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt; prop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice, though, that we haven’t given our button a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s do that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function Profile() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;StyledButton bg="black" type="button"&amp;gt;
        Button A
      &amp;lt;/StyledButton&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;StyledButton bg="blue" type="submit" onClick={() =&amp;gt; alert("clicked")}&amp;gt;
        Button B
      &amp;lt;/StyledButton&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Styled components can differentiate between the &lt;a href="https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#passed-props"&gt;types of props&lt;/a&gt; they receive. They know that &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is an HTML attribute, so they actually render &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button type="button"&amp;gt;Button A&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, while using the &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt; prop in their own processing. Notice how we attached an event handler, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of attributes, an extended syntax lets us manage props using the &lt;a href="https://styled-components.com/docs/api#attrs"&gt;attrs constructor&lt;/a&gt;. Check this out:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const StyledContainer = styled.section.attrs((props) =&amp;gt; ({
  width: props.width || "100%",
  hasPadding: props.hasPadding || false,
}))`
  --container-padding: 20px;
  width: ${(props) =&amp;gt; props.width}; // Falls back to 100%
  padding: ${(props) =&amp;gt;
    (props.hasPadding &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "var(--container-padding)") || "none"};
`;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice how we don’t need a ternary when setting the width? That’s because we’ve already set a default for it with &lt;code&gt;width: props.width || "100%",&lt;/code&gt;. Also, we used &lt;a href="https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#passed-props"&gt;CSS custom properties&lt;/a&gt; because we can!&lt;/p&gt;
