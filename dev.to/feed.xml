      <description>&lt;p&gt;With AWS, customers can enable, provision, and operate their environment for both business agility and governance control. AWS provides services for end-to-end IT lifecycle management, helping customers control and secure their environments, reduce costs, simplify compliance, and enhance operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Blog Post, we will talk about AWS Management and Governance services. AWS Management and Governance services are built to manage highly dynamic cloud resources at massive scale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3m2xY2Lp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xgsyhswelcds85rbsp1t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3m2xY2Lp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xgsyhswelcds85rbsp1t.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Introduction to AWS&lt;/strong&gt; is a Series containing different articles that provide a basic introduction to different aws topics/categories. Each article covers the detailed guide on how to work with particular topic/category . This series aims at providing "A Getting Started Guide on Different aws topics / categories ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-management-and-governance-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Management and Governance Services
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers can use AWS Management and Governance services to assess their resource utilization and identify ways to reduce costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS reduces complexity, offering a single control plane for customers to manage and govern their resources on AWS and on-premises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS offers the broadest partner ecosystem for customers to extend and augment their management and governance system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usecases&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a centrally managed, secure, multi-account AWS environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your operations on AWS and on-premises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit and remediate your resource configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the health of infrastructure and applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build, provision, and share AWS and third-party resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transform your business with cost transparency, forecasting, and optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-cloudwatch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon CloudWatch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zhQY5qR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3uhgrb4anlef7k0te8k.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zhQY5qR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3uhgrb4anlef7k0te8k.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service built for developers, system operators, site reliability engineers (SRE), and IT managers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, understand and respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications and services that run on AWS, and on-premises servers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use CloudWatch to set high resolution alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to optimize your applications, and ensure they are running smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-auto-scaling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Auto Scaling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9JXrCorz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pnebrakm3eyi892j7b93.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9JXrCorz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pnebrakm3eyi892j7b93.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. The service provides a simple, powerful user interface that lets you build scaling plans for resources including Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, and Amazon Aurora Replicas. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them. If you’re already using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 instances, you can now combine it with AWS Auto Scaling to scale additional resources for other AWS services. With AWS Auto Scaling, your applications always have the right resources at the right time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-control-tower"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Control Tower
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cJhJk25r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t792nbhm49i790wb6ck1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cJhJk25r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t792nbhm49i790wb6ck1.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Control Tower automates the set-up of a baseline environment, or landing zone, that is a secure, well-architected multi-account AWS environment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The configuration of the landing zone is based on best practices that have been established by working with thousands of enterprise customers to create a secure environment that makes it easier to govern AWS workloads with rules for security, operations, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enterprises migrate to AWS, they typically have a large number of applications and distributed teams. They often want to create multiple accounts to allow their teams to work independently, while still maintaining a consistent level of security and compliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they use AWS’s management and security services, like AWS Organizations, AWS Service Catalog and AWS Config, that provide very granular controls over their workloads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to maintain this control, but they also want a way to centrally govern and enforce the best use of AWS services across all the accounts in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control Tower automates the set-up of their landing zone and configures AWS management and security services based on established best practices in a secure, compliant, multi-account environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distributed teams are able to provision new AWS accounts quickly, while central teams have the peace of mind knowing that new accounts are aligned with centrally established, company-wide compliance policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives you control over your environment, without sacrificing the speed and agility AWS provides your development teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-systems-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Systems Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Iu7YPW4n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m22z3rkcy6hox43qgvbj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Iu7YPW4n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m22z3rkcy6hox43qgvbj.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Systems Manager, you can group resources, like Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, or Amazon RDS instances, by application, view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting, and take action on your groups of resources. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-systems-manager-contains-the-following-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Systems Manager contains the following tools:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you create a logical group of resources associated with a particular workload such as different layers of an application stack, or production versus development environments. For example, you can group different layers of an application, such as the frontend web layer and the backend data layer. Resource groups can be created, updated, or removed programmatically through the API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights Dashboard:&lt;/strong&gt; Displays operational data that the AWS Systems Manager automatically aggregates for each resource group. Systems Manager eliminates the need for you to navigate across multiple AWS consoles to view your operational data. With Systems Manager you can view API call logs from AWS CloudTrail, resource configuration changes from AWS Config, software inventory, and patch compliance status by resource group. You can also easily integrate your Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards, AWS Trusted Advisor notifications, and AWS Personal Health Dashboard performance and availability alerts into your Systems Manager dashboard. Systems Manager centralizes all relevant operational data, so you can have a clear view of your infrastructure compliance and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run Command:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides a simple way of automating common administrative tasks like remotely executing shell scripts or PowerShell commands, installing software updates, or making changes to the configuration of OS, software, EC2 and instances and servers in your on-premises data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Manager:&lt;/strong&gt; Helps you define and maintain consistent OS configurations such as firewall settings and anti-malware definitions to comply with your policies. You can monitor the configuration of a large set of instances, specify a configuration policy for the instances, and automatically apply updates or configuration changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory:&lt;/strong&gt; Helps you collect and query configuration and inventory information about your instances and the software installed on them. You can gather details about your instances such as installed applications, DHCP settings, agent detail, and custom items. You can run queries to track and audit your system configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you define a recurring window of time to run administrative and maintenance tasks across your instances. This ensures that installing patches and updates, or making other configuration changes does not disrupt business-critical operations. This helps improve your application availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch Manager:&lt;/strong&gt; Helps you select and deploy operating system and software patches automatically across large groups of instances. You can define a maintenance window so that patches are applied only during set times that fit your needs. These capabilities help ensure that your software is always up to date and meets your compliance policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation:&lt;/strong&gt; Simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks, such as updating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Use the Automation feature to apply patches, update drivers and agents, or bake applications into your AMI using a streamlined, repeatable, and auditable process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameter Store:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides an encrypted location to store important administrative information such as passwords and database strings. The Parameter Store integrates with AWS KMS to make it easy to encrypt the information you keep in the Parameter Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributor:&lt;/strong&gt; Helps you securely distribute and install software packages, such as software agents. Systems Manager Distributor allows you to centrally store and systematically distribute software packages while you maintain control over versioning. You can use Distributor to create and distribute software packages and then install them using Systems Manager Run Command and State Manager. Distributor can also use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control who can create or update packages in your account. You can use the existing IAM policy support for Systems Manager Run Command and State Manager to define who can install packages on your hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session Manager:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides a browser-based interactive shell and CLI for managing Windows and Linux EC2 instances, without the need to open inbound ports, manage SSH keys, or use bastion hosts. Administrators can grant and revoke access to instances through a central location by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. This allows you to control which users can access each instance, including the option to provide non-root access to specified users. Once access is provided, you can audit which user accessed an instance and log each command to Amazon S3 or Amazon CloudWatch Logs using AWS CloudTrail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-cloudformation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS CloudFormation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2NiEK1j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i21ry7vmlai7pdvakwik.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2NiEK1j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i21ry7vmlai7pdvakwik.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the AWS CloudFormation sample templates or create your own templates to describe your AWS resources, and any associated dependencies or runtime parameters, required to run your application. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to figure out the order for provisioning AWS services or the subtleties of making those dependencies work. CloudFormation takes care of this for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the AWS resources are deployed, you can modify and update them in a controlled and predictable way, in effect applying version control to your AWS infrastructure the same way you do with your software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also visualize your templates as diagrams and edit them using a drag-and-drop interface with the AWS CloudFormation Designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-cloudtrail"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS CloudTrail
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pqIUC5-i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/id6koxoom9dykih0na7q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pqIUC5-i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/id6koxoom9dykih0na7q.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With CloudTrail, you can get a history of AWS API calls for your account, including API calls made using the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and higher-level AWS services (such as AWS CloudFormation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AWS API call history produced by CloudTrail enables security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-config"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Config
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7_buqcAx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ue3t7zm90mq9vnthyru9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7_buqcAx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ue3t7zm90mq9vnthyru9.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to enable security and governance. The Config Rules feature enables you to create rules that automatically check the configuration of AWS resources recorded by AWS Config.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AWS Config, you can discover existing and deleted AWS resources, determine your overall compliance against rules, and dive into configuration details of a resource at any point in time. These capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-opsworks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS OpsWorks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---G_BqC6_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uc186g9kow9a9hrruc11.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---G_BqC6_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uc186g9kow9a9hrruc11.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. Chef and Puppet are automation platforms that allow you to use code to automate the configurations of your servers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpsWorks has three offerings, AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise, and AWS OpsWorks Stacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-service-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Service Catalog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T_gxycwP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/471ifkcoh5oced1uruvh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T_gxycwP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/471ifkcoh5oced1uruvh.png" alt="Image description" width="202" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Service Catalog allows you to centrally manage commonly deployed IT services and helps you achieve consistent governance and meet your compliance requirements, while enabling users to quickly deploy only the approved IT services they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-trusted-advisor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AWS Console Mobile Application lets customers view and manage a select set of resources to support incident response while on-the-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Console Mobile Application allows AWS customers to monitor resources through a dedicated dashboard and view configuration details, metrics, and alarms for select AWS services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard provides permitted users with a single view a resource's status, with real-time data on Amazon CloudWatch, Personal Health Dashboard, and AWS Billing and Cost Management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can view ongoing issues and follow through to the relevant CloudWatch alarm screen for a detailed view with graphs and configuration options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, customers can check on the status of specific AWS services, view detailed resource screens, and perform select actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS License Manager makes it easier to manage licenses in AWS and on-premises servers from software vendors such as Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS License Manager lets administrators create customized licensing rules that emulate the terms of their licensing agreements, and then enforces these rules when an instance of Amazon EC2 gets launched. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrators can use these rules to limit licensing violations, such as using more licenses than an agreement stipulates or reassigning licenses to different servers on a short-term basis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rules in AWS License Manager enable you to limit a licensing breach by physically stopping the instance from launching or by notifying administrators about the infringement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administrators gain control and visibility of all their licenses with the AWS License Manager dashboard and reduce the risk of non-compliance, misreporting, and additional costs due to licensing overages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS License Manager integrates with AWS services to simplify the management of licenses across multiple AWS accounts, IT catalogs, and on-premises, through a single AWS account. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;License administrators can add rules in AWS Service Catalog, which allows them to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on all their AWS accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through seamless integration with AWS Systems Manager and AWS Organizations, administrators can manage licenses across all the AWS accounts in an organization and on-premises environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Marketplace buyers can also use AWS License Manager to track bring your own license (BYOL) software obtained from the Marketplace and keep a consolidated view of all their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The AWS Well-Architected Tool helps you review the state of your workloads and compares them to the latest AWS architectural best practices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tool is based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructure. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, has been used in tens of thousands of workload reviews conducted by the AWS solutions architecture team, and provides guidance to help implement designs that scale with application needs over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use this free tool, available in the AWS Management Console, just define your workload and answer a set of questions regarding operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AWS Well-Architected Tool then provides a plan on how to architect for the cloud using established best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the past, organizations have had to choose between innovating faster and maintaining control over cost, compliance, and security. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With AWS Management and Governance services, customers don’t have to choose between innovation and control—they can have both. * With AWS, customers can enable, provision, and operate their environment for both business agility and governance control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this guide helps you with the Introduction to Management, Governance and Migration with AWS- Part-1. In the next blog post, we will discuss some of the most important Migration services in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Symfony &amp; Database-Part 2</title>
      <author>hanane kacemi</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 10:11:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hananekacemi/symfony-database-part-2-9b6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hananekacemi/symfony-database-part-2-9b6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, we configured Symfony to use Docker for Database, in this post we will talk about Database creation(table, column...) using Doctrine and Symfony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-database-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create Database :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create a database with a simple command : &lt;code&gt;symfony console doctrine:database:create&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctrine is an &lt;strong&gt;ORM&lt;/strong&gt; (Object Relational Mapper) : Each Table in Database (ex:employee) has a corresponding class in our App (known as &lt;strong&gt;Entity&lt;/strong&gt;, ex : Employee.php) and each column of this table (ex:name) is related to a property of that class (ex: &lt;code&gt;private $name;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the entity class, run : &lt;code&gt;symfony console make:entity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New file is created under &lt;em&gt;src/Entity&lt;/em&gt; folder &lt;em&gt;(I like to run after each command &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; to check what has been generated by Symfony and access to the file to see its content)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;make:entity&lt;/code&gt; command can be used to create an new Entity or to update an existing one (add new property, a constraint...). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to create the table and its columns, we need to execute 2 commands, the 1st one is : &lt;code&gt;symfony console make:migration&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command compares the actual state of the database with all Entity classes, if an Entity is newly created or modified the command creates the query for that changes under &lt;em&gt;migrations&lt;/em&gt; folder in order to make database matches entities. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EewUp3SY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vtm80g9my4bajuqgsxqc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EewUp3SY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vtm80g9my4bajuqgsxqc.png" alt="query generated for table creation" width="880" height="542"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To execute this query, we run the 2nd command : &lt;code&gt;symfony console doctrine:migrations:migrate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symfony is smart enough :D to know if a query has already been executed : The migration system create a table in Database &lt;em&gt;doctrine_migration_versions&lt;/em&gt;  where it stores all migrations executed : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F10VT7__--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/982rcpkdgphkwgbtfv0o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F10VT7__--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/982rcpkdgphkwgbtfv0o.png" alt="content of doctrine_migration_versions" width="697" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and Have a nice day ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ParseJS. An easy function I made to tokenize things.</title>
      <author>Calin Baenen</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 09:45:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/baenencalin/parsejs-an-easy-function-i-made-to-tokenize-things-4e5o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/baenencalin/parsejs-an-easy-function-i-made-to-tokenize-things-4e5o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/CalinZBaenen/ParseJS"&gt;ParseJS on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to make a math evaluater? A programming language mockup? A document format? A file reader?&lt;br&gt;
If you want to make any of those, my small one-function library is for you! :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the function signature:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does it work?&lt;br&gt;
It takes a string to scan and a list of tokens. If a token is found; a symbol (&lt;code&gt;Symbol.for( tok )&lt;/code&gt;) is inserted, otherwise the character in the string being scanned is inserted -- and the final result is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the function in action!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4lyCXGGb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/06k063k9naql9t00h1rv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4lyCXGGb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/06k063k9naql9t00h1rv.png" alt="&amp;quot;Sonic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tails&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Knuckles&amp;quot; are all recognized as tokens, but &amp;quot;Amy&amp;quot; isn't." width="554" height="331"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Parses a string and returns a list consisting of one of
length-1-`string` (`char`) or `symbol`, representing the
tokens the scanner finds.
Every time a token is successfully found, a symbol
representing the token is inserted, otherwise
the current character is used instead.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Python Code Best Practices</title>
      <author>Dollar Dhingra</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 09:24:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dollardhingra/python-code-best-practices-4k96</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dollardhingra/python-code-best-practices-4k96</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is a collection of best practices for more idiomatic python code especially if you are new to python. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contribute"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contribute
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to &lt;a href="https://github.com/dollardhingra/dollardhingra.github.io/edit/master/_posts/2021-12-05-python-code-best-practices.md"&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt; to this list, and I will thank you by including a link to your profile with the snippet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-catching-exceptions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Catching Exceptions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sure-shot way to get your code into trouble&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# very bad practice
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;do_something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A slightly better way(included logging), but still a bad practice:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;do_something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# although, logging is a good practice
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# When we don't use `Exception` we will also be catching events like system exit. 
# So, using Exception means that we are only catching Exceptions.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A better way:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;do_something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# some code to handle your exception gracefully if required
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we have used a specific type of Exception i.e. &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-name-casing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Name Casing
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# using camelCase is not a convention in python
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sampleArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# instead use snake_case in python
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sample_arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In python, &lt;code&gt;snake_case&lt;/code&gt; is preferred for variables, functions and method names. However, for classes, &lt;code&gt;PascalCase&lt;/code&gt; is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-chained-comparison-operators"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Chained comparison operators
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways of comparing in Python:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Don't do this:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'x is greater than 0 but less than 10'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Instead, do this:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'x is greater than 0 but less than 10'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-mutable-default-arguments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Mutable default arguments
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# wrong way!
# a sure shot way to get some unintended bugs in your code
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# correct way!
# recommended way for handling mutable default arguments:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;box&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  5. String Formatting
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Avoid using it
# %-formatting
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"James Bond"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;profession&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Secret Agent"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, %s. You are a %s."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;profession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# slightly better
# str.format()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, {}. You are a {}."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;profession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Short, crisp and faster!
# f-strings
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;. You are a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;profession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The f in f-strings may as well stand for "fast." f-strings are faster than both %-formatting and str.format(). &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#abstract"&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  6. Top-level script environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executes only if it is run as a script and not as a module&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Filename: run.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'__main__'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello from script!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ python run.py
$ Hello from script!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello from script!&lt;/code&gt; will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be printed if the module is imported into any other module.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Can be reduced to this one:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  8. Iterating over an iterator
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t necessarily need to iterate over the indices of the elements in an iterator if you don’t need them. You can iterate directly over the elements.&lt;br&gt;
This makes your code more pythonic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;process_fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# good practice

  &lt;a href="#10-using-context-managers"&gt;

  10. Using context managers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python provides context managers that manage the overhead of initializing and clearing up the resources and let&lt;br&gt;
you focus on the implementation. For example in the case of reading a file, you don't need to be concerned &lt;br&gt;
to close the file manually.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"foo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, if you want to become a certified Python developer in 2022 then you have come to the right place. For long, I have been searching for a well recognized Python certification, similar to Oracle's &lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/how-to-become-a-certified-java-developer-professionals-1jfb"&gt;Java certification&lt;/a&gt; and Vmware's &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/spring-professional-certification-vmware-edu-1202-the-ultimate-guide-to-pass-spring-11dab8d311c3"&gt;Spring certification&lt;/a&gt;  but I didn't found any until  I stumbled upon Microsoft's Exam 98-381: Introduction to Programming Using Python, also known as MTA Python certification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I knew that Microsoft provides a lot of &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/11/top-10-azure-certifications-you-can-aim.html"&gt;Azure certification&lt;/a&gt; as well as SQL Server certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I didn't know that they have a Python certification as well so it was a pleasant surprise for me and in this guide, I will tell you how to prepare for this Python certification and become a Microsoft certified Python developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I will also share best resources like online courses and tutorials to prepare for this prestigious Python certification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I have shared the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-books-to-learn-python-in-2019.html#axzz6co28cbJC"&gt;best Python books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/03/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-2018.html"&gt;best online courses to learn Python&lt;/a&gt; and in this article, I am going to share the best online courses to prepare for this Python certification, but before that let's talk about why python programmer get a certification or whether this MTA Python certification 98-381 worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you want to get a professional career in the IT field and you are wondering what you should do in this situation I would highly recommend that you need recognizable certifications in your belt whether you want to be a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e"&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt; or a programmer in any language and python is absolutely one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/10-best-coursera-courses--for-python.html"&gt;Python online certifications&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them teach you the basics and others deep dive you into more advanced concepts. One of the best certifications that I really recommend you take is the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/98-381"&gt;Microsoft python certification (98--381) exam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This python certification is offered by Microsoft intended for really beginner users and the syllabus is containing the basics of this language such as data types and operators as well as inputs outputs and error handling and it does not teach you python instead it tests your skills and knowledge of this language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of this exam is $127 and supports many languages not just English such as Japanese, Chinese, German as well as French and more and has about 40 questions needed to be completed in 45 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is the most challenging part of this exam as you only have 45 minutes to solve this question which means just over 1 minute for each question and some questions can be lengthy to chew most of you time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stuck in one of them and you will how time flies but don't worry, I will share some tips and tactics to do well in this Python certification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will show you some online courses to learn python in depth so you can pass the exam in confidence as well as some online books if you like reading instead of watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-mta-python-certification-98381"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is MTA Python Certification 98-381?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most popular Python certification offer by none other than Microsoft itself. This exam test candidates' ability to recognize and write syntactically correct Python code, recognize data types supported by Python, and be able to recognize and write Python code that will logically solve a given problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exam is online and you will need to solve 40 questions in 45 minutes to pass this exam. The exam pattern is very similar to other Microsoft certification and you will questions in following format&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple choice questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple selection questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop-down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag &amp;amp; Drop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrange, Select &amp;amp; Place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, here is how your Python skills are measured in this exam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform Operations using Data Types and Operators (20-25%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control Flow with Decisions and Loops (25-30%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform Input and Output Operations (20-25%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document and Structure Code (15-20%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform Troubleshooting and Error Handling (5-10%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform Operations Using Modules and Tools (1-5%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the official exam guide says that you should have 100 hours of experience in Python coding and development's, its not a pre-requisite, as long as you can read and comprehended Python code you can give this exam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, remember this exam is going to retire next year in June 2022,  probably be replaced by another Python certification so it's a good time to get certified in Python to give yourself a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/python-201-interactively-learn-advanced-concepts-in-python-3?affiliate_id=5073518643380224"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XMHGOorp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.educative.io/v2api/collection/10370001/4795934408966144/image/6247615415451648" alt="Learn Functional Programming in Python - Learn Interactively" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Books
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the next suggestion which is another great book for learning python with no prior experience required to start and provides you with a student-friendly introduction to the fundamentals of this programming language and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#21-starting-out-with-python-book"&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts with a beginner introduction to how to code using python from variables loops if and else statements as usual in any python book or course and then moves to some advanced topics like classes and functions and object-oriented programming and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis/dp/0134444329/?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vDQqDaSJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8eWnfpUwAJA/YXgcVy71G8I/AAAAAAAAp-I/DylIOR6gRNUPbLKsR-vlTrNBzz9lB8H1ACLcBGAsYHQ/starting-out-python-5th-edition-pdf.jpg" alt="Best book to crack Python certification" width="399" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask about a Python book for beginners, a lot of people will recommend "Learn Python The Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw," and this happens to me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the books which were suggested to me by my Python buddy, but I didn't get a chance to look because I was more hooked with the "Automating Boring Stuff with Python" and "Head First Python" book. I did read it later and learned a lot from it as it fills many gaps in my learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading books from multiple authors also helps you to grasp the concept better because some explain one topic better while others explain other topics.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like Zed A. Shaw learning a hard way approach, then you will love this book. I also suggest combining this with this &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fpython-the-complete-python-developer-course%2F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python Programming MasterClass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914?tag=javamysqlanta-20"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ERF4d3L3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rNbgdi_AbYw/XSB7MDYbfKI/AAAAAAAAZlk/pUjQ5t4gd9gdKFEtxxxbtB5V13odP2UmQCEwYBhgL/w246-h320/Learn%252BPython%252BThe%252BHard%252BWay%252Bby%252BZed%252BA.%252BShaw.jpg" alt="best book to learn Python in depth" width="246" height="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now see some amazon best selling books that will prepare you to learn Python as a beginner and one of the best books that I will suggest is python for everybody and it was originally a course in &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/09/python-for-everybody-course-from-coursera-review.html#axzz6pXQD0ZSG"&gt;Coursera &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/05/top-10-edx-courses-and-certificates-for.html"&gt;edX &lt;/a&gt;but due to the success of this program, the author has created a book version of his course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book teaches you computer history and moving to python from variable data types if statements for loops and more of the basics then moving to use python for interacting with files and creating some projects involving scraping data from the web well as interacting with the databases and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a great course to learn Python in-depth and also prepare for this Python certification.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Practice Tests and Dumps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most important step on preparing Python certification because you need speed and accuracy to pass this certification. You need to solve 40 questions in 45 minutes which is not easy specially if you have not practiced mock tests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here are my favorite practice tests you can checkout to practice well before real exam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#31-microsoft-python-certification-exam-98381-practice-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3.1. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmicrosoft-python-certification-exam-98-381-practice-tests%2F"&gt;Microsoft Python Certification Exam (98--381)&lt;/a&gt; [Practice Test]
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you have mastered python at this point and you want to test the knowledge and skills then you probably need to check this question-based course in udemy containing around 200 questions separated into four parts and every part has 40 questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every part contains many questions about a certain topic like the first test has questions on variables as well as operations and data types and so on and the others will test your knowledge in the Flow-control functions error handling and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmicrosoft-python-certification-exam-98-381-practice-tests%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7EAIMfL9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UXltiTJq3Xk/YXgcFQRNwlI/AAAAAAAAp98/2CH8jpfytuMmSQG_LJwDnAxBCR1jOfpgwCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h175/10657-microsoft-python-certification-exam-98-381-practice-tests-806x440.jpg" alt="Best Practice test to crack Python certification" width="320" height="175"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;That's all about how to become a certified Python developer in 2022. These were the best courses and books that I recommend for anyone who wants to get the Microsoft python certificate 98-381 and get a professional career in this field and now you are one step to start making this goal come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you miss this exam then don't worry, this is not the only Python certification you have, there are still PCEP-30-01 and the PCAP-31-02 Exams which you can take become an industry ready certified python developer in 2022 &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/sachin26/strivers-sde-sheet-journey-1-set-matrix-zeroes-4l68</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi👋,devs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from today I have decided I am going to start a journey called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Striver's SDE Sheet Journey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and in this journey, I will solve all 180 problems and I will try to explain all the solutions in an understandable way or I should say that step by step so that you can easily understand the solutions.&lt;br&gt;
Throughout the journey, I will use java why java? because I feel comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is "&lt;strong&gt;Striver's SDE Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;" 🤔? &lt;a href="https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/"&gt;👀 here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my main purpose to start this Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- To improve my DSA Concepts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- To improve my code Quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- To continue my learning Journey&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- To Help to you Guys 😊&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;let's start with 1st problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-set-matrix-zeroes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1 Set Matrix Zeroes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this problem, we have given a 2D integer matrix and in this matrix if an element is 0 then we have to set its entire &lt;strong&gt;ROW&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;COLUMN&lt;/strong&gt; to 0's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;like this one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RU72Hy5C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0rmoxgnr58070muy7c76.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RU72Hy5C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0rmoxgnr58070muy7c76.jpeg" alt="" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;after spending half an hour I got this approach. let's discuss step by step&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; create two integer arrays(zeroRowIndexList &amp;amp; zeroColIndexList) which store the index of row and column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; traverse the matrix and add the index of row &amp;amp; column to the arrays(zeroRowIndexList &amp;amp; zeroColIndexList) if &lt;strong&gt;matrix[row][column] == 0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; set matrix's entire row to 0's according to zeroRowIndexList array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; set matrix's entire column to 0's according to zeroColIndexList array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's Dry run this approach with an example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-1&lt;/strong&gt; create two arrays &lt;code&gt;zeroRowIndexList=[ ]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;zeroColIndexList=[ ]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-2&lt;/strong&gt; traverse the matrix and add index of row &amp;amp; column to the arrays(zeroRowIndexList,zeroColIndexList) if &lt;strong&gt;matrix[row][col] == 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  at matrix[0,0] == 0 is false
  at matrix[0,1] == 0 is false
  .
  .
  at matrix[1,1] == 0 is true 
  then add index of row &amp;amp; col to the arrays e.g. zeroRowIndexList=[1],zeroColIndexList=[1]
  at matrix[1,2] == 0 is false
  at matrix[2,2] == 0 is false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-3&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;code&gt;zeroRowIndexList[1]&lt;/code&gt; array, set matrix's rows to 0's&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-4&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;code&gt;zeroColIndexList[1]&lt;/code&gt; array, set matrix's columns to 0's&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-5&lt;/strong&gt; end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAVA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;java.util.ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Solution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;setZeroes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[][]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;zeroRowIndexList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;zeroColIndexList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cols&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                 &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complexity Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Complexity&lt;/em&gt; :- &lt;strong&gt;O(rows*cols)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Space Complexity&lt;/em&gt; :- &lt;strong&gt;O(rows+cols)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;other approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algo #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;instead of creating two separate arrays we can use the matrix's first row &amp;amp; first column as markers.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
let's see how&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; create two boolean variable called &lt;strong&gt;isFirstRowHas0&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;isFirstColHas0&lt;/strong&gt; and set to false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; traverse the matrix and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2.1) if matrix[row][col] == 0 then &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3.1) if row == firstRow then set isFirstRowHas0 to true&lt;br&gt;
(3.2) if col == firstCol then set isFirstColHas0 to true&lt;br&gt;
(3.3) mark corresponding 1st row &amp;amp; 1st column to 0 &lt;br&gt;
     e.g. matrix[firstRow][col] == 0 &amp;amp; matrix[row][firstCol] == 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; again traverse the matrix from matrix[2ndRow][2ndCol] and set 0 if matrix[firstRow][col] == 0 or matrix[row][firstCol] == 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check if isFirstRowHas0 is true then set 1stRow to 0's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check if isFirstColHas0 is true then set 1stCol to 0's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-1&lt;/strong&gt; initialised two boolean variable isFirstRowHas0,isFirstColHas0 and set to false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;isFirstRowHas0 = false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;isFirstColHas0 = false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-2&lt;/strong&gt; traverse the matrix till the end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2.1) at matrix[0,0] == 0 is false&lt;br&gt;
..&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) at matrix[1,1] == 0 is true then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3.1) if 1 == 0 is false &lt;br&gt;
(3.2) if 1 == 0 is false &lt;br&gt;
(3.3) matrix[firstRow][1] = 0 &amp;amp; matrix[1][firstCol] = 0&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) at matrix[2,2] loop end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-3&lt;/strong&gt; again traverse the matrix from matrix[2ndRow][2ndCol]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at matrix[1,1] if matrix[firstRow][1] == 0 or matrix[row][firstCol] == 0 is true then set matrix[1,1] = 0&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at matrix[1,2] if matrix[firstRow][2] == 0 or matrix[1][firstCol] == 0 is true then set matrix[1,2] = 0&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at matrix[2,1] if matrix[firstRow][1] == 0 or matrix[row][firstCol] == 0 is true then set matrix[2,1] = 0&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-4&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;firstRowHas0 == true&lt;/code&gt; is false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-5&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;code&gt;firstColHas0 == true&lt;/code&gt; is false&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complexity Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Complexity&lt;/em&gt; :- &lt;strong&gt;O(rows*cols)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Space Complexity&lt;/em&gt; :- &lt;strong&gt;O(1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Algo #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;in this approach, i assume that &lt;strong&gt;-11&lt;/strong&gt; will not occur in the matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;traverse the matrix and if matrix[row][col] == 0 then set entire row &amp;amp; col to -11 if &lt;strong&gt;matrix[row][col] != 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.1) set entire row to -11 if matrix[row][col] != 0&lt;br&gt;
(1.2) set entire column to -11 if matrix[row][col] != 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;again traverse the matrix and replace all -11 to 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dry Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;step-1&lt;/strong&gt; traverse the matrix&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at matrix[0][0] if matrix[0][0] == 0 is false&lt;br&gt;
..&lt;br&gt;
at matrix[1][1] if matrix[1][1] == 0 is true then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.1) set entire row to -11 if matrix[1][col] != 0&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1.2) set entire column to -11&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            &lt;span class="n"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dummyInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>JavaScript for Beginners - Chapter 7: Functions</title>
      <author>Danish Saleem</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/mrdanishsaleem/javascript-for-beginners-chapter-7-functions-4fj1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mrdanishsaleem/javascript-for-beginners-chapter-7-functions-4fj1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another chapter in the JavaScript for beginners’ series! In this chapter we cover functions, what they are used for and how to write them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; is a way to encapsulate a portion of your code so a specific action can be reused and called on to run at a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#declaration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Declaration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of what the syntax to declare a function looks like.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#naming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Naming
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;functions&lt;/code&gt; are actions their &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is usually a &lt;code&gt;verb&lt;/code&gt;. Keep the names brief but accurate to describe what the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; does.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Shows a message&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Returns the age&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;calcSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Calculates the sum and returns the result&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Creates and returns a form&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkPermission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Check a permission, returns true/false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#arguments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Arguments
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; can require you to pass some &lt;code&gt;arguments (agrs)&lt;/code&gt; which act as variable within the function. This allows for better &lt;code&gt;reusability&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calcAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;birthYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentYear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;birthYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myAge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calcAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1989&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: 32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;johnAge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calcAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1975&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: 46&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#local-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Local Variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt; declared inside a function will only be visible within the function scope.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Local variable&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output: Error! - Variable is local to the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#return-a-value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Return a Value
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;function can return a value - usually one generated or manipulated by the function code.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;movieAgeLimit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Alternative: return age &amp;gt;= movieAgeLimit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasAccess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasAccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Enjoy the movie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;You are not old enough for this movie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#call-another-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Call another Function
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be used to perform an &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; or call another &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yourName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;What is your name?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showWelcomeMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Welcome &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showWelcomeMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yourName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; names tend to be &lt;code&gt;verbs&lt;/code&gt; to easily describe what the function does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Arguments&lt;/code&gt; are values you can pass to be used within a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Local Variables&lt;/code&gt; declared within a &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; are only visible within the &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; can &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; or call another &lt;code&gt;function / action&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;functions&lt;/code&gt; to store &lt;code&gt;reusable&lt;/code&gt; code that can be called as and when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;

      <title>Web Developer, why become one?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web development, you must have heard of this word before and specially if you're from some technical background.&lt;br&gt;
But what does this mean?&lt;br&gt;
The websites you see are made by Web-developers of course you must have seen, everyone knows about them, they are like pages that show some information and more.&lt;br&gt;
Well in 2021 almost everyone is familiar with programming and many are even learning some languages, but no matter how good programmer you are, you can't ignore web. Now by this I don't mean that web-developers are not programmers but there is a thin grey line between both in my opinion. What people know about both of them is that they earn a considerable amount which satisfactory to hear but the efforts behind that comfort is HUGE!&lt;br&gt;
Web-developers are in every company you see today even in startups because everyone needs that page for themselves. So now you might think how can one call himself a web-developer is there some sort of degree that one needs to do?&lt;br&gt;
Well no, there are many tutorials and guides out there on the internet and many communities that beginner friendly that love to help beginners and guide them through their journey, please note that I'm not referring to some paid courses or any sort of promotion, it's just for guidance.&lt;br&gt;
Hope this was inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advent of code Day 11</title>
      <author>Marco Servetto</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 07:02:26 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a nice puzzle, I appreciate the short input, so that I can simply cut-pasting into a multiline string.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks to this experience I'm getting more and more feedback on what I should add to AdamsTowel. See after the code for details:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;reuse [L42.is/AdamsTowel]
Split={class method S.List (S that)=\()(
  for c in that.replace(S"" with=S",").split(S",")\add(c)
  )}
Matrix=Collection.matrix(I.List,row=10I,col=10I)
Coords = Collection.list(Matrix.Coord)
Near={class method Coords (Matrix.Coord that) = Coords()(
  for r in Range(I"-1" to=2I)
    for c in Range(I"-1" to=2I)
      if r!=0I || c!=0I (
        new = that.with(row=\row+r).with(col=\col+c)
        catch error Any _ void
        \add(new)
        )
  )}
Step={
  class method I (mut Matrix that)=(
    for var v in that ( v+=1I )
    \flashes(m=that)
    )
  class method I flashes(mut Matrix m) = {
    flashes=Match.Count()(
      for c in m.coords() var v in m if v&amp;gt;9I (
        \add(\.true())
        v:=0I
        for n in Near(c) (
          vi = m.val(n) 
          if vi!=0I m.set(n val=vi+1I)
          )
        ))
    if flashes==0I return 0I
    return flashes+\flashes(m=m)
    }
  }
Main11=(
  input=S"""
    |3113284886
    |2851876144
    |2774664484

    |8152175168
  """
  m1=Matrix(\()(for l in input.split(S.nl())
    for s in Split(l) \add(I(string=s))))
  var tot = 0I
  for i in Range(100I) ( tot+=Step(m1) )
  Debug(tot)//1705  
  m2=Matrix(\()(for l in input.split(S.nl())
    for s in Split(l) \add(I(string=s))))
  for i in Range.unbounded() if Step(m2)==100I (
    Debug(i+1I)//of course the puzzle wants it
    Break()//starting from one, so 265 not 264 :-/
    )
  )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splitting on all characters seams to be very common, so I should add it to my spliterators.
for example we could have
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;m1=Matrix(\()(for l in input.split(S.nl())
    for s in l.split() \add(I(string=s))))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near elements of matrixes are quite a common feature too,
ideally I would like to allow either:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (coord,val) in myCoord.near8(map) ( .. ) //or near4()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for coord in myCoord.near8() val in map.near8(myCoord) ( .. )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What would be better? the first one requires boxing objects, the second requires two iterations and thus double checks for what coordinates actually are in the range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I change Match.Count to offer \addOne,\addIf(Bool that) \add(I that) and may be other operations like \times and \divide ? 
If so, that would remove the need to make an Accumulator for I... but what about Num and Math.Long? or even Math.Double??
That is, do we want to write
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;res=Double.Count()( for v in list (\add(v) \times(2\) )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;res=Match.CountDouble()( for v in list (\add(v) \times(2\) )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
