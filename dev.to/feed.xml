      <title>I like Svelte but...!</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/babakfp/i-like-svelte-but-14c0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;br&gt;
Honestly, I do like &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev"&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; (SvelteJS, Svelte Framework) but there is a big problem...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6851"&gt;PR request&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;it got me blocked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story is that &lt;strong&gt;the community is toxic&lt;/strong&gt;. You can find really good people &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/chat"&gt;(Svelte discord group)&lt;/a&gt; but a single &lt;code&gt;!good&lt;/code&gt; person can ruin everything (It's more that 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-is-my-deleted-comment-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This is my deleted comment content:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Rich-Harris Hey, you may want to read this🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He means Accessibility: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is my changes 100% accessible?😂 Such a silly question!. Let me ask, is the Svelte site 100% accessible? Let me answer, it doesn't even cover the basics. Now I'm confused because I didn't see any PR's from you related to accessibility. Why is that?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't know what accessibility is. Maybe you do because you sent me a wiki link about it😂.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't care about accessibility but you mention it in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you (@dummdidumm) look at the commits? I'm sure you didn't because then you would know that I know what the heck accessibility is and I spend a good time making sure that it's accessible. But you didn't bother yourself, did you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;previous commenters, they didn't look at what is changed, didn't look at the code, not even comments, and not even the commits. "Oh you did this but I don't know why!", You would know why, if you just take your time to review instead of questioning me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you (@dummdidumm) for the article, but it's not related, because you don't use a select box for page navigation😂. It's like using a banana🍌 instead of a telephone📞.  Just because it was used before, it doesn't mean that you need to keep it🙂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has keyboard navigation support. It's not a select box, so we don't need to use aria stuff like how explained in that article. I should have used nav. It's a hardcode test, it's not a community project. If you do something wrong, if the maintainers don't like you or for any reason, you'll be failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because Microsoft, Apple did something, it doesn't mean that it's right. I'm sure some people going to say "Oh you think you are smarter than Apple and Microsoft?" 😂 Let's don't fool ourselves. Those products have problems that we are all faced with. Even there are some problems that they didn't fix since years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re the bottom buttons, I'm not sure if the change is needed, since the previous styles are also consistently used in other pages.&lt;br&gt;
@bluwy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not gonna explain that how horrible the old buttons are.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/babakfp"&gt;@babakfp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do, else this is just personal preference which is no good argument, because I for example actually like the previous version better.&lt;br&gt;
@dummdidumm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Hey, explain this thing to someone that didn't bother to read the commits, or to someone that didn't even read the code comments"&lt;br&gt;
No thanks😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. @pngwn, if you see any problem in the code, you kindly ask the author to do the fixes (and of course you explain the problems and why and how). You don't just close the PR. There is 100 open PR's and you just couldn't help yourself not to close this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we don't want to introduce unnecessary dependencies for simple functionality like 'click outside'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, just reinvent the wheels because who knows, you just don't like adding packages👏. Hearing this from someone that uses Svelte!🙂 (Not good for Svelte😂). "Oh, it's not good to import a 20 line pure Svelte component package into your project, it's very bad". Don't let MR. Rich sees it🙂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd encourage you to open an issue before making pull requests like this. Closing until that conversation has taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sawed a problem and I solved it. What is the need for an extra step? You can analyze my PR with the current version and in any subject, it is way much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why it has to be like this with the Svelte community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I designed a UI and a logo for the SvelteKit and sent them into discord chat (it's related topic/group). Some users came and say their opinions. Didn't like any of them but as I said, they were an opinion with some more or less reason behind it. I and other users talk about this stuff and suddenly I see the cat removed. As you guessed, I was completely removed from the community🙂🙂. [🖕🏿] mail this to the person that removed me. Thanks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two times or so, I asked a question on discord community and got replies like (You have a problem if you are trying to do just think/task. No one in the world does that, so you have a problem, and...)🙂.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to play with SvelteKit source and see what's up... My hours of time were wasted because of the poor documentation. I created a PR and explained very well, step by step to how to set up Svelte to develop it. Literally, some people came and said (Ah I don't understand it, the old version was better). &lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2399"&gt;You can be the judge&lt;/a&gt;. Then a maintainer came and applied his own version. Yes, the old version became better but it's not the same. I was the one having the problem, not a monster senior developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I created this PR. Someone take his time to help and in the end he gets such a feedback. IT'T NOT SO GRAT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And what I see, I got removed from the discord community again (my second account). I wasn't even active on discord for the last few days. What happened? YOU DO THE MATH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENT END'S HERE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the PR request from &lt;a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/6851"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Database says NOPE</title>
      <author>Matthew</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 20:04:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mtfoley/database-says-nope-41p0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mtfoley/database-says-nope-41p0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/SXOdjPojfeOXzgc0J1/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/SXOdjPojfeOXzgc0J1/giphy.gif" alt="password"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href="https://virtualcoffee.io"&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt; last week and they have this awesome zoom meeting that members occasionally spin up for pairing and coworking. A great dev named &lt;a href="https://github.com/LincolnFleet"&gt;Travis Martin&lt;/a&gt; was adapting an existing project that had an app bundled with a Postgres v9 DB in a docker context, and he was trying to redeploy it in a different context with a newer version of Postgres.  At the point I joined the zoom meeting, the app was having trouble authenticating to Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked with a few different databases before, and I'd contributed to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Team-TAU/tau"&gt;TAU project&lt;/a&gt; in the past which uses Django and Postgres.  As I tried to make suggestions, I referred to a few of the bootstrapping scripts I encountered on that project, and they helped to some degree of making sure all the pieces were in place in the database server (pasted below):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if user exists: &lt;code&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM pg_catalog.pg_user WHERE usename={db_user}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if database exists: &lt;code&gt;SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM pg_database WHERE datname={db_name}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create the database if needed: &lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE {db_name};&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create the user if needed: &lt;code&gt;CREATE USER {db_user} WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '{db_pw}';&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assign privileges: &lt;code&gt;GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE {db_name} TO {db_user}; # use with care&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update user password if needed: &lt;code&gt;ALTER USER {db_user} WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '{db_pw}'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after using statements like these to make sure the DB server was setup correctly, we still were getting the same error message. Travis verified all sorts of things, like whether the app had access to the environment variables he wanted. We had a big clue when he attempted to authenticate to the Postgres over the &lt;code&gt;psql&lt;/code&gt; command with the app's credentials, and he didn't get an opportunity to enter a password.  The trick turned out to be that he was logged into the OS with the same username, configured earlier in the deployment process. As we got to reading further in the &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/auth-pg-hba-conf.html"&gt;Postgres docs&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the Postgres configuration file &lt;code&gt;pg_hba.conf&lt;/code&gt; had the authentication method set to "ident", which relies on a separate &lt;br&gt;
"ident" service, and in order to get things working, Travis set the authentication method to different option more appropriate for clients leveraging usernames and encrypted passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty specific use case, but maybe it'll help somebody!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How React Works Under The Hood</title>
      <author>Kingsley Ubah</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:38:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ubahthebuilder/how-react-works-under-the-hood-1jbg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ubahthebuilder/how-react-works-under-the-hood-1jbg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does React actually work beyond the syntactic sugar?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has dominated my thoughts for a very long time. My curiosity led me into carrying out a deep research on React, and my findings were quite interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My quest to demystify React was one of the most eye-opening things I have ever undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you also interested in finding out how React really works under the hood then you’re at the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to share some of my interesting discoveries about the inner workings of React, in regards to the rendering process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-the-dom-and-essence-of-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML, The DOM and Essence of React
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that a web page is structured using HTML. Hence, web pages are basically HTML Documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HTML document can be modified through an API called the DOM using methods like &lt;code&gt;querySelectorAll()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getElementsById()&lt;/code&gt; and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After modification, the web browser has to re render the page to reflect those changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this process is very expensive for the web browser to undertake. So if you have a page which changes regularly (aka a dynamic web page), then directly manipulating the DOM would be very inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is slower to repaint the DOM than it to create 10,000 objects with JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact predicates the existence and usefulness of React as a library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React provides you with a declarative way to create user interfaces. In other words, you don’t have to specify how exactly you want your web page to be rendered, or how the elements should be inserted. Instead you are more concerned with what elements to create and describing how they should look and behave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-elements-are-just-objects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React Elements are just Objects
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may or may not have known this, but React is just a tree of JavaScript objects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the following functional component:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;World&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In React, a component is a class or function which describes the UI which you want to create on your webpage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A React element is basically a description of the UI which you ultimately want to insert into the DOM. Hence, a React element is not a DOM element until the &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; method of the ReactDOM library is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a component is called from a Parent, React will call the &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; method on that child element and return a React element, which is just a plain object with certain properties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, calling the above functional component actually returns the following object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$$typeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The object contains certain properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a reference to the type of tag used. If an in-built DOM HTML element (such as main, div etc) is used, then the type points to the string representation of that DOM element. But if you import a custom React component using the typical &lt;code&gt;import ...&lt;/code&gt; syntax, then you are referencing to a component element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt;: This property is used to identify an element amongst other children using unique values. This is usually when iterating over a list of children elements.&lt;br&gt;
Ref: a reference to an actual DOM node.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;typeOf&lt;/strong&gt;: The value of this property is always a symbol. Symbol is a JacaScipt data type introduced in ES6. The object takes in a value and returns a unique symbol. In the case of React, the Symbol object takes in a react.element. This is a protection feature against cross-scripting attacks. The feature  is used a identify React elements to avoid scenarios where malicious values is passed to React.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;props&lt;/strong&gt;: This contains all of the elements children. If the component has multiple children, then the children property will be an array instead of an object. Each object has the same set of properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this object is what we call the &lt;strong&gt;virtual DOM&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of building up these objects is significantly cheaper than directly writing to the DOM. So instead of making direct modifications to the DOM, we can create a virtual DOM and make modifications on that object tree instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React creates a tree of elements whenever the render function is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reconciliation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reconciliation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconciliation houses the diffing algorithm which determines what part of the tree we should replace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, this is how React reconciles the DOM tree with the React element tree when a change is made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diffing algorithm is the way which we can tell difference between the two trees and determine what parts of the tree we need to replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important behaviour of React is how it reacts to type change on the top-level (root) element. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a case, React tears down the whole element tree and builds up a new tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; tag were to change to a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; tag, then React will destroy the entire tree along with the DOM nodes. The following will also happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All old component instance (in &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;) will receive componentWillUnmount and equivalent useEffect hook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New component tree will be built up with &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; as root element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;React will start rerendering again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New nodes will inserted to the DOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New components will receive componentWillMont and then ComponentDidMount and their useEffects hook will run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old props and state (for div) will be discarded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is only a property change, then React will only update  the changed property, and not tear down the entire tree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So assuming we are moving from one product item to another product item as in the code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProductList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&amp;gt; /&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Five&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ProductList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProductList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&amp;gt; /&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Six&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ProductList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;React will maintain the same component instances, pass in a new &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; props and then rerender so we navigate to a different page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#children"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Children
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a list of and we insert a new movie to the beginning of the list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;New&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;React has no way of knowing that a changes has occurred and where exactly the change happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, React would tear down the tree and rebuild a new tree, but this is highly inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you should pass a unique value to the key property of each child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React will recursively check for the unique values of the key properties and compare them. That way, it will know where on the list to insert the new item.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;New&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rendering-to-the-dom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rendering to the DOM
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This process triggers the reconciliation process which builds up the DOM tree, the React element tree and the entire diffing process. Then React eventually inserts the React Component tree into the Browser DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that React Elements are just regular objects. For all nested component, React generates a tree of objects which makes up the virtual DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When then make updates on the virtual DOM through a process known as reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a unique ID in React JS</title>
      <author>Saleh-Mubashar</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:37:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/salehmubashar/create-a-unique-id-in-react-js-3f75</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/salehmubashar/create-a-unique-id-in-react-js-3f75</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys&lt;br&gt;
Ok so in this post I will be giving you guys&lt;br&gt;
the simple steps to create a unique reference&lt;br&gt;
ID in react JS.&lt;br&gt;
This has many uses such as giving a user uploaded&lt;br&gt;
image a unique name for saving in a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;UUID&lt;/strong&gt; v4 using the following command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install uuidv4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import the package into your component, page or code etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;uuid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now assign the Uinique ID to any variable using the below code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nameref is an example here, it can be any variable name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nameRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And voila!, you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks you all for reading this post.&lt;br&gt;
If it was helpful, please consider following :)&lt;br&gt;
Until next time&lt;br&gt;
Bye! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using the new JavaScript .at() method</title>
      <author>Matt Angelosanto</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:18:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/logrocket/using-the-new-javascript-at-method-7k6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/logrocket/using-the-new-javascript-at-method-7k6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written by &lt;a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/author/ibadehinmojeed/"&gt;Ibadehin Mojeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ✏️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method was introduced in the August release of the ECMA International TC39’s relative indexing proposal to allow developers to grab elements based on their indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting elements in JavaScript is a common occurrence in development, but, before the introduction of the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, JavaScript had existing methods and techniques to select elements or characters from the start or end of lists or within a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bracket notation, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, is commonly used to get an element at a specific index. But, this has its drawbacks. For instance, we cannot use a negative index syntax like &lt;code&gt;arr[-1]&lt;/code&gt; to access the last item in a list, which has become popular in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, developers resort to using the &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; method and the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property to grab items from the end of a list. Nonetheless, they also have their respective drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we’ll look at the JavaScript &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, its use cases, and how it can improve developers’ experiences compared to preexisting methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-indexable-object-prototype"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The indexable object prototype
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method is located on the &lt;a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/interfaces-in-typescript-what-are-they-and-how-do-we-use-them-befbc69b38b3/#indexable-properties-interfaces"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototype&lt;/code&gt;of indexable objects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These objects, which can formulate index entries, include classes like &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;TypedArray&lt;/code&gt;, which are &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.at()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String.prototype.at()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;%TypedArray%.prototype.at()&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, we can perform the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method directly on these indexable objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#existing-methods-for-getting-list-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Existing methods for getting list elements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the benefits of the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, we will quickly walk through some of the existing methods for comparison purposes. This will also serve as a refresher for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider an array of elements called &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By using the bracket notation, &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, on the &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; array, we can get an element at a specific index. For instance, &lt;code&gt;arr[0]&lt;/code&gt; returns the first element, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. But, to get an item from the end of an unknown length, we use the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property or the &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-raw-length-endraw-property"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property’s syntax is written as the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; equals the nth element from the end of a list, and by using the syntax, we can grab any element from the end of that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following code, we use the syntax to grab the last element of the &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This works fine, but the syntax can be inconvenient and tedious for a simple task. Besides, one of its drawbacks when working with the returned value of a function compels us to first store the returned value in a variable before applying the syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempArr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code above, the returned value of the &lt;code&gt;appendNumber()&lt;/code&gt; function is first stored in the &lt;code&gt;tempArr&lt;/code&gt; variable before the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property is applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-slice-endraw-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; method
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers can also &lt;a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/javascript-array-methods/slice"&gt;employ the &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; to grab the last item of a list using the following syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This syntax allows a negative index, something you’ll see in the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method later in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative index here indicates an offset from the end of the array. For instance, &lt;code&gt;slice(-1)&lt;/code&gt; removes the last item from the back and returns a new array; &lt;code&gt;slice(-2)&lt;/code&gt; removes the last two, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here, the focus is on the last item, hence &lt;code&gt;slice(-1)&lt;/code&gt; in the syntax. Then, the &lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;/code&gt; notation selects the item at that index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the syntax, we can grab the last item of the &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; array like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property above, this method does not force us to store the returned value of a function before using the syntax. Hence making it more flexible:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the syntax looks odd and doesn’t portray its intention. And of course, it can be inconvenient as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-not-access-the-last-array-element-with-raw-arr1-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why not access the last array element with&lt;code&gt;arr[-1]&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question often comes up from JavaScript beginners, especially if they come from a programming language like Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;arr[-1]&lt;/code&gt; notation in JavaScript is a valid object property. Remember everything in JavaScript, including arrays, are objects. So anytime we use the bracket notation, for instance, &lt;code&gt;arr[0]&lt;/code&gt;, we reference the property of the object with the key &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By rewriting the &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; array in the object notation, we have something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, we don’t have a key &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;. So, &lt;code&gt;arr[-1]&lt;/code&gt; returns a value of &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. If the object property has a key &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, as seen in the code below, &lt;code&gt;arr[-1]&lt;/code&gt; returns its corresponding value:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: valid&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means we can’t use the &lt;code&gt;arr[-1]&lt;/code&gt; to grab the last element because it’s a valid syntax already. To use the negative index syntax to return an element from the end of a list, we will use the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-at-endraw-syntax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; syntax
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; syntax, it receives an index of an item to return. When passing a negative index, it counts from the end of the list or string and returns the item or character found. Else, it returns &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-at-endraw-method-in-practice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method in practice
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method receives an index of the item to return. In this section, we will cover its use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; array and see how the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method allows us to seamlessly return an index element:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: "three"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a positive index passes to the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, it returns the element at that index. For a negative index, it counts back from the last element in the list and returns the element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, &lt;code&gt;at(-1)&lt;/code&gt; counts one from the end of the array and returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, which is the element found. In the same way, &lt;code&gt;at(-3)&lt;/code&gt; counts three from the end and returns &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like arrays, we can do the same for strings:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The last alphabet is z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: T&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: z&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see, this method is pleasant to use. With just &lt;code&gt;.at(-1)&lt;/code&gt;, we get the last character of the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; string. If we did the same task with the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property, we would have a longer syntax, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: z&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-with-the-returned-value-of-a-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working with the returned value of a function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, unlike the &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt; property, does not compel us to store the returned value of a function in a variable before we can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following code outputs the last element pushed to an array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code, the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method applies directly to the returned value without first storing the value in a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-at-endraw-method-accepts-numbers-with-a-decimal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method accepts numbers with a decimal
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a number with a decimal passes to the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, it considers the value before the decimal point and returns the item at that index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: 5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the code above, the first console outputs the item at the &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; index while the second console counts three from the end of the array and outputs the found item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beneficial when we want to randomly select an index element. This can be demonstrated with a rock-paper-scissors game project. We can use the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method syntax to determine a random selection for the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following code illustrates how we can apply the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method to randomly select the computer’s choice:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;computerOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;rock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;paper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scissors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;computerOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;computerOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjHvoUBA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/rock-paper-scissors-generator.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjHvoUBA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/rock-paper-scissors-generator.png" alt='Rock-Paper-Scissors Generator Showing "Paper," "Rock,""Paper"'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/wonderful-river-dttqe?file=/script.js"&gt;Try it yourself on CodeSandbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/building-random-number-generator-javascript-nodejs/"&gt;With&lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we get a floating-point number between &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (inclusive) and the array length. Then, when the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method receives this floating-point number as an index, it considers the value before the decimal point and returns the element at that index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the square bracket notation for the same task is not possible unless we first floor the random number (that is, round the number down to the nearest integer), as seen in the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;computerOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;computerOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is because the bracket notation returns an &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; value for numbers with decimals:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Expected Output: undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method saves us the extra steps of using &lt;code&gt;Math.floor&lt;/code&gt; to floor a random number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#browser-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Browser support
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this tutorial, the &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method works pretty well with the popular modern browsers, except a few. See &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_array_at"&gt;browser support here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WxQFIzLJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/at-browser-support.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WxQFIzLJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/at-browser-support.png" alt="Browser Support For Using The At() Method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.at()&lt;/code&gt; method, as we have seen in this tutorial, is pleasant when grabbing items based on their index. It is also concise to use compared to the preexisting methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How we created a web-based typing experiment</title>
      <author>Lyokolux</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:10:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lyokolux/how-we-created-a-web-based-typing-experiment-1mdk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lyokolux/how-we-created-a-web-based-typing-experiment-1mdk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had little time, an experience to build and now to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-goal-of-the-experiment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🎯 The goal of the experiment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to determine the optimal way to display and to type alphanumeric sequences (such as identifiers, order numbers, etc.). According to research in cognitive psychology, it is easier to read and copy elements that are grouped in chunks of 2 or 3, rather than placed one after the other without grouping. Can we prove it ?&lt;br&gt;
So we made a tiny app everyone can try: &lt;a href="https://ux-typing-experiment-five.vercel.app"&gt;https://ux-typing-experiment-five.vercel.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%8F%9B-how-we-created-it-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏛 How we created it ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had 3 well-known challenges to build this project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a web interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;store the data of the experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a little time dedicated to it :'(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of web framework around here (Vue, React, ...Angular) but we wanted to try something different and new. As Svelte becomes well-tooled, we wanted to give it a try. Its minimalist architecture, while being efficient, convinced us. The learning curve is fast. Perfect ! Add a slider and here we go to design each pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting the data must be fast and easy. The free tier of Firestore fits our need for this project. Drawing and setup a relational database was overkill for it. Its document-based approach to store data is efficient for our need. One user: one document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we deploy the whole project with Vercel. It is easy, fast and already automated. Moreover Vercel deploy the app for every Pull Request, allowing to make a quick test on the user interface. Thanks for it Vercel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a summary of it. Here some highlights on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  🚧 Some obstacles that we met and how we solved them
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;svelte-i18n&lt;/code&gt; is not reactive. So we stored the i18n keys instead of their value in the objects that we pass around the components. The translated string is handled directly in the view with &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev/docs#Text_expressions"&gt;text expression&lt;/a&gt;. Okay ¯\&lt;em&gt;(ツ)&lt;/em&gt;/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixing reactivity inside a callback is no good idea. We don't know why but a reactive value inside a callback was not updated on time on keypress. Moving it into a reactive statement solved the problem (see: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Lyokolux/ux-typing-experiment/commit/adcedf5ad8061de89bb641fd0d8a867e1214afa4"&gt;#adcedf5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing the first input on the next slide is a must-have for such an experience. It was not so trivial as we thought. We ended up with a small-efficient function, leveraging the Javascript power of DOM manipulation 😅💪 (see: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Lyokolux/ux-typing-experiment/blob/2d6e441572100af3693d4af59cf73311f2c44f70/src/pages/Experiences.svelte#L44"&gt;Experiences.svelte#44&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#each-slide-or-page-runs-smoothly-to-the-next-one"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  💫 Each slide (or page) runs smoothly to the next one
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a key point to a good experience: it has to be smooth. Any superfluous actions must be avoided and the necessary ones must fit in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user fills a form, a smooth button is displayed to validate the input. So they knows everything is ok and they can go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing to type, it transitions to the next one. No button is needed as the input does not have to be checked. Fill the appreciation form after the typing session and go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to scroll and go further. Thus every slide contains a small amount of information and are reviewed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these thoughts we had are making the experiment, well, smooth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#give-it-a-try"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Give it a try ❤️

      <title>Secure Password Handling in Python</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/martinheinz/secure-password-handling-in-python-3fg1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every application requires some form of authentication, password handling or use of secure credentials such as API keys. You might not be security expert, but you should know how to deal with all these passwords and credentials securely to keep your application users' credentials and data protected as well as your own API keys and various token. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping these security elements safe includes, generating them, verifying them, storing them securely and protecting them from adversaries. So, in this article we will explore Python libraries, tools and concepts that will help as with exactly that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prompting-for-password"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prompting For Password
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start simple - you have basic Python application with command line interface. You need to ask user for password. You could use &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;, but that would show the password in terminal, to avoid that you should use &lt;code&gt;getpass&lt;/code&gt; instead:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getuser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Do Stuff...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpass&lt;/code&gt; is a very simple package that allows you to prompt user for password as well as get their username by extracting current user's login name. Be aware though that not every system supports hiding of passwords. Python will try to warn you about that, so just read warnings in command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generating"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generating
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it might be preferable to generate a password rather than prompt user for one. For example if you want to set initial password that gets changed upon first login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn't any library for generating passwords, but implementing it isn't difficult:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;secrets&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Choose wide set of characters, but consider what your system can handle
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alphabet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ascii_letters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;punctuation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secrets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The passwords generated using above code will be strong, but very hard to remember. If it's just an initial, temporary password or short-lived token then it's fine, but if user should is it for longer, then it's more appropriate to use passphrase instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could build a passphrase generator like we did with simple passwords above, but why bother when there's library available for this. This library is called &lt;code&gt;xkcdpass&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/936/"&gt;famous XKCD&lt;/a&gt; about password strength, and it does exactly what the comic describes - generates strong passphrase made of words:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pip install xkcdpass
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;xkcdpass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xkcd_password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xp&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;word_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;locate_wordfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_wordlist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wordfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;word_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_xkcdpassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;acrostic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"python"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;numwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;delimiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# punch*yesterday*throwback*heaviness*overnight*numbing
# plethora*yesterday*thigh*handlebar*outmost*natural
# pyromania*yearly*twisty*hyphen*overstuff*nuzzle
# pandemic*yearly*theology*hatching*overlaid*neurosis
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This snippet starts by finding a word/dictionary file on your system such as &lt;code&gt;/usr/dict/words&lt;/code&gt; and picks all the words of the specified length, from which it then generates a word list used for generating the passphrase. The generator itself has a few arguments which we can use to customize the passphrase. Apart from obvious ones like number of words and length, it also has &lt;em&gt;acrostic&lt;/em&gt; parameter, which is a word whose characters will be used as first letters of words in the passphrase (sounds complicated? well, see the example passphrases above).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really wanted to build this yourself, instead of adding a dependency to your project, you can use this recipe in &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#recipes-and-best-practices"&gt;Python docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hashing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hashing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we asked user for password or generated it for them, what do we do with it? We might want to store it somewhere in database, but as you probably (hopefully) know, you should never store a password in its plaintext format. Why is that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, passwords should never be stored in a recoverable format, whether plain text or encrypted. They should be hashed using a cryptographically-strong one-way function. This way if someone gets hold of the passwords in database, they will have very hard time recovering any actual passwords, because only way to recover any password from hash is to brute-force it - that is - taking possible plaintext passwords, hashing them with same algorithm and comparing results with the entries in database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the brute-forcing more difficult, additionally &lt;em&gt;salt&lt;/em&gt; should be used. Salt is a random string stored alongside the hashed password. It gets appended to the password before hashing, making it more random and therefore harder to guess (using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table"&gt;rainbow tables&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with modern hardware that can attempt billions of hashes per second, making the password hard to guess isn't enough, therefore &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; hash functions are used for password hashing making it much more inefficient for attacker to brute-force a password. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: the above greatly over-simplifies logic and reasons for using these hash functions. For more thought-out explanation see for example this &lt;a href="https://sqreen.github.io/DevelopersSecurityBestPractices/safe-password-storage/python"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few libraries and individual hashing algorithms out there, but the above requirements narrow our choice down significantly. The go to solution for hashing in Python should be &lt;code&gt;passlib&lt;/code&gt; as it provides proper algorithms, as well as high-level interface usable even by people who aren't well-versed with cryptography.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pip install passlib
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;passlib.hash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;setting_kwds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ('salt', 'rounds', 'ident', 'truncate_error')
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;default_rounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 12
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasher&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Make it slower
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hasher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# $2b$13$H9.qdcodBFCYOWDVMrjx/uT.fbKzYloMYD7Hj2ItDmEOnX5lw.BX.
# \__/\/ \____________________/\_____________________________/
# Alg Rounds  Salt (22 char)            Hash (31 char)
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# True
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"not-the-password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# False
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this snippet we use &lt;code&gt;bcrypt&lt;/code&gt; as our algorithm of choice, as it's one of the most popular and well tested hashing algorithms. First we inspect its possible settings and check what is the default number of rounds used by the algorithm. We then modify the &lt;em&gt;hasher&lt;/em&gt; to use higher number of rounds (cost factor) making the hashing slower and therefore, hashes harder to crack. This number should be the largest possible that doesn't cause intolerable delay for your users (~300ms). &lt;code&gt;passlib&lt;/code&gt; updates default rounds value periodically, so your don't necessarily need to change this value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hasher ready we prompt user for password and hash it. At this point we could store it in database, here for demonstration purposes, we go ahead and verify it against original plaintext password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above code, we can see that whole usage of &lt;code&gt;passlib&lt;/code&gt; boils down to &lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;modify&lt;/code&gt; methods of our algorithm of choice. If you however wanted more control over schemes, rounds, etc., then you can use &lt;code&gt;CryptContext&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;passlib.context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CryptContext&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CryptContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;schemes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bcrypt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"argon2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"scrypt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"bcrypt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;span class="n"&gt;bcrypt__rounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getpass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# $2b$14$pFTXqnHjn91C8k8ehbuM.uSJM.H5S0l7vkxE8NxgAiS2LiMWMziAe
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"not-the-password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hashed_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This context object allows us to work with multiple schemes, setting defaults or configuring cost factors. If your application authentication is simple, then this is probably not necessary, but in case you require ability to use multiple hashing algorithms, deprecate them, re-hash hashes or similar advanced tasks, then you might want to look into full &lt;code&gt;CryptContext&lt;/code&gt; integration &lt;a href="https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/narr/context-tutorial.html"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why might you want to use &lt;code&gt;CryptContext&lt;/code&gt; is if you need to deal with operating system passwords such as the ones in &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt;. For that you can use preconfigured contexts available in &lt;code&gt;passlib.hosts&lt;/code&gt;, for more details see example &lt;a href="https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lib/passlib.hosts.html#current-host-os"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For completeness let me also list a couple other libraries available, including their (different) use-cases: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt"&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; is a library and algorithm which we used above. This is the same code which is used by &lt;code&gt;passlib&lt;/code&gt; and there's not really a reason to use this low-level library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypt.html"&gt;crypt&lt;/a&gt; is a Python standard library module that provides functions that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be used for password hashing. The algorithms provided are however dependent on your system, and the ones listed in docs aren't as strong as the ones shown above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html"&gt;hashlib&lt;/a&gt; is another builtin module. This one however includes strong hashing functions suitable for password hashing. Interface of this library makes the functions more customizable and therefore requires a bit more knowledge to use properly (securely). You could absolutely use functions from this module, such as &lt;code&gt;hashlib.scrypt&lt;/code&gt; for hashing your passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html"&gt;hmac&lt;/a&gt;, the last hashing module Python standard library has to offer is just not suitable for password hashing. HMAC is used to verify integrity and authenticity of message and doesn't have the properties required for password hashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little side-note: With all the newly acquired knowledge about proper ways to store passwords, let's imagine that you forgot your password to some service. You click on &lt;em&gt;"Forgot password?"&lt;/em&gt; on the website and instead of a recovery link, they send you your actual password. That means that they store your password in plaintext, and it also means that you should run away from that service (and if you used same password in other places, then change it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#storing-securely"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Storing Securely
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section we assumed that the intention was to store other users' credentials, but what about your own passwords that you're using to login into remote systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving passwords in code is obviously terrible choice, as it's lying there in plaintext for anyone to see and you're also running risk of accidentally pushing it to git repo. A little better option would be to store it in environment variables. You can create &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file, add it to &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;, populate it with credentials needed for current project. You can then use &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt; package to get all these variables into your application like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pip install python-dotenv
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os.path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;load_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dotenv_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__file__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;".env"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;load_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dotenv_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;API_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"API_KEY"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"default"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# a3491fb2-000f-4d9f-943e-127cfe29c39c
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This snippet first builds path to the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file using &lt;code&gt;os.path&lt;/code&gt; functions, which is then used to load the environment variables using &lt;code&gt;load_dotenv()&lt;/code&gt;. If your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file is in current directory like in the example above, then you can simplify the code and just call &lt;code&gt;load_dotenv(find_dotenv())&lt;/code&gt; which automatically finds the environment file. When the file is loaded, all that's left is to retrieve individual variables using &lt;code&gt;os.environ.get&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you don't want to pollute your environment with application variables and secrets you can load them directly like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dotenv_values&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dotenv_values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;".env"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# OrderedDict([('API_KEY', 'a3491fb2-000f-4d9f-943e-127cfe29c39c')])
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above solution is fine, but we can do better. Instead of storing passwords in unprotected file, we can instead use system's &lt;em&gt;keyring&lt;/em&gt;, which is an application that can store secure credentials in encrypted file in your home directory. This file by default uses your user account login password for encryption, so it gets automatically unlocked when you login and you therefore don't have worry about extra password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use keyring credentials in Python applications, we can use library called &lt;code&gt;keyring&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pip install keyring
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;keyring&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;keyring.util.platform_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keyring_platform&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keyring_platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config_root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# /home/username/.config/python_keyring  # Might be different for you
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keyring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_keyring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring (priority: 5)
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"my-app"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ENTRY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"API_KEY"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;keyring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENTRY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"a3491fb2-000f-4d9f-943e-127cfe29c39c"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keyring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENTRY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# a3491fb2-000f-4d9f-943e-127cfe29c39c
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;cred&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keyring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_credential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ENTRY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Password for username &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; in namespace &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Password for username API_KEY in namespace my-app is a3491fb2-000f-4d9f-943e-127cfe29c39c
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code, we start by checking location of keyring config file, which is the place where you can make some configuration adjustments if needed. We then check the active keyring and proceed with adding a password into it. Each entry has 3 attributes - &lt;em&gt;service&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;, where service acts as a namespace, which in this case would be a name of an application. To create and retrieve an entry, we can just use &lt;code&gt;set_password&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get_password&lt;/code&gt; respectively. In addition to that, also &lt;code&gt;get_credential&lt;/code&gt; can be used - it returns a &lt;em&gt;credential&lt;/em&gt; object which has an attribute for username and password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not security specialist, you're still responsible for basic security features of applications you build. This includes taking good care of users' data and especially passwords, so hopefully some of these examples and recipes will help you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the approaches and techniques shown in this article, the best way to handle passwords is to avoid using them altogether by delegating the authentication to OIDC provider (e.g. Google or GitHub) or by replacing them with key-based authentication and encryption, which we will dive into in the next article.&lt;/p&gt;

  Creational Design Pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/gauravratnawat/builder-pattern-2pk2"&gt;Builder Pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to use
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid dealing with inconsistent object when the object needs to be created over several steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid too many constructor arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To construct an object that should be immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To encapsulate the complete creation logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intent"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intent
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Components
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Builder class specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ConcreteBuilder constructs and puts together parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface. It defines and keeps track of the representation it creates and provides an interface for saving the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Director class constructs the complex object using the Builder interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Product represents the complex object that is being built.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SjAv4G4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1bjply6jkt7f3sssw3du.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SjAv4G4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1bjply6jkt7f3sssw3du.png" alt="Builder Pattern"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Define the Product (House) that gets assembled in the builder pattern.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.gaurav.builder;

/* The house is the object that gets assembled in the builder pattern. */
public class House {

  private String floorType;
  private String wallType;
  private String roofType;

  public String getFloorType() {
    return floorType;
  }

  public void setFloorType(String floorType) {
    this.floorType = floorType;
  }

  public String getWallType() {
    return wallType;
  }

  public void setWallType(String wallType) {
    this.wallType = wallType;
  }

  public String getRoofType() {
    return roofType;
  }

  public void setRoofType(String roofType) {
    this.roofType = roofType;
  }

  public String toString() {
    return new String("\nConstructing House \n FloorType: " + floorType
        + "\n WallType:  " + wallType + "\n RoofType:  " + roofType );
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2 Define the Builder interface (or abstract class) along with Concrete Builders. The Builder interface contains methods for the step by step construction of the product. It also has a build method for retrieving the product object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.gaurav.builder;

public interface HouseBuilder {

  public HouseBuilder buildFloor();
  public HouseBuilder buildWall();
  public HouseBuilder buildRoof();
  public House build();

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3 Concrete Builders implement the Builder interface. A Concrete Builder is responsible for creating and assembling a Product object. Different Concrete Builders create and assemble Product objects differently.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.gaurav.builder;

public class ConcreteHouseBuilder implements HouseBuilder {

  private House house;

  public ConcreteHouseBuilder() {
    house = new House();
  }

  public HouseBuilder buildFloor() {
    house.setFloorType("concrete");
    return this;
  }

  public HouseBuilder buildWall() {
    house.setWallType("concrete");
    return this;
  }

  public HouseBuilder buildRoof() {
    house.setRoofType("concrete");
    return this;
  }

  public House build() {
    return house;
  }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
package com.gaurav.builder;

public class WoodenHouseBuilder implements HouseBuilder {

  private House house;

  public WoodenHouseBuilder() {
    house = new House();
  }

  public HouseBuilder buildFloor() {
    house.setFloorType("wood");
    return this;
  }

  public HouseBuilder buildWall() {
    house.setWallType("wood");
    return this;
  }

  public HouseBuilder buildRoof() {
    house.setRoofType("wood");
    return this;
  }

  public House build() {
    return house;
  }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 A Director object is responsible for constructing a Product. It does this via the Builder interface to a Concrete Builder. It constructs a Product via the various Builder methods. The director class ensures that all the required operations are performed before the object is returned to the client in a 'consistent' state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.gaurav.builder;

public class HouseBuildDirector {
  private HouseBuilder builder;

  public HouseBuildDirector(final HouseBuilder builder) {
    this.builder = builder;
  }

  public House construct() {
    /* call the necessary methods and return the consistent object*/
    return builder.buildFloor().buildWall().buildRoof().build();
  }

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5 The client code. The Client uses different builder objects to create different types of products. However, the construction process is same.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package com.gaurav.client;

import com.gaurav.builder.ConcreteHouseBuilder;
import com.gaurav.builder.HouseBuildDirector;
import com.gaurav.builder.HouseBuilder;
import com.gaurav.builder.WoodenHouseBuilder;

public class BuilderClient {

  public static void main(final String[] arguments) {

    /* Construct a concrete house */
    HouseBuilder builder = new ConcreteHouseBuilder();
    HouseBuildDirector carBuildDirector = new HouseBuildDirector(builder);
    System.out.println(carBuildDirector.construct());

    /* Construct a wooden house */
    builder = new WoodenHouseBuilder();
    carBuildDirector = new HouseBuildDirector(builder);
    System.out.println(carBuildDirector.construct());
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Output
Constructing House 
 FloorType: concrete
 WallType:  concrete
 RoofType:  concrete

      <title>Supersets and their humble beginnings</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;   "As we all know, each language has its own vocabulary. Words in English are not the same as words in French. It is the job of a dictionary to convert words from one language to another. How does the dictionary know which language we are using and convert words to the correct language?"                                     Raymond Chen, Microsoft Developer, creator of The Old New Thing
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming languages, much like spoken languages, have developed from the most basic forms of communication (machine code) to flexible, specialized, and succinct tools (C++, C#, Swift). An early programming language such as Assembly, could be (loosely) compared to the spoken language of Latin. While Latin is still taught in some university applications and isnt nearly as long winded as machine code, our conversations are held in region-defined inflective languages. (Old English vs Modern English)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take a moment to explain what I mean by 'inflective' language - if I were to call someone a 'Joey', that would provide the assumption that you know what I mean. However, if you don't get the reference, then I need to explain who Joey is, and the source material of who he is. This sort of explicit explanation creates a longer conversation, and allows more room for misunderstanding in the joke. By using inflective language, you are able to use a context-specific shorthand to give additional meaning to a singular word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c8glBTIo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mwx95rfi54cmq64j0pne.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c8glBTIo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mwx95rfi54cmq64j0pne.jpg" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example I'll bring here today will be a comparison of machine code to assembly code. Douglas Hofstadter, Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at Indiana University once said that 'looking at a program written in machine language is vaguely comparable to looking at a DNA molecule, atom by atom.' To make this comparison clear in our programming, machine language is a low-level language that can be read by the CPU directly, meaning that we are directly accessing the instruction set of the CPU architecture. This code is nigh-unreadable, and boils down to punching 1's and 0's into the terminal. While it can be run without the need for translation, writing it is time-intensive and highly prone to errors. Machine code can roughly be equated to using punch cards to write your program. Pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lYWvbMrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dje5ahofrtbrl63lne8a.JPG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lYWvbMrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dje5ahofrtbrl63lne8a.JPG" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extension, or super set of machine code, would be an assembly language. While also a low-level language, it provided the human-readable key of...well, keywords. Keywords provide a shorthand alternative to explicit implementation, and provides better methods for writing and debugging. It takes less time to use these keywords to get the desired result, allowing for faster development times. The really cool thing about both of these forms of programming language, is that they're written to directly interface with the CPU architecture through the designed instruction set of the processor family - meaning that you can write assembly code, or write in machine code, and still usually get the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CBT8x22E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bng3jrdz8o74gm928ufh.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CBT8x22E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bng3jrdz8o74gm928ufh.jpg" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern(ish) equivalent of this comparison, is the superset language. Superset languages provide all the features of a given language, and give expanded and enhanced functionality over their subset counterparts. For example, the C programming language provided an understanding of data-types and structures over its predecessor, B. It supported dynamic memory allocation, allowing for more efficient use of what memory was available to computers in 1972. However, C was not capable of data encapsulation, nor did it have any native methods for direct exception handling - bug management had to be implemented by hand. C's superset, C++, developed in 1985, provided this missing functionality natively, and expanded C's capability by providing direct exception handling, classes, inheritance, polymorphism (the ability to behave in multiple forms) and data-encapsulation, a key element in object-oriented programming. The additional benefit to using C++, is that it is syntactically similar to C, meaning that conversion of your software from one language to another isn't as monumentally huge of a task, in comparison to rewriting your 1's and 0's to assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a simple takeaway can be given, it might be that while languages do change, our current state of programming languages provide a level of flexibility in writing and maintaining our code, giving us the ability to allow our inflective language come out, and bring new levels of capability to our work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started with Appwrite's Apple SDK and SwiftUI</title>
      <author>Christy Jacob</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 18:21:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appwrite/getting-started-with-appwrites-apple-sdk-and-swiftui-131h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/getting-started-with-appwrites-apple-sdk-and-swiftui-131h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the major highlights of Appwrite 0.11 is the official support for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. We've also released a brand-new Apple SDK to go alongside it! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---e2V5P2W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z57is2vh5f81zomtmhpe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---e2V5P2W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z57is2vh5f81zomtmhpe.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll learn to set up Appwrite's Apple SDK, interact with Appwrite's Accounts API and also learn to set up OAuth Logins in your App. Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll use &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/"&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/a&gt; in this tutorial, if you're using UIKit, check out &lt;a href=""&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📝 Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, we assume that you already have an Appwrite instance up and running. If you do not have Appwrite setup yet, you can follow the super easy installation &lt;strong&gt;step&lt;/strong&gt; over at &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/installation"&gt;appwrite.io&lt;/a&gt;. It's not a typo. There really is only 1 step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have also set up an OAuth provider with Appwrite to be able to follow the OAuth section of this tutorial. You can learn to set up OAuth providers in Appwrite with &lt;a href="https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-oauth-providers-3jf6"&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-new-app-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🛠️ Create a new App Project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new &lt;strong&gt;Multiplatform &amp;gt; App&lt;/strong&gt; in Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yA2kyMZ8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bccme991eygpapfa11ww.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yA2kyMZ8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bccme991eygpapfa11ww.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the app created, now is also a good time to add our iOS, macOS, watchOS or tvOS app as a platform in the Appwrite Console. Head over to your project file and find your &lt;strong&gt;Bundle Identifier&lt;/strong&gt;. It should look something like &lt;code&gt;io.appwrite.Appwrite-iOS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your Appwrite console, click on &lt;strong&gt;Add Platform&lt;/strong&gt; and select a &lt;strong&gt;New Apple App&lt;/strong&gt;, then one of the iOS, macOS, watchOS or tvOS tabs. Give your app a name, add the bundle identifier and click &lt;strong&gt;Register&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is complete, it's time to head back to our Xcode project and add our dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-appwrites-apple-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👷 Setup Appwrite's Apple SDK
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-xcode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Xcode
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Appwrite Apple SDK is available via Swift Package Manager. In order to use the Appwrite Apple SDK from &lt;strong&gt;Xcode&lt;/strong&gt;, select File &amp;gt; Swift Packages &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Add Package Dependency&lt;/strong&gt;. In the dialog that appears, enter the Appwrite Apple SDK &lt;a href="https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-apple"&gt;package URL&lt;/a&gt; and click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the repository information is loaded, add your version rules and click &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DiML_Mn9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ngnb4wjvojs8ya6qpccg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DiML_Mn9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ngnb4wjvojs8ya6qpccg.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final screen, make sure &lt;code&gt;Appwrite&lt;/code&gt; is selected to add to your target as a library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lr5axdVz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kr3up1r47b7hcqjoddpf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lr5axdVz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kr3up1r47b7hcqjoddpf.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-swift-package-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Swift Package Manager
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the package to your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt; dependencies:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-apple"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"0.1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then add it to your target:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;targets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"[YourAppTarget]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Appwrite"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"sdk-for-apple"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Build your project and if there are no errors, we're ready to proceed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-the-layouts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏗️ Create the layouts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file &lt;code&gt;AccountView.swift&lt;/code&gt; and add the following. This defines our SwiftUI view and sets up our buttons and their click listeners that will call the &lt;code&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://localhost:80/v1"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;projectId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"613b18dabf74a"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;projectId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setSelfSigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AccountView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@ObservedObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ViewModel&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;VStack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;downloadedImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;resizable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;aspectRatio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;contentMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;frame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;TextEditor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Login with Facebook"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We'll add this later&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;registerOAuthHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ExampleView_Previews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;PreviewProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔨 Create the ViewModel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now create a ViewModel &lt;code&gt;AccountViewModel.swift&lt;/code&gt; to manage state and interact with the Appwrite SDK in response to UI interactions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Foundation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AccountView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ObservableObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"test@test.test"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;createSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;DispatchQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;logOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;deleteSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;sessionId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"current"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;describing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;DispatchQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our ViewModel has 4 state objects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have 4 functions to interact with the Appwrite SDK:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;register - onClick handler for the Signup Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;login - onClick handler for the Login Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logout - onClick handler for the Logout Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getUser - onClick handler for the Get User Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-the-application-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔧 Update The Application File
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let's update our &lt;code&gt;AccountApp.swift&lt;/code&gt;, which will initialise our application and create the &lt;code&gt;AccountView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AccountViewModel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;@main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AccountApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;WindowGroup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AccountView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AccountView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;ViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to run your app and create users, login, logout and get information about the currently logged-in user!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-oauth-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔐 Adding OAuth Support
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would have noticed that we have a &lt;strong&gt;Login With Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; button in our UI, but it doesn't do anything yet; let's now add Facebook OAuth to our app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to add a callback URL scheme to our &lt;code&gt;Info.plist&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;CFBundleTypeRole&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Editor&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;io.appwrite&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;appwrite-callback-[PROJECT-ID]&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure you replace the Project ID in &lt;code&gt;appwrite-callback-[PROJECT-ID]&lt;/code&gt; with your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we'll add a function to our ViewModel to call the &lt;code&gt;createOAuth2Session()&lt;/code&gt; method of the Appwrite SDK.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;loginWithFacebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;createOAuth2Session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"facebook"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/auth/oauth2/success"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/auth/oauth2/failure"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"false"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last step is to invoke this function from &lt;code&gt;AccountView.swift&lt;/code&gt;, calling the function from our existing button's action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Login with Facebook"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;loginWithFacebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Re-run your app and you should now be able to trigger your Facebook OAuth Flow! With that, you now know how to interact with Appwrite's Accounts API in your iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've built a complete app that interacts with all of Appwrite's APIs, which you can find over at our &lt;a href="https://github.com/appwrite/playground-for-apple-swiftui"&gt;Github Repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you'd like to learn more about Appwrite or how Appwrite works under the hood, we've just curated all the resources for you during &lt;a href="https://30days.appwrite.io/"&gt;30 Days of Appwrite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Second Time Experience and Learnings @Hacktoberfest | How to Contribute</title>
      <author>Anamika</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/noviicee/my-second-time-experince-and-learnings-hactoberfest-how-to-contribute-4k63</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/noviicee/my-second-time-experince-and-learnings-hactoberfest-how-to-contribute-4k63</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy all! Hope the winds of October are flowing with you and you all are doing great. 🍁&lt;br&gt;
The second-most famous thing about October, apart from Halloween is &lt;em&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/em&gt; 🎉&lt;br&gt;
Yes, its that time of the year when Open Source enthusiasts and developers from all around the globe, come together and contribute to various open source projects. These projects may range from being a beginner-level to solving some of real-time problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, was my second time @Hactoberfest, and needless to say, I got to learn a lot of things, just like the previous year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you wish to see what all I got to learn previous year, from this month-long journey of contributing to open source, you can read my article, which I have shared over &lt;a href="https://dev.to/noviicee/experience-of-my-first-ever-hactoberfest-2b62"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I still remember the day last year. It was 15th of October when I made 4 valid PRs, and was waiting for them to get matured (14-days time period). I shared my experience of my &lt;em&gt;first-ever Hacktoberfest&lt;/em&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am here to share my second time experience about Hactoberfest, what all did I learn, how this year was different than the previous one, and how can YOU contribute! Believe me, it's never too late. Register yourself now, and get started. &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since participating in the fest last year, I was determined that I will be participating next year as well. This year, I was waiting eagerly for the season to begin. I registered myself as soon as the initial registrations got opened. After that, I was waiting for October to start!&lt;br&gt;
One thing, about which I was very firm was to make real, &lt;em&gt;valuable&lt;/em&gt; contributions. Similar to last year, my focus wasn't on getting the T-Shirt, but to move ahead in my open source journey and to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October came and I started off! After registering for the Hacktoberfest, you will come across a demo on the official page, which is made for beginners in open source, in order to help them with Version-Control System.&lt;br&gt;
Previous year when I was starting off, I did not even know a single line about open source and version-controlling. I was struggling to even clone a github repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward one year-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reachtoana/status/1443642967575564314"&gt;See full tweet Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Added my Haiku 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it's not a huge thing, but the feeling of being unable to do it an year ago, to be able to do it with ease is overwhelming. I just feel happy that I was able to expand my learning even if it was by just a small percentage.&lt;br&gt;
Wholeheartedly thankful to @hacktoberfest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1RRHWZBE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qvlnyapkxdytk1qrb5kb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1RRHWZBE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qvlnyapkxdytk1qrb5kb.png" alt="Hacktoberfest-Congratulations"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contributions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, my major contributions were code contributions. My first contribution, was a simple code contribution in  a repository which was especially designed for beginners in order to start their journey with open source. I made some documentation contributions as well, but they were marked &lt;em&gt;invalid&lt;/em&gt; after a few days (maybe because rules were updated in the middle of the month last year). Yeah, 3 of my 4 PRs were code contributions, and one was a tiny fix of a link. 😄&lt;br&gt;
I  was able to make 4 PRs till October 15th and only after that I realized that I will have to wait for them to get matured (14 days time-period) 💦&lt;br&gt;
Well, all my PRs got accepted and I received my first Open Source gift in the month of February 2021 (it took some time to reach my place due to pandemic conditions all around)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-this-year-was-different"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How this year was different
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very clear that this year, I won't make just simple code contributions. Since I have been into open source for quite some time, I wanted to make valuable contributions. So I started searching for issues that would actually help projects. My favorite programming language is Python, so I was searching for projects that involved Python. I found some really  amazing ones which required contributors and I began working on them. I set up the project on my machine, ran everything, checked upon all the functionalities and raised issues wherever I thought some changes were needed. Apart from these, I also worked on projects which involved a dash of front-end development. Reason being that I have learnt a little bit about front-end development, and I wanted to implement my learnings into real-time projects.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is one such benefit of contributing to open source. To learn and implement at the same time.&lt;/em&gt; 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing that I was looking forward to was- &lt;em&gt;do not contribute only for the sake of completing 4 PRs in Hacktoberfest and then forget everything&lt;/em&gt; 😂&lt;br&gt;
My first purpose was to witness an increment in my learning curve. As I said, I wanted to try hands-on front-end, I found a really fun project that even &lt;strong&gt;beginners can contribute to!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can follow it &lt;a href="https://github.com/TerabyteTiger/color-themes"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Basically I saw &lt;a href="#"&gt;this  post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/thepracticaldev"&gt;@thepracticaldev&lt;/a&gt;
 and was really interested to try a theme!&lt;br&gt;
You can also contribute if you want to 💛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, I made some contributions in the form of resources. I believe that having resources at one place proves to be really helpful for everyone who is learning and so I wanted to provide my contributions in the form of PRs to such repositories which collects and organizes all resources at one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y7P1c0na--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2200kr95okdo5wxgyodr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y7P1c0na--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2200kr95okdo5wxgyodr.png" alt="Hacktoberfest-Anamika-S-Profile-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rounding-off"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rounding Off
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are halfway through the 8th edition of Hacktoberfest, and it has been an amazing experience till now. From struggling to make a single Pull Request last year, to completing Hacktoberfest Challenge easily this year makes me happy. It lights a spark inside that yes, at least I was able to learn &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; in a span of one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it was Hacktoberfest which introduced me to the Dev Community, and I feel really glad to be a part of this community since a year. I have also recived the One-Year Badge on 15th of October 2021 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Nq7s3mL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nodmbf3vwcy41o5aoqk2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Nq7s3mL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nodmbf3vwcy41o5aoqk2.png" alt="One-Year-On-Dev.To"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the Beginners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don't feel intimidated. There are lots of issues that you can start working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out for any sort of discussion regarding the post, or other materials. If you wish to connect with me, you can find me &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anamika-singh-0fficial/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; also, apart from my Dev.to profile of course 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, I wish &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Hacktober&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to everyone 🍈&lt;br&gt;
May the source be with you. 💫&lt;/p&gt;
