      <guid>https://dev.to/primerlabs/a-guide-to-getting-out-of-a-rut-when-you-are-working-alone-44l7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while, I had been in a rut. If you don't know what rut means, here is the dictionary definition for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a habit or pattern of behavior that has become dull and unproductive but is hard to change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working alone on a project for so long, and the rest of my life took a hit. I didn't enjoy anything else. I would bail out when my friends call. I didn't like the foods I used to like earlier, and I didn't feel like doing anything for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, even my passion project,  &lt;a href="https://primerlabs.io"&gt;Primer&lt;/a&gt; , seemed a bit too much for me. I didn't enjoy working on it anymore. Seemed like another "job" to me. That's when I knew I was in a rut. Something needed to change. The following is what I did to recover from the rut and I am writing this guide in the hopes that it will help you get out of it too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the tl;dr version&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find what you love and schedule it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure your productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to sleep at the same time and try to wake up at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise  (Show up at the gym, everyday)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make plans with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan a vacation that you look forward to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen to classical music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write Night Reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-what-you-love-and-schedule-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find What you love and schedule it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a keyboard, a guitar, and a ukelele and have never got around to actually learning any of them. The first thing I did to get out of the rut was to pick up a hobby. My hobby always had been programming and reading about the latest computer science advancement. While other people browsed too much Facebook or Instagram, I found myself checking out Hacker News or Less Wrong, sometimes multiple times a day.  I am also a movie buff, so I would look out for Screenplay breakdowns often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided it's time to change hobbies now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning the uke and surprisingly it's fun. Maybe next year, I will graduate to learning guitar as well. For now, the ukulele is a good thing to learn. The best thing about the ukulele is that you start seeing progress soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start getting good at something, you start enjoying it more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I read this in the book,  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/95708.The_Now_Habit"&gt;The Now Habit&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends making room for play in your schedule. I scheduled one hour daily for uke and have been enjoying it for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find what you love and let it kill you schedule it in your calendar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ImxL3lXe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635692740664/gGUb2D3Qz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ImxL3lXe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635692740664/gGUb2D3Qz.png" alt="image (2).png" width="880" height="722"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#measure-your-productivity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Measure your productivity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing to get out of the rut is to measure your productivity. I work in terms of Pomodoro. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Pomodoro = 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my calendar, you can see I have three Deep work sessions. In which I target to do roughly 15 pomodoros. Each day is different and getting yourself to work is one of the most difficult things to do.  And it never gets easier either. But, it is a good system to have.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P2tL5YAC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635692784810/Q_INkFIlZ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P2tL5YAC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635692784810/Q_INkFIlZ.png" alt="image-2.png" width="426" height="385"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another metric I have is words written. My work at  &lt;a href="https://primerlabs.io"&gt;Primerlabs&lt;/a&gt; \is mostly writing self-paced computer science courses. The platform is developed and I am not keen to code much features anymore. So, I track how many words I have written. I write using  &lt;a href="https://typora.io"&gt;Typora&lt;/a&gt; , without the internet. It helps me focus. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="ltag__twitter-tweet"&gt;

  &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__main"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__header"&gt;
      &lt;img class="ltag__twitter-tweet__profile-image" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gcrZ40-i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1111657547558080512/AZgXDvFx_normal.jpg" alt="Siddharth Kanungo (primerlabs.io) profile image"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__full-name"&gt;
        Siddharth Kanungo (primerlabs.io)
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__username"&gt;
        @_wzard
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__twitter-logo"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ir1kO05j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/twitter-f95605061196010f91e64806688390eb1a4dbc9e913682e043eb8b1e06ca484f.svg" alt="twitter logo"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__body"&gt;
      I have used Evernote, Workflowy, Roam, Obsidian, and Mem as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when I write, (which is most of the time nowadays), I use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Typora"&gt;@Typora&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Typora is delightful and simple.
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__date"&gt;
      14:12 PM - 26 Sep 2021
    &lt;/div&gt;


    &lt;div class="ltag__twitter-tweet__actions"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=1442130011062816773" class="ltag__twitter-tweet__actions__button"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fFnoeFxk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/twitter-reply-action-238fe0a37991706a6880ed13941c3efd6b371e4aefe288fe8e0db85250708bc4.svg" alt="Twitter reply action"&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=1442130011062816773" class="ltag__twitter-tweet__actions__button"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k6dcrOn8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/twitter-retweet-action-632c83532a4e7de573c5c08dbb090ee18b348b13e2793175fea914827bc42046.svg" alt="Twitter retweet action"&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/like?tweet_id=1442130011062816773" class="ltag__twitter-tweet__actions__button"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SRQc9lOp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/twitter-like-action-1ea89f4b87c7d37465b0eb78d51fcb7fe6c03a089805d7ea014ba71365be5171.svg" alt="Twitter like action"&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I rewrite a lot because of my perfectionism. My perfectionism also took me three years to build the course platform. So, that's also something I am dealing with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to keep it simple with just two metrics. It's a less number to keep track of. There are other few columns in the excel sheets: &lt;strong&gt;note/reason for not meeting the targets&lt;/strong&gt;, which I have hidden. Because frankly, it's embarrassing.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep few metric and log them religiously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, use work mode/ DND mode on your phone to help you focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#go-to-sleep-at-the-same-time-and-try-to-wake-up-at-the-same-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Go to sleep at the same time and try to wake up at the same time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress the importance of this enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to sleep at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I go to bed at 10 and my wind-down begins at 9:30. That's when I put on my headphones and do my Night review, which I will discuss later in the post. I also have a premium "meditation" app subscription. I won't name it, because I am not happy with it. But it is really easy to guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wind down is a feature in iPhone and it has useful automation built-in. Whenever the wind-down begins, it automatically prompts me to do a few actions, such as reminding me to close my laptop, dim the lights, start winding down on the "meditation" app and start night review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting 8 hours is difficult for me as I have difficulty sleeping. But I consistently try to go to bed at 10 PM nonetheless. Overall, I am finding it easier to sleep frequently than before and my mood is better the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up early is difficult, but I have days when I woke up without an alarm. So, I am definitely making progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exercise-show-up-at-the-gym-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exercise ( Show up at the Gym )
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise has helped me a lot to get out of the rut. I got a yearly membership at a cheaper price at a local gym and my goal has been to show up at the gym. Moving my goal from doing exercises ( which my trainer kind of forces to me go on hard mode ), I try this mini-goal of showing up in the gym. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I think, I can always just run on the treadmill and cycle and then bail out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after a run, I automatically feel to work out. So, if you are just starting out, I recommend, making a goal to just show up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just show up at the gym everyday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#make-plans-with-friends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Make plans with friends
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are in a rut, it's natural for introverts to avoid people like plague (or pandemic).  But making plans with friends is a good way to destress for people who usually work alone ( digital nomads, freelancers, solo founders, etc). It's easy to become self-centered and keep on postponing your social debt to your friends. However, what many people forget is that it's a debt that you must pay for your own sanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pandemic made me realize that I don't really like to be alone. And it's really awkward when you are in need and you want to suddenly ask for favors from friends out of blue. So, make plans, even if all your friends are lazy ass introverts. Take initiatives and make plans. It is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things, online gaming does is help reconnect with friends. I have been playing chess with friends more often. And sometimes, call of duty on mobile as well. It's a great way to spend time with friends with whom you cannot meet directly due to distance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plan-a-vacation-that-you-look-forward-to"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plan a vacation that you look forward to
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are working alone, you might wait for the next big goal to hit, when you will finally enjoy some time off. At least, it was for me, I would think, I cannot take a vacation until I get &lt;strong&gt;XYZ&lt;/strong&gt; done. But when you plan a vacation and book your tickets ( which are at a low cost ), you can plan for months ahead. Your targets are well-defined in the time frame. I have had difficulty planning and organizing my life, because of the mess of working alone. But planning a vacation helps a lot in helping you prioritize what you actually need to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, your vacation is four months from now, you can make a list of things you need to in four months. And then work your way backward, for monthly goals and weekly goals and stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan a vacation and backtrack your work schedule&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#listen-to-classical-music"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Listen to classical music
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not work for everyone, but I listen to classical music while I work. I used to be a fan of lo-fi and trance music combined with famous OSTs from Interstellar, Social Network, etc. But I now listen mostly to classical music. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read that classical music helps in focusing, but for me, I have really started appreciating the music. It also helps when you learn a bit about classical music. I can highly recommend  &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introclassicalmusic"&gt;this course&lt;/a&gt;  from Coursera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listen to a mix of western and Indian classical music. I listen to Indian Classical music at   &lt;a href="https://www.ragya.com/"&gt;Ragya&lt;/a&gt;  which is plays music depending on the time of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#write-night-reviews"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Write Night Reviews
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing night reviews consist of the following things for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going through what I did throughout the day and what I could have done better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging my metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan for the next day and some targets to meet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write what you are grateful for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing night reviews has been a great way to let go of the worries of the day and prepare for the next day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review your day, daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing Note
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my second month, doing this and I already feel that I am out of the rut. You will start seeing good changes in your mood in two weeks or so. So, stick to that. If you found this write-up useful, you can connect with me on  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_wzard"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; . And if you are interested to know what I am working on, you can check out this  &lt;a href="https://primerlabs.io/comics/introducing-primer-comics/"&gt;comic-based blog&lt;/a&gt;  post to understand more. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Again, I forgot to publish this yesterday, when the word was "Contrast." I did two drawings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was a basic "logo" showing the word "contrast" with the contrast symbol (kind of):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/embed/MWvvMpy?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one was an animated drawing showing the contrast between the summer and winter season on the same landscape (slide right and left to see the changes):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/embed/VwzMvzx?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this last one won't work for Firefox users, who will only see the static winter landscape and won't be able to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>✉️Application for collecting data from the Telegram (part 2: Chat participants)👾</title>

      <link>https://dev.to/vadimkolobanov/application-for-collecting-data-from-the-telegram-part-2-chat-participants-3b7e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vadimkolobanov/application-for-collecting-data-from-the-telegram-part-2-chat-participants-3b7e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone In the second part, we will continue to collect chat data from the "secure and twice encrypted" Telegram server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reading the article, I strongly recommend &lt;a href="https://dev.to/vadimkolobanov/telegram-parsing-part-1-setup-and-first-launch-1j2m"&gt;reading the first part&lt;/a&gt;. In it, we created a Telegram developer account and set up our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our project is just one ".py" file, settings and session file.&lt;br&gt;
As one well- known wisdom says:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we will make a beautiful strong project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, we will get a list of users from the telegram chat and see, what information about its participants telegram will give us if we are not the chat administrator, but went there as a regular user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#go-to-pycharm-my-friends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Go to PyCharm my friends
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order not to get confused in our code in the future, we will create several files in the project directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users.py&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;links.txt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will write all our code in this chapter in a separate file Users.py . This will greatly simplify our work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's import this file into our main project, which we wrote in the first part (&lt;em&gt;At the end of the article I will post the code from both parts so don't worry&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, for further work with chat users, we will need a couple more imports from our Telethon library.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telethon.tl.functions.channels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telethon.tl.types&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For clarity and convenience, let's install the &lt;strong&gt;tqdm&lt;/strong&gt; library in our project. It will allow us to create in our console a beautiful readable Progress Bar ( a graphical strip of the progress of our unloading )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the &lt;strong&gt;pip install tqdm&lt;/strong&gt; command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importing the library class into our project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All imports in main file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;configparser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telethon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TelegramClient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telethon.tl.functions.channels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;telethon.tl.types&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We still have a file that we don't understand &lt;strong&gt;links.txt&lt;/strong&gt; , which you and I will use as a list of our links to chats from which we will parse data, but we will talk about this a little further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our file Users.py let's create an async function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dump_all_participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;channel&lt;/strong&gt;— this will be our telegram chat which we will pass to our function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/strong&gt; are our imports that we did above, they are the same classes of the Telethon library that we will need in our function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tqdm&lt;/strong&gt; is our library for progress bar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt; is our connection that we created in the first part. No way without it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's set up reading chat links from our file links.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our main file &lt;strong&gt;Update.py&lt;/strong&gt; inside the main function from the last part, we will write this code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"links.txt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"r"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;readline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dump_all_participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                                  &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, immediately after reading the file, we will call our &lt;strong&gt;dump_all_participants&lt;/strong&gt; function from the file Users.py by passing our arguments to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the file &lt;strong&gt;Users.py&lt;/strong&gt; where we created our &lt;strong&gt;dump_all_participants&lt;/strong&gt; function and we will write the initial settings for the Telethon library.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dump_all_participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Get info from channel'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;OFFSET_USER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#start user position
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;LIMIT_USER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#the maximum number of records transmitted 
&lt;/span&gt;                      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#at a time, but not more than 200
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ALL_PARTICIPANTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;FILTER_USER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ChannelParticipantsSearch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#filter user
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's create an infinite while loop:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within our cycle, the magic itself begins.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;participants&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetParticipantsRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
               &lt;span class="n"&gt;FILTER_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;OFFSET_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LIMIT_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ALL_PARTICIPANTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;OFFSET_USER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;participants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We turned to telegram, and with the help of its class and our constants, we sent a request to get a list of users of the chat we are interested in, which is stored in the channel variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, in the participants variable we will get a list of objects that contain information about each user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For clarity, we will prescribe in advance the recording of the received information in a text file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;.txt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"w"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"utf-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Be sure to specify the encoding to avoid problems with nicknames containing characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's iterate through our users in a loop but using our tqdm library&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;participant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ALL_PARTICIPANTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="nb"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;writelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;" ID: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;participant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; "&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;" First_Name:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;participant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;first_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is the result on the example of the first found chat about Python:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JBhwV7jY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c93slbdcode38uemk5n9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JBhwV7jY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c93slbdcode38uemk5n9.png" alt="Example" width="880" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the root of our program, we have a file {channel name}.txt which contains information about users&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ujQL4Kqd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m6g2pfiuqh0qpfs63x2e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ujQL4Kqd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m6g2pfiuqh0qpfs63x2e.png" alt="Users" width="880" height="478"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To run our parsing, in a file &lt;strong&gt;links.txt&lt;/strong&gt; you need to insert a link to a chat or group. You can find this link in the chat description.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EEAIoCkV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v1vuqev0avyp9etuxxns.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EEAIoCkV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v1vuqev0avyp9etuxxns.png" alt="Links" width="880" height="372"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Important! You will not be able to parse the channel because you are not its administrator. To parse a chat or a group, you need to be subscribed to them.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be many links to chats. It is important to write them from a new line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfectly! We just downloaded the list of chat users. We found out their unique identifiers (IDs), which will help us in the future to find messages of a certain user in this (or in any other chat). We will talk about unloading messages from the chat in part 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your attention! Write about your impressions in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

                          &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;" Channel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'The end!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-wish-you-success"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I wish you success!
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Vs TypeScript</title>
      <author>Sneha Maurya</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 14:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sneha025/javascript-vs-typescript-43li</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sneha025/javascript-vs-typescript-43li</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the differences let's have a little background on both languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; (often shortened as JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification and is used to make interactive web pages. JavaScript is used on both client-side and server-side that allows programmers to make web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt; (Often shortened as TS) is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strongly typed superset of Javascript, cross-platform, object-oriented, compiles to plain javascript language, and is used to make interactive web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When we have JavaScript as a client-side and server-side technology, then why we needed TypeScript?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know by the development of Nodejs, JavaScript has become more popular than it was before due to server-side and client-side web development. However, when JavaScript was growing then the code getting more complex and making it difficult to maintain the reusability of code. It was not able to fulfill the necessity of Object-Oriented programming. These flaws hinder JavaScript from succeeding at the enterprise level as a server-side technology. Then TypeScript comes into the picture to fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TypeScript is an Object-oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is an Object-oriented scripting language &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object-oriented programming languages are based on objects whereas scripting languages are made up of scripts to automate any function/action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripting languages don't need a compilation step and mostly get interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript always calls attention to errors during the development period but JavaScript highlights at the runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TypeScript support static typing but javaScript has dynamic typing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript assigns the type to any variable at runtime(dynamically typed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript gives the option for static typing, the type of a variable is declared while writing the code. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; name_ =&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"JavaScript"&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"name variable is infered as string"&lt;/span&gt;,names);&lt;br&gt;
name_=&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"name variable is infered as number "&lt;/span&gt;,names);&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in TypeScript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let name_ = &lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"TypeScript"&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="hljs-built_in"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.log(&lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"name variable is infered as string"&lt;/span&gt;,name_);&lt;br&gt;
name_=&lt;span class="hljs-number"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;;    &lt;span class="hljs-regexp"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="hljs-keyword"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; error &lt;span class="hljs-string"&gt;"Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string' "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When a language is not statically typed, it is more prone to errors in runtime.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TypeScript support interface but Javascript does not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being an object-oriented programming language TypeScript s supports  OOPs 
concepts like interfaces, classes, inheritances, generics, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits TypeScript provides over JavaScript like it helps to make code management easier, increases team performance by the explicitly defined data structure, and variables type annotation make code by far easier to comprehend the decisions made by the other engineers who were working originally on your codebase.
TypeScript is getting popular and adopted by the Industry giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/typescript"&gt;NPM downloads in the past 2 years&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is an awesome tool for JavaScript developers. It makes large codebases easy to understand and gives a fine code-writing toolkit as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for now, thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating an NFT on Solana with Metaplex Candy Machine. </title>
      <author>Devind Dev</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 14:16:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devindxdeveloper/creating-an-nft-on-solana-with-metaplex-candy-machine-4agp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devindxdeveloper/creating-an-nft-on-solana-with-metaplex-candy-machine-4agp</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#guide-overiew"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Guide Overiew
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what felt like walking through a mine field trying to figure out how to create my own NFT on Solana with the current guides, I decided to put together a guide myself in a very beginner friendly fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't be taking a deeper dive into the specifics of how everything works, but rather help people with zero knowledge of rust obtain a general understanding on how to create their very own NFT on Solana with the help of Metaplex candy machine and a web starter kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I used &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu 21.10 - Wayland&lt;/strong&gt; for it. Some things may vary depending on the operating system you are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-metaplex-candy-machine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Metaplex Candy Machine?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Metaplex&lt;/code&gt; is a command line tool that interacts with the candy-machine program. In this guide, we will use it to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Upload&lt;/em&gt; your images along with their metadata to &lt;em&gt;arweave&lt;/em&gt;, then register them on the Solana blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Verify&lt;/em&gt; that the state of your candy machine is valid and complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mint&lt;/em&gt; individual tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Candy Machine&lt;/code&gt; is a system that manages fair mints.&lt;br&gt;
• The minting process starts and finishes at the same time for everyone.&lt;br&gt;
• It won't accept your funds if there are no more NFTs to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(version 14.17.6)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools"&gt;SolanaCLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex.git"&gt;Metaplex CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://phantom.app/"&gt;Phantom Wallet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a different version of Node installed on your system, you can use &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-the-solanacli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing The SolanaCLI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solana already has really well made guides on installing and using the Solana command line.&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools"&gt;Install Solana Command Line Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-devnet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Devnet
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devnet is really useful for developers to test out their programs and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set your default Solana url to devnet using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's create a devnet wallet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/devnet.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember to store your seed phrase somewhere safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend making devnet your default &lt;em&gt;keypair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#funding-the-devnet-wallet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Funding The Devnet Wallet
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let’s make sure that we’re on devnet by checking the configuration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ solana config get
//Output:
Config File: /Users/dev/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/dev/.config/solana/devnet.json
Commitment: confirmed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s fund that wallet:&lt;br&gt;
Firstly, We check the balance of our current wallet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ solana balance 
//Output:
0 SOL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we airdrop the amount of SOL to our wallet. Remember, the amount is capped to 5 SOL.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ solana airdrop 4
//Output
Requesting airdrop of 4

Signature: Transaction Signature

4 SOL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, Let’s check our balance to confirm the airdrop was successful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ solana balance
//Output:
4 SOL //This can vary depending on the balance you initially had.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re confused by any of the above steps, you can check the manuals to get a better understanding by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ solana help config
$ solana help balance
$ solana help airdrop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-phantom-wallet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring Phantom Wallet
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up your phantom wallet, we can link our newly created devnet wallet above to phantom.&lt;br&gt;
To do so, first we need to open its settings, click on &lt;code&gt;Change Network&lt;/code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Devnet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to obtain the devnet wallet private key. To obtain that, open your terminal and &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; to view the contents of the &lt;code&gt;keypair.json&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat .config/solana/devnet.json
//Output:
[12,22,.....]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now copy the output you received and open phantom wallet. Click on the top left navigation menu and click on &lt;code&gt;Add/Connect Wallet&lt;/code&gt; and then click on &lt;code&gt;Import Private Key&lt;/code&gt; and give it a suitable name and paste the contents we copied before in the Private Key field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to see 4 SOL in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-candy-machine-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running Candy Machine CLI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please ensure that you have &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; installed before proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also install &lt;code&gt;ts-node&lt;/code&gt; by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ npm install -g ts-node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s clone the metaplex project into the location of your choice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex.git
$ cd metaplex/js
$ yarn install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn bootstrap &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yarn build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run the command line utility,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$  ts-node metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts help
Usage: candy-machine-cli [options] [command]

  verify_price [options]
  create_candy_machine [options]
  update_candy_machine [options]

  sign [options]
  sign_candy_machine_metadata [options]
  help [command]                         display help for command
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#organizing-amp-uploading-your-assets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Organizing &amp;amp; Uploading Your Assets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this guide, we will be using pre-made assets which you can download by &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DoV44eED8PrgmMeAL-i-ceJ3NAx1ND5L?usp=sharing"&gt;clicking here.&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of &lt;a href="https://github.com/kevinfaveri/solana-candy-factory"&gt;solana-candy-factory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Place this &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; folder in a suitable location.&lt;br&gt;
Here is how you should organize your NFT files to upload:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls assets | sort -n
0.json
0.png
1.json
1.png
2.json
2.png
3.json
3.png
....
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can notice that these files come in numerical pairs, that is &lt;code&gt;1.png&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1.json&lt;/code&gt; are the two halves of the NFT. The &lt;code&gt;png&lt;/code&gt; file is the art work and the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; file contains the metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directory name &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; does not matter. You can go with anything you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#validating-your-assets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Validating Your Assets
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may feel tedious but it's just as important. Checkout the the manual on carrying this out at&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard"&gt;https://docs.metaplex.com/nft-standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#uploading-your-project-assets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Uploading Your Project Assets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the funds, assets all organized and vaidated, we can proceed with the fun stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will proceed with uploading our assets with the CLI. Remember, our assets are located at &lt;code&gt;metaplex\js\packages\cli\example-assets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ts-node metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts upload assets --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json

//Output
Processing file: 0
Processing file: 1
Processing file: 2
Processing file: 3
Done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By uploading, it sends the files to Arweave and also registers those files with your candy machine. Both Arweave and Solana are initialized after a successful run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#validating-your-candy-machine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Validating Your Candy Machine
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can confirm the health and status of your on-chain assets using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ts-node metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts verify --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
//Output:
Looking at key  0
Name {redacted-name} 0 with https://arweave.net/{redacted-tx-id} checked out
Looking at key  1
Name {redacted-name} 1 with https://arweave.net/{redacted-tx-id} checked out
Looking at key  2
Name {redacted-name} 2 with https://arweave.net/{redacted-tx-id} checked out
Looking at key  3
Name {redacted-name} 3 with https://arweave.net/{redacted-tx-id} checked out
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starting-your-candy-machine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starting Your Candy Machine
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After verifying that our assets are good to go, we can finally start the candy machine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ ts-node metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts create_candy_machine --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#updating-your-candy-machine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Updating Your Candy Machine
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can modify our candy machine details to include a start date and/or price etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ts-node metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts update_candy_machine --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json --price 1 --date "29 Oct 2021 00:12:00 GMT"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#minting-our-nft"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Minting Our NFT
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mint our NFT, we can use &lt;code&gt;mint_one_token&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ts-node metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts mint_one_token --env devnet --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, you can now open your phantom wallet, open the collectibles page (It's beside the $ symbol on the bottom) and voila! Your newly minted NFT will be there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-web-starter-kit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting Up The Web Starter Kit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've successfully minted an NFT into our wallet, let's make a web application to carry out the mint instead! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This project is very new and could cause some issues, if it does then please report it on github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is for you to be able to configure it and customize it to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fork the project and then clone it to your desired location.&lt;br&gt;
Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/exiled-apes/candy-machine-mint"&gt;https://github.com/exiled-apes/candy-machine-mint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to build the project,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd candy-machine-mint
yarn install
yarn build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where things get a little bit complicated. When we uploaded our NFTs, a cache file was created in the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; directory as our assets directory. However, this &lt;code&gt;.cache&lt;/code&gt; folder is hidden! If you're on ubuntu, use &lt;code&gt;ctrl+h&lt;/code&gt; to display hidden files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have discovered that folder, open it and you'll find &lt;code&gt;devnet-temp&lt;/code&gt; file. Open it in your IDE and you'll see the following&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"program"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"uuid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Ch3xxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"config"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Ch3xxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"items"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://arweave.net/xxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TEST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"onChain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://arweave.net/xxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TEST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"onChain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://arweave.net/xxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TEST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"onChain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://arweave.net/xxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TEST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"onChain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://arweave.net/xxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TEST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"onChain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://arweave.net/xxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"TEST"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"onChain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"env"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"devnet"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"cacheName"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"temp"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"authority"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"9xJxxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"candyMachineAddress"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"3Wmxxxx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"startDate"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1632615120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We're going to need all this data when we run our web application to mint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-candymachinemint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring Candy-Machine-Mint
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up the candy-machine-mint folder, where you will find a file called &lt;code&gt;.env.example&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
(The file is usually hidden, use &lt;code&gt;ctrl+h&lt;/code&gt; to display hidden files)&lt;br&gt;
Rename it to &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; and then open it to edit the following details:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REACT_APP_CANDY_MACHINE_CONFIG=__PLACEHOLDER__
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code&gt;program.config&lt;/code&gt; key from our &lt;code&gt;.cache/devnet-temp&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REACT_APP_CANDY_MACHINE_ID=__PLACEHOLDER__
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code&gt;candyMachineAddress&lt;/code&gt; from our &lt;code&gt;.cache/devnet-temp&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REACT_APP_TREASURY_ADDRESS=__PLACEHOLDER__
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This the Solana address that receives the funds gathered during the minting process. You can set this to your devnet wallet address.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REACT_APP_CANDY_START_DATE=__PLACEHOLDER__
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code&gt;startDate&lt;/code&gt; key from our &lt;code&gt;.cache/devnet-temp&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;br&gt;
Note: If you cannot find it, use &lt;code&gt;update_candy_machine&lt;/code&gt; as mentioned above as you may have missed out on mentioning the date.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This identifies the Solana network you want to connect to. Options are devnet, testnet, and mainnet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC_HOST=https://explorer-api.devnet.solana.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This identifies the RPC server your web app will access the Solana network through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starting-the-web-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starting The Web Application
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your terminal and navigate to the &lt;code&gt;candy-machine-mint&lt;/code&gt; directory and start the react app by using &lt;code&gt;yarn start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you see &lt;em&gt;Compiled Successfully&lt;/em&gt; in your terminal, Open &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; to view it in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now proceed with connecting your wallet, and clicking on the &lt;strong&gt;mint&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After clicking on the &lt;strong&gt;mint&lt;/strong&gt; button, you can check the collectibles page on your phantom wallet and you'll see your newly minted NFT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I will be covering in this guide. If you encounter any issues, comment down below and I’ll try to help!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HOW TO LEARN TO CODE AS A BEGINNER</title>
      <author>webcodespace</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 13:57:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/webcodespace/how-to-learn-to-code-as-a-beginner-j28</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/webcodespace/how-to-learn-to-code-as-a-beginner-j28</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to learn a new technical skill, and you've heard a lot about programming and you've decided this is the new skill you want to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You keep wondering how you are going to acquire this new skill of programming and as a result you start googling a lot of things about programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that, the internet is full with a lot of information about what you should and shouldn't do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have a lot of people presenting you with a lot of technology to learn and by the end of the day, you're going to get confused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to be talking about four steps you can take if you want to learn how to code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-set-a-goal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Set a goal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EcOQkFSi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jf8vp54yrk4ymdwevwia.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EcOQkFSi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jf8vp54yrk4ymdwevwia.jpg" alt="how to learn programming" width="880" height="517"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really important. Not just in programming but everything else. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to be able to build? Which area of programming do you want to go into? You need to have answers to these questions. Without a set goal, you're going to spend more time trying to learn how to code and nothing will ever really satisfy you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step can actually take you quite some time, but it is definitely worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-choose-a-programming-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Choose a programming language:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j9EMLMXl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wvsf9lflw7rcffpsctno.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j9EMLMXl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wvsf9lflw7rcffpsctno.jpg" alt="learn to code" width="880" height="473"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've completed the first step, you'll be ready to &lt;a href="https://www.webcodespace.com/best-programming-languages-for-beginners"&gt;choose your first programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing your first programming language can sometimes be a hassle for a lot of beginners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of amazing options out there and sometimes you just wish you can learn them all, all at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, before picking up a new programming language, you need to consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-the-popularity-of-that-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  a. The popularity of that language
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dTOy0AJp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhgskcv5521b43lkc4ms.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dTOy0AJp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhgskcv5521b43lkc4ms.jpg" alt="how to choose a programming language" width="880" height="622"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this is so important is because you need to a language that is already used by a lot of programmers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are a lot of programmers using this particular language, it will be easier to find tutorials or code examples to learn from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a beginner, it wouldn't be very nice to start switching between different programming languages in order to learn new concepts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#b-the-job-market"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  b. The job market
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f8aoQfq1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i7g36ycz5ouibx86c3j6.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f8aoQfq1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i7g36ycz5ouibx86c3j6.jpg" alt="beginner programmer" width="880" height="530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people actually go into programming because they believe they can find a promising job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those people, then it will be really important to check out the job opportunities available to you both locally and remotely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are learning how to program because of job opportunities and there are a lot of javascript jobs available around you, it wouldn't really be advisable to learn something else like java or ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#c-your-interest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  c. Your interest
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R69T82x0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iob42b4p4y9u0sm3nit9.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R69T82x0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iob42b4p4y9u0sm3nit9.jpg" alt="learn code" width="880" height="586"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all about what really excites you about programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you love to play and build games? You can become a game developer. Do you think you will enjoy coding out web applications? You can consider web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing the things that really excite you, can really help you learn faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#d-learning-curve"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  d. Learning curve
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QGg-g3ln--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zcp3vccdq3dewnxgaq2i.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QGg-g3ln--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zcp3vccdq3dewnxgaq2i.jpg" alt="coding tutorial" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose something easy, you're just starting out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a good understanding of the basics of programming can really help you to become a very good programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best programmers know their basics very well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose an easy language, it will be easier for you to learn those basic programming concepts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't be very nice that while you are trying to learn those new concepts, you also struggle to understand the syntax of a new programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-look-for-a-course"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Look for a course:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yX6bjEwl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xb2uahif0jiafmj4e7qi.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yX6bjEwl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xb2uahif0jiafmj4e7qi.jpg" alt="programmer guide" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days there are a lot of resources online to help you learn code. There are both free and paid ones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go through YouTube and find cool videos that can help you learn or you can also buy a course on udemy. It's totally up to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to find content that you can easily understand. If you come across anything you don't understand, you can google them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would advise that you find a course that has a good structure and gradually follow it step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-practice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Practice
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iwv1bo-_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2yln6a00nao85a4gvo9i.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iwv1bo-_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2yln6a00nao85a4gvo9i.jpg" alt="webcodespace" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming is a skill, and just like every other skill, you need to practice in order to become proficient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are done with your courses and you have a good understanding of the basics, you can move on to practicing and building out projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start building out your dream projects. This is where the real fun begins. This is really important because once you successfully complete one project, it will prompt you to build another. And by the time you successfully complete a lot of projects, your skill and experience will develop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to code still remains one of the most valuable skill anyone can learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be patient with the learning process and soon you'll begin to notice progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy coding!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Form validation using javascript</title>
      <author>Adam Nagy</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 13:51:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/form-validation-using-javascript-34je</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with forms is an every day task for almost every web developer. No matter what site you'll create it will use forms. Validating the form data on the client side is a nice-to-have feature when it comes to user experience. In this tutorial we'll create a simple form validation using javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While client-side form validation gives a nice user experience, it can be tricked and bypassed really easily. To prevent malicious use, &lt;strong&gt;you should always validate form data on the server side&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#video-tutorial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Video Tutorial
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would watch a detailed step-by-step video instead you can check out the video I made covering this project on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptAcademyOfficial"&gt;my Youtube Channel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYlNJpltjMM"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the HTML markup. We'll have a &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; div, that we'll use to position and style our form. Inside that, not surprisingly, we'll create a &lt;code&gt;form&lt;/code&gt;, we also set an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; for it, and set the &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; since we don't really want to submit this form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll create four input fields, for the username, email, password, and password confirmation. For styling and control purposes we'll wrap these &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; tags into &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;s with the class &lt;code&gt;input control&lt;/code&gt;. Each of these input controls will contain a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;, and a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; with the class &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt;. Every input should have an id and name attribute. The label's should have a matching &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; property with the corresponding input tag's name attribute. For the input type we will use &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; for the username and email, and use &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; for the password and the password confirmation. The div with the &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; class will hold the error messages for the specific input field. It will be empty for now, we will modify it from javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have to add a button to "submit" our form. In this example we won't really submit the form just simulate it. For the submit button I'll use a button with a type of &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Registration&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input-control"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"username"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Username&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"username"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"username"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input-control"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input-control"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Password&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"input-control"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Password again&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password2"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sign Up&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is the HTML markup that we need for our form. Let's style it a bit with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll give a simple clean spacious design for this tutorial. I'll set a linear gradient as the background and I'll use a custom google font, that you can &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins"&gt;install from here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#0f2027&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#203a43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2c5364&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Poppins'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'll give a fix width to our form, and center it with margins, also I'll give it a top margin to move it down a bit vertically. To have more space we apply 20px of padding. We'll set a fixed font size, a light background color and also set a border radius to have rounded corners.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;300px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20vh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;whitesmoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the form title, we'll use a dark text color, and center it horizontally using &lt;code&gt;text-align: center&lt;/code&gt;. The submit button should stand out so we'll use a blue background color, and white text color. We also remove the browser default borders and give it a little border-radius. We'll give it a little spacing with paddings and margins, and make it full-width by applying 100% width.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#0f2027&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;194&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To have the inputs stacked below each other we'll use flexbox. To do that we'll set &lt;code&gt;display: flex;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column&lt;/code&gt;. For the inputs we'll set a grey border, with a little border-radius. We'll set the display property to &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;, and make them full-width, by applying width 100%. We'll also set a little padding, so it'll be more spacious. I'll also remove the outline when the input is in focus, by setting &lt;code&gt;outline: 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.input-control&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.input-control&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#f0f0f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.input-control&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:focus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'll use two classes ("success" and "error") to give visual feedback to the user on whether the input's value is valid or not. We'll apply these classes from javascript to the input-control div which contains the specific input field. When the success class is present we will set a green border color, otherwise if error is present we'll use a red border color instead. For the error div we'll use a smaller font-size and a red color to show the error messages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.input-control.success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#09c372&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.input-control.error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff3860&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.input-control&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff3860&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;13px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's do the validation in javascript next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Javascript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we have to do is to save references for the form, and the input fields. As we gave id for every input and the form we can easily to do by using &lt;code&gt;getElementById&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prevent the form for automatically submit we have to attach and event listener to our form's &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt; event. In this event handler function we have to call &lt;code&gt;preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; function to prevent the form from submitting automatically. Instead of submitting we'll call the &lt;code&gt;validateInputs&lt;/code&gt; function, which will validate the inputs and if we want to we can submit the form in there after every check passes, but we won't do that in this tutorial. We'll create this &lt;code&gt;validateInputs&lt;/code&gt; shortly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validateInputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'll also create two helper functions: &lt;code&gt;setError&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setSuccess&lt;/code&gt;. We'll use these helper functions to set the error or success states of the input controls. Let's start with the setError one. It receives two parameters: &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt;. The element will be the input element that is in the specific input-control. So first we have to get the input control parent div. We'll save it into the &lt;code&gt;inputControl&lt;/code&gt; variable, and get the input control div by using the &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; property of the input element. Next we have to gather the error div, and save it into a variable. We can do that by querying the input control with the error class.&lt;br&gt;
Now we have to set the error div's innerText to be the message that we got in parameters, and remove the &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; class from the input control (if it exists) and add the error class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorDisplay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorDisplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The setSuccess method will be really similar. The first difference is that it won't receive a message as a parameter. We have to clear the error display by setting its innerText to an empty string. Lastly we have to reverse the class application. We'll add the &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; class to the inputControl and remove the &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; class (if present).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSuccess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorDisplay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorDisplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputControl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will create one last helper function to validate emails. This is an optional step, if you don't want to use regular expressions, feel free to just set the input type of the email field to &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;isValidEmail&lt;/code&gt; function will take a string as a parameter and use this weird looking regular expression to check whether it is a valid email or not. We'll use &lt;code&gt;String.test()&lt;/code&gt; function to test the string against the regex. We'll also convert the email to a string and make it lowercase.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValidEmail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;(([^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\]\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;.,;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;@"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;(\.[^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;()[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\]\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;.,;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;@"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;".+"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;((\[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]{1,3}\.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]{1,3}\.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]{1,3}\.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]{1,3}\])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;(([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;a-zA-Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;a-zA-Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]{2,}))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we should create the validator &lt;code&gt;validateInputs&lt;/code&gt; function. First we will get the value of all the input fields. We can do that by getting the value property's value of the input field references. We'll call the &lt;code&gt;String.trim()&lt;/code&gt; function to remove the trailing empty spaces (if any) from the start and end of the values.&lt;br&gt;
Then we can start validating inputs. We'll use &lt;code&gt;if, else&lt;/code&gt; statements to do the validation. For the username we will check whether if it is empty or not, by comparing the value with an empty string. If it empty, we'll call the &lt;code&gt;setError&lt;/code&gt; function and provide the username element to it, with our error message. Otherwise we'll call the &lt;code&gt;setSuccess&lt;/code&gt; method with the username element. Now we have to do this for the other input fields, but the approach will be the same.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validateInputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;passwordValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Username is required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the email we'll check if it is provided or not, and set an error if it is empty. If it is not empty we'll check whether it is a valid email address, and if not we'll set an error, otherwise we set success for the field.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Email is required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isValidEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Provide a valid email address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the password we'll check whether it is empty or not, and if it is not empty we'll check if it is longer than 7 characters. If not, well set an error, otherwise we'll set it as success.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;passwordValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Password is required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;passwordValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Password must be at least 8 character.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the password confirmation we'll check if it is empty, and we should also check if the password confirmation's value is equal to the password's value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Please confirm your password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;passwordValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Passwords doesn't match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have every input validated, if we wanted to we could submit our form now to a specific endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good job now you have a working form validation Javascript. Please note that you always have to validate the form inputs on the server-side as client-side validation can be easily bypassed. There are way more advanced form validation methods and libraries that we use in modern web development, but this project is a really good way to start and learn the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hawk is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.&lt;br&gt;
Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ifconfig, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ping, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traceroute, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan), 
host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banner grabbing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS checks (with geolocation information), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WHOIS, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subdomain enumeration, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vulnerability reconnaissance, - &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;packet sniffing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAC spoofing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP spoofing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYN flooding, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deauth attack, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;brute-force attack (beta).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.&lt;br&gt;
