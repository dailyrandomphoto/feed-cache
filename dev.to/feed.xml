      <description>&lt;p&gt;Creating you own own product can be an exciting journey. It's awesome to see your business ideas coming to life and develop a successful career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indie hackers, entrepreneurs and builders in public, could you share your most successful project and it's approx. *MRR?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;MRR (Monthly recurring revenue) is a metric that shows the total revenue generated per month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git Commits and Commit Messages : The Final Guide</title>
      <author>ZigRazor</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:24:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/zigrazor/git-commits-and-commit-messages-the-final-guide-2g6f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/zigrazor/git-commits-and-commit-messages-the-final-guide-2g6f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A commit should be a self-contained update to the code tree.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite bug fixes that could be introduced later in the development, a commit should be never considered as &lt;em&gt;"I’m saving my work now, I’ll continue later"&lt;/em&gt;, especially if the commit is pushed to a remote repository.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, a commit should not contain multiple changes to the code base. &lt;br&gt;
If, during development, I have to change something in two different modules, and the changes are unrelated, then the changes should be placed in two different commits.&lt;br&gt;
That is: &lt;strong&gt;make separate commits for logically separate changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Making good commits is a form of art. A good way to decide whether a commit is self contained, developers should answer themselves he question: "will I be able to cherry pick this commit in the future, shall I need it?". If the answer is yes, then most&lt;br&gt;
likely it is a good commit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Commit messages should be meaningful&lt;/strong&gt;. A one-line commit message like &lt;em&gt;"I’m developing foo"&lt;/em&gt; will not allow other developers to understand what that commit is for. A minimal&lt;br&gt;
commit message would be of the format:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Short log
(Optional pointers to external resources, such as defect tracking)
The intent of your change.
(Optional, if it's not clear from above) how your change resolves the
issues in the first part.
Tag line(s) at the end.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a good commit message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;foobar: Adjusted the foo setting in bar When using foobar on systems with less than a gigabyte of RAM common usage patterns often result in an Out-of-memory condition causing slowdowns and unexpected application termination.

Low-memory systems should continue to function without running into memory-starvation conditions with minimal cost to systems with more available memory. High-memory systems will be less able to use the full extent of the system, a dynamically tunable option may be best, long-term.

The foo setting in bar was decreased from X to X-50% in order to
ensure we don't exhaust all system memory with foobar threads.

Signed-off-by: Joe Developer &amp;lt;joe.developer@example.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several things should be noted here. The minimal commit message is good for new code development and simple changes. An empty line must always come after it, otherwise post processing software might not be able to distinguish it from the rest of the&lt;br&gt;
commit text.&lt;br&gt;
The single short log message indicates what needed to be changed. It should begin with an indicator as to the primary item changed by this work, followed by a short summary of the change. In the above case we're indicating that we've changed the "foobar" item, by "adjusting the foo setting in bar".&lt;br&gt;
The single short log message is analogous to the git "commit summary". While no maximum line length is specified by this policy, it is suggested that it remains under&lt;br&gt;
50 characters wherever possible. Think of it as the subject of an email: you should never write too much text in it, otherwise receivers will not understand easily what the email is about.&lt;br&gt;
Optionally, you may include pointers to defects this change &lt;br&gt;
corrects. Unless the defect format is specified by the component you are modifying, it is suggested that you use a full URL to specify the reference to the defect information. Generally, these pointers will precede any long description, but as an optional item it may be after the long description. This could be a good way, for example, to refer to open issues in a bug tracker. You must then have a full description of the change. &lt;br&gt;
Specifying the intent of your change and if necessary how the change resolves the issue.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, one or more tag lines should exist. Each developer responsible for working on the patch is responsible for adding a Signed-off-by: tag line. This tag line should be added by people writing the patch, and additional tag lines should be added by&lt;br&gt;
people, for example, merging the patch into different branches. This allows to easily track the updates to the code base, and determine who did what.&lt;br&gt;
It is not acceptable to have an empty or non-existent header, or just a single line message. The summary and description is required for all changes. The commit messages should be manually indented. Usually, each line of the message, should not be longer than 78 characters. Note that in order to do this easily, is&lt;br&gt;
always better to avoid using the &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; switch when committing: in fact, simply issuing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;will fire up the text editor specified in the EDITOR environment variable (you can set it to your preferred editor), so that you can freely write your commit message respecting the adopted layout. Note that if you set your favorite editor to vim, you can add the following lines to &lt;code&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;filetype plugin indent on
au FileType gitcommit set tw=72
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;which automatically wraps the text to the specified 72 characters for git commit messages. To check whether vim is correctly identifying the commit message as gitcommit, the following command can be used within vi:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;:set filetype?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or to save a few keystrokes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;:se ft?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If, for any reason, you have pushed commits with non-meaningful descriptions (due to hurry, pressure, git fire , etc.), these should never end up in the master branch.&lt;br&gt;
Here, interactively rebasing you local branch (and issuing a force push if possible) is a good practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How do you get new clients?</title>
      <author>Madza</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 06:52:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/madza/how-do-you-get-new-business-clients-1cp2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/madza/how-do-you-get-new-business-clients-1cp2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The success of any business depends on the substantive clientele. Some of the most common ways to get new clients include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media like &lt;a href="https://linkedin.com"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelance sites like &lt;a href="(https://upwork.com)"&gt;UpWork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="(https://freelancern.com)"&gt;Freelancer&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job listing sites like &lt;a href="https://weworkremotely.com"&gt;WeWorkRemotely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://remoteok.io"&gt;RemoteOk&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References from existing clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been the most effective strategy for you and why?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why not TOML?</title>
      <author>Siddharth</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 06:13:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/siddharthshyniben/why-not-toml-1fj9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/siddharthshyniben/why-not-toml-1fj9</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# this is some TOML&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="py"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'TOML'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[created-by]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Tom Preston-Werner'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;dob&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1979-05-27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00-08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://toml.io/"&gt;TOML&lt;/a&gt; is a configuration file format designed like an "improved" &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file"&gt;INI file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, TOML looks like a simple, readable file format. If you use it infrequently on small, simple files, it's fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you use it more, you will start seeing the flaws of TOML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Vejnar, the creator of &lt;a href="https://github.com/avakar/pytoml/issues/15#issuecomment-217739462"&gt;PyTOML&lt;/a&gt;, said the exact same thing. He initially built the parser out of enthusiasm for TOML, but eventually abandoned it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOML is a bad file format. It looks good at first glance, and for really really trivial things it is probably good. But once I started using it and the configuration schema became more complex, I found the syntax ugly and hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what's the problem with TOML?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-its-verbose"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. It's verbose
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a yaml document:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;rigid&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;better for data interchange&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;slim and flexible&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;better for configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;null_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;&amp;amp;example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;aliases are like variables&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;*example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;paragraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;Blank lines denote&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="s"&gt;paragraph breaks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;&amp;amp;foo&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;alias_reuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;*foo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And here's the same thing in TOML:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"rigid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"better for data interchange"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="py"&gt;yaml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"slim and flexible"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;"better for configuration"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="py"&gt;paragraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""
Blank lines denote
paragraph breaks
"""&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[object]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"value"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[[object.array]]&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[[object.array]]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[[object.array]]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[[object.array]]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"aliases are like variables"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[[object.array]]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"aliases are like variables"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[alias]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"baz"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[alias_reuse]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"baz"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first YAML examples is 368 characters. The second is 455 characters. That's about 100 more characters you need to type. TOML re-introduces what human friendly languages are trying to get rid of: verbose syntax, the necessity to quote strings, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons are obvious:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have an array, you need to repeat the key again and again (&lt;code&gt;[[object.array]]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of syntactic extras like square brackets and quotes which dominate TOML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no alias system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making programs smaller and DRYer significantly reduces the number of bugs. The same can apply for configuration files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-toml-looks-like-it-was-designed-for-parsers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. TOML looks like it was designed for parsers.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchy in TOML is determined by &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;s. This is simple enough for parsers to understand, but this makes it difficult for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why many people have adopted this style:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[markup]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[markup.tableOfContents]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;endLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;startLevel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;[markup.highlight]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"solarized-dark"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this makes it easier to understand, &lt;strong&gt;it would be much better if we could get rid of the dots (and brackets) and just use indent alone&lt;/strong&gt;. This is why I love the Python syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still debates about whether using indentation alone was a good idea, but it generally is, as discussed in this &lt;a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/313034/why-should-a-language-prefer-indentation-over-explicit-markers-for-blocks"&gt;StackExchange question&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-toml-has-too-many-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. TOML has too many features.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOML's creator &lt;a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#comparison-with-other-formats"&gt;criticizes&lt;/a&gt; YAML for having too many features and then does the same thing. Ironic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, TOML has first class dates. If you have been programming for any amount of time, you know the problems associated with date and time (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; momentjs &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion there should only be 5 types: string, number, boolean, array, object. This is the approach JSON took, and it's a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-syntax-typing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Syntax typing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"string"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TOML lets the users decide what type a thing is. But in most cases, this is not correct as the client should decide what type a thing should have. If the types are incorrect they should be coerced or an error should be thrown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-tomls-rules-arent-that-obvious"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. TOML's rules aren't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; obvious
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of TOML is obvious, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;[[syntax]]&lt;/code&gt; is confusing. It looks like a &lt;code&gt;[object]&lt;/code&gt; with an extra &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; pair around it, but it's used to signify an array.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you think I've missed any points (a lot!), or if you disagree with any points I've made, please leave a comment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually have a lot more points to tell, and I'll write a longer article another day. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Cryptocurrency Exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange or Digital currency exchange (DCE) is websites where traders can buy and sell or exchange one Cryptocurrency to another digital-currency or fiat currency. On cryptocurrency exchanges, Users can make instant transactions with Cryptocurrencies in a highly secured manner. A typical cryptocurrency exchange works 24/7, that is, it never closes. One of the main reasons traders like them is their anonymity feature. Nobody knows who are the buyers and sellers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iSN7ECmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ft7j0k6d4ul4nry8wq67.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iSN7ECmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ft7j0k6d4ul4nry8wq67.png" alt="cryptocurrency exchange development"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-benefits-of-developing-a-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The benefits of developing a cryptocurrency exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other benefits in crypto exchange and that’s why it is growing day by day. So as more people get interested in this market the demand for exchange platforms increase. Therefore, as a business owner, you have to see the factors and come to a conclusion that developing a digital currency exchange site is an important step to expand your business. &lt;br&gt;
The fact that the cryptocurrency market is usually available for trading 24/7 because there is no centralized monitor of the market is one of the reasons that make this industry grow faster. The cryptocurrency transactions take place directly between individuals and it helps traders to trade with other people all over the globe. This gives them the opportunity of trading with a wide range of people and traders.&lt;br&gt;
The factor that measures the speed and Ease of converting a cryptocurrency into cash without impacting the market price is called liquidity. Liquidity is an important factor because it brings faster transactions (actually it reduces the time of the transactions), better prices, and accuracy for technical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Does a Cryptocurrency Exchange Work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word cryptocurrency has been derived from the term Cryptography that means to encrypt transactions and regulate the assembly of the currency. Bitcoin is a world’s first decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency. The success of Bitcoin has paved ways for the new cryptocurrencies to arise. The open-source nature of Bitcoin has led to the development of hundreds of new digital tokens also known as Altcoins or Bitcoin clones. There are some of the most-sought after cryptocurrencies like Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, Ether, and Monero. In the present era, cryptocurrency has become a preferred choice for online users who are willingly ready to invest online. Excepting few constraints there are not much that could demotivate the virtual currency enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#all-types-of-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  All types of cryptocurrency exchanges
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#centralized-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Centralized Exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most common type of exchange. Such exchanges have a centralized operator who is responsible for security, updates, and functionality. Centralized exchanges manage order books, which record all buy and sell orders. The weak point of this type is that coins are stored in the services themselves, which increases the likelihood of losing your funds due to hacker attacks. Therefore, centralized exchanges work hard to ensure the proper level of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decentralized-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decentralized Exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralized exchanges provide transfers of funds directly between users' wallets. This reduces the potential for theft from exchange hacking since the exchange never actually stores cryptocurrency. However, you should keep in mind that in such exchanges, the lack of moderating third-party shifts all responsibility for errors and security to the users themselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hybrid-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hybrid Exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It incorporates both the exchange systems' features and provides an upgraded solution to users' shortcomings in these systems. Here users have full control over their funds, and their privacy and security are highly maintained. The transactions taking place in the system are monitored and updated in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How much does it cost to build a cryptocurrency exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of cryptocurrency exchange development depends on the list of features to include, the number of coins and tokens to be integrated, the level of security, and so on. Therefore, you will be able to calculate the estimated cost after sharing your idea and vision with experts.&lt;br&gt;
Regarding various challenges that you need to overcome while building your own cryptocurrency exchange facilities, it cannot but be a costly process. However, with a smart attitude and much of entrepreneurial spirit, you will be able to launch your startup with a very reasonable pricing policy.&lt;br&gt;
Regardless of your choice of software, your perfect team should include project manager (unless you don’t want to take this position by your own), platform developer, QA engineer, experienced web designer, and a UI developer. The cost of their services will vary significantly depending on several factors. The most important here is probably your team’s country of location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-i-create-a-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do I create a Cryptocurrency exchange?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a Bitcoin exchange involves six basic steps:&lt;br&gt;
• Decide where you want to do business.&lt;br&gt;
• Learn about relevant regulations in that area.&lt;br&gt;
• Partner with a bank or payment processor.&lt;br&gt;
• Establish a transaction history and liquidity on the exchange.&lt;br&gt;
• Implement best security practices.&lt;br&gt;
• Offer customer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-cryptocurrency-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Cryptocurrency exchange development?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto currency transactions are recorded on the Blockchain, paving way for a decentralized value exchange. A Cryptocurrency Exchange development enables buyers and sellers to exchange their coins with other coins or to further sell or buy the crypto currency with the market trends.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--erKMyMRH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cox7dolu4di2ddnckoji.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--erKMyMRH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cox7dolu4di2ddnckoji.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency Exchange Development Company"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain advocates a ledger system that facilitates the recording of every cryptocurrency transaction which in turn paves way for a value exchange on a decentralized basis. With a customizable crypto exchange script, you shall be a vital part of the digital revolution coming your way.&lt;br&gt;
In the world of digitalization, the online transactions, and the utilization of virtual currency is gradually increasing day by day. Since the origination of the world’s first virtual currency, i.e., Bitcoin in the year 2009, most of the countries are choosing virtual currency over real currency for making their financial transactions. A secured and bug-free exchange development is much needed for the virtual transactions to stop the fraudulent activities across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-features-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key features of cryptocurrency exchange development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create a cryptocurrency exchange development, you need to carefully consider its intended functionality. While the number and the list of features vary according to the type of exchange you build, several core features form the basis of all cryptocurrency exchanges. &lt;br&gt;
By way of an example, let’s take a closer look at the standard user flow and the features needed: &lt;br&gt;
User:&lt;br&gt;
• Registers in the crypto exchange system and indicates their cryptocurrencies of choice&lt;br&gt;
• Verifies account according to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards&lt;br&gt;
• Funds the account&lt;br&gt;
• Enters the value and volume of a cryptocurrency to be exchanged&lt;br&gt;
• Concludes a deal if there is already a counter-offer available on the site&lt;br&gt;
• Withdraws the funds to their credit card or to an in-app cryptocurrency wallet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the user flow, it’s clear that a cryptocurrency exchange development’s features should cover: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;User authorization and verification&lt;/strong&gt; – User authorization is the first step in onboarding, so provide a simple and easy process. Users do, however, expect other trading participants to be trustworthy and have good intentions, meaning verification is very important at this stage. Proper verification enables transactional transparency, reduces the risk of fraud, and shows that your cryptocurrency exchange adheres to international standards. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;User interface&lt;/strong&gt; – It's the face of your exchange platform, so make sure its design is simple, clear, and user-friendly. An intuitive interface ensures that transactions are executed efficiently, reducing trading time. The dashboard should provide quick access to features such as order management, order history, fund withdrawals and deposits, statistics, and so on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Trade engine&lt;/strong&gt; – The trade engine finds and connects traders. In addition, the trade engine’s quality greatly influences the speed and performance of the crypto exchange. The faster it is; the better service you provide to customers. Remember that users need real-time access to their trading data to effectively manage their investments. &lt;br&gt;
So, place a special focus on developing your trading engine. The integration of blockchain technology can be a solution here, not only is it a guarantee of total security and transparency but it also offers a way of speeding up your trading engine. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wallet&lt;/strong&gt; – Provide your users with e-wallets to store and transfer digital money. Providing two types of wallets (cold and hot) is a good idea. Hot wallets allow users to transfer money into their balance and withdraw it. Cold ones serve as a backup since they're not connected to the internet and are therefore protected from fraud.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Transaction history and order book&lt;/strong&gt; – An order book is a list of open orders that allows users to navigate the current bids. Transaction history enables users to track their activities. It's an overview of completed trades with transaction information such as the trade rate and time of the operation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Analytical tools&lt;/strong&gt; – A must if you want to build an advanced cryptocurrency app or website. Provide users with real-time data and additional information about market trends.  There is a whole list of indicators that help traders develop their game strategies: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Push notifications&lt;/strong&gt; – The best way to keep users updated on price changes, volatility, trends, news, and platform updates. Notifications can also help users track exchange listings. Just remember that users should be able to choose what notifications they wish to receive. Push notifications are easy, fast, and affordable to set up. Costs vary, but push notifications are cheaper than other automated marketing tools.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>How to extract email-address from a string?</title>
      <author>101samovar</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 06:05:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/101samovar/how-to-extract-email-address-from-a-string-2h7e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/101samovar/how-to-extract-email-address-from-a-string-2h7e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a string that contains email addresses. &lt;br&gt;
To get the email addresses we need the match method.&lt;br&gt;
The match method with a regular expression pattern for email addresses.&lt;br&gt;
This pattern suppose that the email address consists of login name, at-symbol and domain name.&lt;br&gt;
Login name can be combined from letters in lower and upper case, digits and underscore symbol.&lt;br&gt;
Domain name should consist of two parts separated with a dot symbol.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;manager: Smith@sm-domain.net; sales: Mak@sm-domain.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\w]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\w\-]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\.[\w]{2,}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we have got an array with email addresses from the string.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this article useful, if you need any help please let me know in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cryptocurrency Exchange Website Development</title>
      <author>andreapicoli</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 06:01:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/andreapicoli2/cryptocurrency-exchange-website-development-2g7n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/andreapicoli2/cryptocurrency-exchange-website-development-2g7n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we shared with you our opinion on how to start a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radindev.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-development/"&gt;cryptocurrency exchange website development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-cryptocurrency-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Cryptocurrency development?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency. Cryptocurrency uses blockchain, a secure, unalterable, decentralized ledger that keeps track of transactions. These transactions take place from peer to peer through blockchain with no intermediary, such as a bank, which allows them to take place efficiently&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a cryptocurrency exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crypto exchange is a platform on which you can buy and sell cryptocurrency. You can use exchanges to trade one crypto for another — converting Bitcoin to Litecoin, for example — or to buy crypto using regular currency, like the U.S. Dollar. Exchanges reflect current market prices of the cryptocurrencies they offer. You can also convert cryptocurrencies back into the U.S. Dollar or another currency on an exchange, to leave as cash within your account (if you want to trade back into crypto later) or withdraw to your regular bank account.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gzEMRyu1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ut6o4vlazbg7wpp9h03.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gzEMRyu1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ut6o4vlazbg7wpp9h03.png" alt="cryptocurrency exchange website development"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Cryptocurrency Exchange software development?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency transactions are verified on the Blockchain, paving way for a decentralized value exchange. A Cryptocurrency Exchange platform development allows buyers &amp;amp; sellers to exchange their coins with other coins or to further sell or buy the crypto currency with the market trends. &lt;br&gt;
Cryptocurrency is considered as future money. It leads to several companies and governments of different countries to invest in digital assets. Besides, it doesn't involve any third party. The software is responsible for the encryption of the digital currency. Due to the fame of bitcoins globally, various cryptocurrencies have entered the market. In fact, it is one of the most demanded forms of online investment in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency Exchange Software Development Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• High performance&lt;br&gt;
• Secure and reliable&lt;br&gt;
• Highly customizable&lt;br&gt;
• Cheaper and faster&lt;br&gt;
• Advanced control panel&lt;br&gt;
• Enhanced buy and sell system&lt;br&gt;
• Two factor authentication&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#classification-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Classification of cryptocurrency exchange software development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#centralized-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Centralized Crypto exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most common type of exchange. Such exchanges have a centralized operator who is responsible for security, updates, and functionality. Centralized exchanges manage order books, which record all buy and sell orders. The weak point of this type is that coins are stored in the services themselves, which increases the likelihood of losing your funds due to hacker attacks. Therefore, centralized exchanges work hard to ensure the proper level of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decentralized-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decentralized crypto exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralized exchanges provide transfers of funds directly between users' wallets. This reduces the potential for theft from exchange hacking since the exchange never actually stores cryptocurrency. However, you should keep in mind that in such exchanges, the lack of moderating third-party shifts all responsibility for errors and security to the users themselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#white-label-crypto-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  White label Crypto exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A customer saves up their time as the platform is ready-made. In fact, the characteristics and the work ability are already tested and used by various other traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#peertopeer-exchanges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Peer-to-peer exchanges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2P exchanges provide the sale and purchase of cryptocurrency directly between users. Traders leave their orders as on a bulletin board, and other network participants can respond to the offers and agree on the terms of buy/sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency-exchange-platform-development-provision"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency exchange platform development provision
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whitelabel-cryptocurrency-exchange-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Whitelabel cryptocurrency exchange services
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white label cryptocurrency exchange software is highly customizable and secured. At the same time, it allows customers to trade in top-notch currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ieo-integrated-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IEO integrated Exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the use of this platform, several projects can gather funds using the software’s database. The details of the investors are verified by the exchanges relieving traders from the hands of getting cheated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#onepage-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  One-page Exchange development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-page Exchange development eradicates tedious KYC authentication thereby making it easier for customers. The traders can strike a deal between numerous kinds of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dapp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dapp
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marketplace place is decentralized which means that no form of third parties would interfere while trading. Therefore, private details of traders are restored by the exchange. Users are verified before they are allowed in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency-wallet-development-amp-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency wallet development &amp;amp; integration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cryptocurrency currency can be well compared with a bank account. It lets you store your sum and also transact when required. To ensure safety a two-way authentication process is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blockchain-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blockchain development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain development lets customers trade sitting at the comfort of their own space. The cryptocurrency exchange software development can be accessed using phones as well as laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#smart-contract-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Smart Contract Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Contracts can be used by a trader endlessly. The entire process does not involve any form of a third party. This service lets a trader hire a smart developer whose task is to help traders find a suitable business contract for the progression of firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency-exchange-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency Exchange Security
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service includes encryption of data which helps secure transacted data and personal details of a customer. When a customer fails in their attempt to log in several times then they remain blocked for a particular period of time from using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mobile-app-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mobile App exchange development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service includes encryption of data so that private details about a trader is not revealed to anyone. Apart from this, customers are able to trade sitting anywhere and anytime. The app is made user-friendly, it is suitable for Apple and Android users.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dSmFof1c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4829n9b9dg6j26c0hp5t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dSmFof1c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4829n9b9dg6j26c0hp5t.png" alt="Steps to building a cryptocurrency exchange website development"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#steps-to-building-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-website-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Steps to building a cryptocurrency exchange website development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-know-the-competitors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1. know the competitors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and essential step to build your own bitcoin exchange website is to have thorough research about the competitors. For every kind of website creation, it is excellent to check out the existing website providing the bitcoin exchange.&lt;br&gt;
For every business startup, knowing your competitor is the first and most crucial step. So, to start a Bitcoin exchange website, it will be great to do some research on existing Bitcoin websites and know their rating and reviews on google.&lt;br&gt;
As they are the competitors of your website and researching them will provide you with an essential strategy to create a bitcoin exchange website. It is best to narrow down all the competitors to have plenty of ideas to create a website in the best possible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-decide-business-operation-limits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2. Decide business operation limits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to find the area where you will provide bitcoin exchanges as bitcoin exchanges can vary from place to place, country to country or across the globe. Thus, when you build your own bitcoin exchange website, decide where it will be operated. This is also important as some countries do not allow bitcoin exchanges, and some have strict rules and regulations.&lt;br&gt;
When you are starting a website, you need to check out everything globally and provide accordingly. If you fail or miss this step, you are likely to end up with problems in the end. For this, you must check your peers and areas where their website operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-detect-your-goal-market"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3. Detect your goal market
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another step to make your bitcoin website exchange a success. Knowing the target audience before starting a website is a must to create content according to the audience you target. Like, bitcoin exchanges are not for kids or people who do not deal with bitcoin exchanges. It is for the people who work in bitcoin and want to invest in it. Know about the target audience and determine the success of your site in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-make-an-expert-site"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4. Make an expert site
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have decided the area, audience, and competition to build your own bitcoin exchange website, the next step is to create the website, which is an important segment. It is a must for you to create a website that is eye-catchy and alluring to your audience. Make sure the functionality and security of the website are high. Here are some core segments that you need to consider to build your own bitcoin website exchange. Maintain high speed for page loading and transactions happening on your website. People could get frustrated because of delays in any of the above two tasks. So, this is another criterion to pay attention to when you are creating your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-distribution-channel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5. Distribution Channel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining on the data distribution channel for your website is yet another essential step. Because choosing the accurate communication type will attract the customers more. There are two channels — Synchronous and Asynchronous distributed systems; you can select the best one depending on the need of your website:&lt;br&gt;
• Synchronous method&lt;br&gt;
Synchronous communication happens when you have devised specific technology like API, etc., to remain in contact with your customers in real-time.&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, in the synchronous method, there is no gap between the data.&lt;br&gt;
• Asynchronous method&lt;br&gt;
Connecting with your customers by email messages. Here the provider and the customer are both not expected to be in constant contact. As a result, there is a gap between message delivery and receiving time, each computer connected with the other processes the information independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-6-coding-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6. Coding method
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency, many people try to copy it. However, don’t forget that building a Bitcoin exchange website isn’t enough for your original cryptocurrency website. Except when you are going with the classic Bitcoin exchange website. Coding assembles all your ideas in one place. It holds them together. So, keep your mind open while selecting the software type for your website, as there are three broad types to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White label software
White label software is another popular choice. And that too for a very valid reason— they are pre-existing sets but can also be customized to suit your needs. This way, it takes less development time and can be modified a little. 
However, not all white label software offers that much coding freedom. They use the SaaS service model and are generally used on a rent or subscription basis. They are considered much more secure than open-source software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use current open-source software.
Open-source software is readily available on platforms such as GitHub etc. There is pre-prepared open source software for online cryptocurrency exchange websites. And in huge numbers for a Bitcoin exchange website. Until and unless you have a unique idea that needs all newly built software. Go with the pre-existing software. These are free of cost and also save a lot of development time.  If you don’t want to utilize your money for the whole software development process, this is the most cost-efficient method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built an Internal software
For this, you have to conjure up a large development team. Also, this is the most expensive method out of the three. It takes almost a year-round to complete all the coding, testing, etc. This is, though, as much beneficial as costly. 
As a result, a whole online cryptocurrency exchange software development right from scratch will give you an upper hand. Moreover, you can take time to closely observe and improve the back-end and the front-end coding, etc.
### Step 7. Payment processing
Finding a bank or any other payment processor is not an easy task. Many banking institutions are skeptical of any cryptocurrency. Therefore, you need to start your payment processor-hunting a tad bit earlier. 
Most importantly, do not open a personal bank account. That could get shut down immediately because the bit transactions require immediate transactions of high amounts. This will not work if you open a personal account with a bank. So, the frequency and speed of transactions are two essential factors to consider while choosing a bank.
As a result, choose the favorable bank or any other payment processing system like the cryptocurrency payment apps. If you are selling goods or services and want to use your cryptocurrency for that purpose, many such payment apps are available online.

### Step 8. Launch the marketing plan
Now that everything is set. The software has been developed. Launching a website should also be strategized. Prepare a well-set plan to promote and market your presence. Creating an inside network is the first step. Next, think of outside promotions. So many currently working online cryptocurrency exchange websites use digital marketing as the best source of attracting potential customers.
## How does Cryptocurrency Exchange software development works?
Just as cryptocurrency is based on blockchain technology, the cryptocurrency exchange software or platform is also based on blockchain technology. The heart of cryptocurrency exchange software is its trading engine. It matches buyer and seller orders, executes transactions, and calculates balances.
## Build the best cryptocurrency exchange website architecture
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M3wZLCKD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6aj2cahhwm93fza0nfn.png" alt="build cryptocurrency exchange website"&gt;
### A basic architecture solution for the cryptocurrency exchange website will include the four necessary steps:
• Trading engine. Without this core part, the whole mechanism cannot work. A trading engine should have unhindered access to the order book, match all the purchasing and selling orders, process transactions and calculate balances.
• Frontend. Your UI ought to be fully configured for quick and smooth trading and transaction processes. Try to make it intuitive and user-friendly for your clients to find their accounts, see all the significant changes of the exchange rates as soon as possible, deposit crypto or fiat money, and place any orders.
• The wallet. The electronic wallets for the digital currencies you provide on your website should enable a very quick and easy launching, yet secure operations of withdrawal of your virtual money and converting them to the fiat currency.
• Admin panel. This powerful dashboard is ought to help the administrator run the trading operations as well as verifying processes, create liquidity, and provide helpful and professional customer support.
### Ensure the corresponding level of security
Digital money is all about being truly protected and secure. We would advise you to commit to that principle, as it was estimated that almost half of all the cryptocurrency exchange businesses have closed because of being hacked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your website is an absolutely safe base for all the transactions, ICO, and money withdrawals that you will hold. The same must be applied to your clients’ sensitive personal information, as it must be protected much severely these days than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pay-attention-to-the-software"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pay attention to the software
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s technological market is fully ready for adventurous entrepreneurs aspiring to launch their own digital currency exchange startups. That is why it may offer you a starting software package. Such websites as BTC Trader or Alphapoint can offer you a ready-made exchange solution.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from a web exchange solution, be sure do not forget about the additional mobile app development, as it may increase your revenues significantly. However, it may be a good idea to resort to the customized software pack you prefer for creating a convenient brand new exchange facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#take-care-of-transparency-amp-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Take care of transparency &amp;amp; security
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically all services operating with currencies should adhere to the Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, which imply checking passport or some other ID data in order to confirm the client personality. The main goal of following such policies is to exclude scamming possibilities in the exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#think-about-cryptocurrency-choice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Think about cryptocurrency choice
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any exchange website must support as many significant crypto and fiat currencies as possible. In such a way the developers ensure a broader client audience and quick international expansion.&lt;br&gt;
However, a necessary manual integration of every currency you support may become a challenge, that is why it would be impossible to launch an exchange service with numerous digital currencies. So you will need to run profound research to analyze your target market and see what currencies would be the best choice for your startup. Apart from popular Bitcoin and Ethereum, you should also take into regard Litecoin, Ripple, and some others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#provide-liquidity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Provide liquidity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment of launching your exchange business, you should artificially model demand for your service. You can do that in two ways:&lt;br&gt;
establish activity by buying and selling crypto using profiles you also manually create;&lt;br&gt;
connect to the network of other exchanges to acquire liquidity of all services that are already connected to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#organize-good-customer-support"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Organize good customer support
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the launch of the platform, you should hire at least a couple of employees that would take care of support. It’s crucial to provide utter accessibility of the support services – i.e., the support employees should react fast and help with the required competency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-much-does-it-cost-to-create-your-exchange-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How much does it cost to create your exchange website?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding various challenges that you need to overcome while building your own cryptocurrency exchange facilities, it cannot but be a costly process. However, with a smart attitude and much of entrepreneurial spirit, you will be able to launch your startup with a very reasonable pricing policy.&lt;br&gt;
Regardless of your choice of software, your perfect team should include project manager (unless you don’t want to take this position by your own), platform developer, QA engineer, experienced web designer, and a UI developer. The cost of their services will vary significantly depending on several factors. The most important here is probably your team’s country of location.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use React Router Dom as Pro</title>
      <author>Akash Gupta</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 05:27:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/akash_gupta/how-to-use-react-router-dom-as-pro-2bi4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/akash_gupta/how-to-use-react-router-dom-as-pro-2bi4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routing&lt;/strong&gt; is super important part of any &lt;strong&gt;SPA&lt;/strong&gt;, without it you can’t navigate to another page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#are-you-really-managing-it-in-a-best-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Are you really managing it in a Best way?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose, &lt;strong&gt;we have more than 100 pages in React&lt;/strong&gt; and have routing of each pages and &lt;strong&gt;one page may have linked to another page&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;we will write something like this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lGWTPVhi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2472/1%2AtF0lFkLDSmfPXTAsIDn3qg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lGWTPVhi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2472/1%2AtF0lFkLDSmfPXTAsIDn3qg.png" alt="React Bad Routing Style"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and have linking like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vMKIL_cR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2188/1%2A-Q10uC0tX7BIyntXY8e8sg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vMKIL_cR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2188/1%2A-Q10uC0tX7BIyntXY8e8sg.png" alt="React Bad linking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if we are managing it like above so the project code will gonna lose its cleanliness and richness very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-whats-the-best-way-to-manage-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what’s the best way to manage it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Define all Routes inside *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;routing/AppRoutes.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2eXDge_L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2Akyc1GyyUQPF7pdu8ljaX6g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2eXDge_L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2Akyc1GyyUQPF7pdu8ljaX6g.png" alt="*AppRoutes*.ts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use **AppRoutes **like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X8DHYaX5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2364/1%2AXUhEVGJXGr9DmTaOU6ftvg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X8DHYaX5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2364/1%2AXUhEVGJXGr9DmTaOU6ftvg.png" alt="Good Routing Style"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;To make it more global and readable, create *&lt;/em&gt;*routing/*useAppRoutes.ts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YXfFc2HQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2096/1%2AugH_rzK0M3BNMKhkU2kJNw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YXfFc2HQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2096/1%2AugH_rzK0M3BNMKhkU2kJNw.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now we need pass Param &lt;strong&gt;taskId&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;TASK_DETAIL. **there can be easier way like this below but **i will not recommend it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tljpDW-N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2372/1%2Ayo5jfqhBXAka4B0opDZGpQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tljpDW-N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2372/1%2Ayo5jfqhBXAka4B0opDZGpQ.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-make-it-more-cleaner-by-overriding-usehistory-hook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let’s make it more cleaner by overriding useHistory hook
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;npm i urlcat — save&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;routing*/useMyHistory.ts*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fl-8qf3R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2792/1%2AetrWIdOgQ2TuM6S72YKwRg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fl-8qf3R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2792/1%2AetrWIdOgQ2TuM6S72YKwRg.png" alt="useMyHistory.ts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finally-we-made-it-now-its-time-to-use-it-on-our-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finally we made it now it’s time to use it on our code.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goto routing/&lt;em&gt;useAppRoutes.ts *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;replace useHistory with useMyHistory&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1GwMlbUB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2076/1%2AaXGO3GKzYGwiwOniIfZ_mQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1GwMlbUB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2076/1%2AaXGO3GKzYGwiwOniIfZ_mQ.png" alt="replacement of useHistory with useMyHistory"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Page Look Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pd5_at83--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2144/1%2AQi0PeL8PBGw5lnQHkOkffA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pd5_at83--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2144/1%2AQi0PeL8PBGw5lnQHkOkffA.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="https://github.com/akash-gupt/akash-superspace/tree/main/apps/react-routing-example"&gt;**Git Example&lt;/a&gt; .**&lt;/p&gt;
