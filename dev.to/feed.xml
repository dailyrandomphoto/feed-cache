      <guid>https://dev.to/myogeshchavan97/how-to-easily-add-google-map-to-your-webpage-2jce</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On most of the company websites, you will find locations or contacts page that displays that company location in that country or state in a google map along with the company address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty common requirement even for food or hotel business-related websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this article, we will see how to add a google map with the preferred location on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new folder with the name &lt;code&gt;google-map-location-demo&lt;/code&gt; and create an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file inside it. Now, type ! (exclamation mark) in the file and press tab, so the default HTML code will automatically be added by emmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not aware of emmet and its useful shortcuts, check out my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/myogeshchavan97/speed-up-your-coding-using-emmet-a-really-powerful-tool-46nj"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--luLglQcx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633691524400/HIU4-_tKi.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--luLglQcx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633691524400/HIU4-_tKi.gif" alt="emmet_trick.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change the title tag content as per your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#displaying-google-map-location-on-webpage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Displaying Google Map Location on Webpage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this demo, we will show the Eiffel tower's location on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So follow the below steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/"&gt;https://maps.google.com/&lt;/a&gt; and search for Eiffel Tower in the search box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, click on the &lt;code&gt;Share&lt;/code&gt; icon and select the &lt;code&gt;Embed a map&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;COPY HTML&lt;/code&gt; button to copy the iframe tag into your clipboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, open the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, and inside the body tag, add the copied content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zX1MpSib--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633699007746/uxFcrQaMB.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zX1MpSib--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633699007746/uxFcrQaMB.gif" alt="embed_map.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, If you open the file in the browser, you will see the map displayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ep1knzHV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633699354689/FKFZmwUDO.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ep1knzHV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633699354689/FKFZmwUDO.gif" alt="open_live.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Experience Working with Remote Repos</title>
      <author>dbelokon</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 05:10:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/belokond/experience-working-with-remote-repos-7ie</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/belokond/experience-working-with-remote-repos-7ie</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was contributing to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/dodo-SSG"&gt;dodo-ssg's&lt;/a&gt; remote repo. My intention was to add a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/dodo-SSG/tree/issue-15"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; so that when someone types in "--config" or "-c" followed by a path to a JSON file, the program will read its contents and execute the commands inside of it. This is a useful feature when you don't want to see a super long line in the command line interface filled with a bunch of commands. Here is my &lt;a href="https://github.com/menghif/dodo-SSG/pull/16"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I decided to implement this feature was that I checked whether the user passed the config flag and if they did, I would try to open and parse the JSON configuration file. After this, I extracted the accepted properties from the JSON, overwriting any arguments that the user might have passed before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-torturings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some Torturings
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started working on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/dodo-SSG"&gt;dodo-ssg&lt;/a&gt;, I felt like my brain was melting. I think that it had to do with the fact that in the last couple of months, I have been mostly working with C#, Python, and a bit of Java, which have a completely different feel compared to JavaScript. It took me a while until everything clicked in 💡.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was looking at a variable named "fs" and it took me a while to unfreeze and figure out that that was to store a file system😳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I remembered that when checking if a variable is of type string, we have to also check whether is it is an instance of a String object, because &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9436948"&gt;JavaScript is weird&lt;/a&gt;🙈.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git It
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I got to learn some more commands to work with Git. &lt;br&gt;
Here is what I am adding to my collection this time😋: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track a remote repo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git remote add remote-repo-name remote-repo-url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get commits and branches from the remote repo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git fetch remote-repo-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch to a branch from the remote repo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git checkout remote-repo-name/branch-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merge a branch from a remote repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout local-branch # switch to local branch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git merge remote-repo-name/branch-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-to-do-when-you-committed-to-the-wrong-branch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What to do when you committed to the wrong branch? 💡
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working  on the project, I had a little "committing to the wrong branch" situation. I couldn't figure out how to "uncommit" from the wrong branch and then commit to the proper branch. If you ever find yourself being tortured with this like I did, here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move the main branch to its previous commit (before your wrong commit):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD^&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a branch that you want to commit to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git branch issue-15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move the branches location to the commit that dealt with fix&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git reset ac8bdfb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, here, we are just replacing the "wrong" branch with the "correct" branch so our commit appears in the branch we intended it to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mindset-and-motivation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mindset and Motivation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it took me a while to actually sit down and start working on this contribution(🐌!!) because I didn't know what solution to come up with. I learned that it is better to start working on the problem as soon as possible even if it just means setting everything up for the project or coding the first step of a solution. Because the more you think, the more fears come into your mind and it just becomes harder and harder to get started. In reality, most of the time it is easier than you think😅.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time, I will start working on a problem as soon as I can, even if I am scared because I can't think of any solution. 🦾&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Python- Intermediate course: Day 40, Summary of the week and more about OOP</title>
      <author>Aatmaj</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 04:31:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-40-summary-of-the-week-and-more-about-oop-5gap</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-40-summary-of-the-week-and-more-about-oop-5gap</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today-let-us-summarize-the-week-and-check-out-a-more-about-oop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today let us summarize the week and check out a more about OOP
&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Let us first check out a program which shows the implementation of Complex numbers through classes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Complex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Default values
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Complex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Complex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;3.605551275463989
6.4031242374328485

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above program, a and b are different objects of the same class. Which means that they have different values of attributes. Object is representative of class. Consider it like this - class is a common noun while the object is a proper noun. Classes are like templated for molding objects.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why OOP?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In software development lifecycle, coding is fifth or sixth stage. First analysis of requirements of clients is done. Developers approach client and get technical review of the requirement, discuss at length with client. Unless we get clarity as what and how is expected coding doesnt start. Then feasibility test is done. budget-wise. then prototype is given to client step by step. Changes are noted. &lt;br&gt;
In this whole process, the use of OOP is beneficial. Maintaining, updating and carry forward existing versions to next version can be done easily using OOP. Code flexibility is enhanced. We can make changes to the project without much changes in code using OOP. Also, extension of code becomes very easy. We can add new features without much changes to the old ones. This is why in a popular language like Python, learning about OOP is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-of-the-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary of the week.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-37"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-37-file-handling-in-python-1pih"&gt;Day 37&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learnt about file handling in Python. &lt;br&gt;
We can open a file into four modes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"r" Reading mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"w" Writing mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"a" Appending mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"r+" Both reading and writing
If not passed, then Python will assume it to be “ r ” by default. &lt;code&gt;file = open("myfile.txt", "r")&lt;/code&gt; Opens the file. We can read the contents of the file using the &lt;code&gt;file.read()&lt;/code&gt; method. We can write into a file using the &lt;code&gt;file.write("\n")&lt;/code&gt; method. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-38"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-38-oop-197"&gt;Day 38&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learnt about making classes in Python. Classes are object blueprints. Classes are generated using the syntax&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def functionname (classname,......arguments......):
 ...
 ...
 ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the class methods, the class parameter (&lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;) is a must. Private methods can be made by writing two underscores before the class name. Private methods cannot be accessed from outside the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-39"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructors in Python can be created using the &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; keyword. A constructor is a special type of member function of a class which initializes objects of a class. The constructor is run when the class is instantiated. The class constructors can be called by other parts of the class or even outside pf the class. If we do not provide a constructor to the class, Python generates one default constructor automatically. We can even pass parameters to the constructors.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So friends that was all for today! &lt;br&gt;
Next week plan-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadly triangle of death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. In this article I will focus on what the best way is, in my opinion, to handle “components cascade” in React. Using this approach, your application will be well organized and you’ll make it more readable and easier to maintain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppRoutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/components/AppRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/store/store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/styles/theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@chakra-ui/react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClientProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-redux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;defaultOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;queries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;cacheTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;retry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;refetchInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;refetchOnMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;refetchOnReconnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;refetchOnWindowFocus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;QueryClientProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AppRoutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;QueryClientProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ChakraProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looks like hell, doesn't it? But imagine that you have even more providers, or these providers have many properties that you need to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what is the problem? I have some points here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t use the &lt;code&gt;useLocation()&lt;/code&gt; hook in the App component, because you’re including the &lt;code&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/code&gt; on the same component, so you can only use the hook in a child component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may face some conflicts when importing multiple providers from many libraries (or even your own code). So you will need to rename &lt;code&gt;import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from 'react-redux’&lt;/code&gt; for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you want to remove a provider, your commit will have many changed lines in your code, because your editor will reindent all child components at least 1 column to the left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could point out other problems here, but I think that’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a technique in React for reusing component logic. It’s called high-order component (the HOC). It’s basically a function what will wrap your component with any other component that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-generic-type-for-hocs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a generic type for HOCs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we are looking to make reusable components, we need to create a type definition for our HOCs (only if you’re using Typescript):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactHoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;): React.FC&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t panic! Let me explain what is happening here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 1:&lt;/strong&gt; we are declaring the interface &lt;code&gt;ReactHoc&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; declares that we will receive some param of type &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; (any type) - this is because we don’t know what property the React component will have;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt; we are receiving a param &lt;code&gt;WrappedComponent&lt;/code&gt; that has the type &lt;code&gt;React.ComponentType&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a React Component with the &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; params.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;React.FC&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; we are returning a new React functional component with the same params as our &lt;code&gt;WrappedComponent&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s a little difficult, but you will get used to working with Typescript typing. If you don't understand that now, you will later, don’t worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-your-first-hoc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create your first HOC
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the easy part! Let’s create our React Redux HOC:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/store/store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactHoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/types/hocs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-redux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withRedux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactHoc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withRedux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 6:&lt;/strong&gt; we are declaring the function name. It will have the type of the &lt;code&gt;ReactHoc&lt;/code&gt;, a function that will receive a component and will return another React component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 8:&lt;/strong&gt; we add the Redux provider, as we did before;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Line 9:&lt;/strong&gt; now we need to render the component we want to wrap, passing all parameters to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to create other HOCs for the other providers: &lt;code&gt;withChakraUi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;withReactQuery&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;withReactRouter&lt;/code&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the end, you will need to compose your app with all that HOCs. For that, I like to use the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/recompose"&gt;Recompose&lt;/a&gt; library. It has other powerful uses, but for now we will use only the &lt;code&gt;compose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppRoutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/components/AppRoutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withChakraUI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/hocs/with-chakra-ui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withReactQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/hocs/with-react-query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withReactRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/hocs/with-react-router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withReactSuspense&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/hocs/with-react-suspense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withRedux&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/hocs/with-redux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;recompose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AppRoutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;compose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withChakraUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withReactSuspense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withReactRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withReactQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;withRedux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your App component is now clean and beautiful! If you need to remove the redux, you just need to remove the &lt;code&gt;withRedux&lt;/code&gt; and it’s done! One line in your commit (actually two, as you will need to remove the import line 😁)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make good use of what you have just learned and leave your comment or question below. And if you liked, please like and share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hacktoberfest's first commit</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/tuenguyen2911_67/hacktoberfest-s-first-commit-1oak</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A complicated software or application takes lots of effort to build and it takes extra effort to maintain. That is why developers utilize GitHub to make their source code open to the public, so that others can fix bugs, add features to their applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course, I've been using GitHub with other students to somehow simulate the open-source processes. However, with Hacktoberfest, it's the perfect opportunity to contribute to real projects and participate in the event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#looking-for-good-issues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Looking for good issues
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After filtering the search results with the label &lt;code&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/code&gt;, there were more than 50,000 issues open, but finding a perfect is not an easy task. I've come across a lot of issues which were out of my knowledge or issues that people created for the sake of Hacktoberfest which were not worth spending time on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally chose a few interesting repos and issues that I liked. My 2 pull requests this week got merged and I felt very happy about it. Since &lt;a href="https://github.com/fawazahmed0/youtube-uploader/pull/46"&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt; got accepted first, I will talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-pr-merged"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First PR merged
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked and got assigned &lt;a href="https://github.com/fawazahmed0/youtube-uploader/issues/45"&gt;the issue&lt;/a&gt; to add better error messages from a npm package &lt;code&gt;youtube-uploader&lt;/code&gt;. At first, the script looked a bit complicated, most error messages were quite clear and I was also working on another issue, I asked the owner to drop my assignment but he insisted me to look over it again. Taken aback by his generosity, I opened the text editor and tried to understand the code to improve error messages. Eventually, I understood the script, found a few debug messages to clarify and an hour a later, a Pull Request was up and waiting to be reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the improvements that I did&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitForSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;avatarButtonSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Avatar/Profile picture button not found : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//... &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitForSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;langMenuItemSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Language menu item selector/button("&amp;gt;") not found : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-have-i-learned"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What have I learned?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some lessons that I've drawn: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to filter the issues that you like &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be patient when installing and reading the the others' code &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for help by reaching out to the author in GitHub, Discord,...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Divtober Day 9: Homonym</title>
      <author>Alvaro Montoro</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 02:39:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/divtober-day-9-homonym-mhh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/divtober-day-9-homonym-mhh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I won't be able to use the computer tomorrow, so I decided to go ahead and build the divtober drawing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word of the day is "homonym", which was an interesting challenge. Two words are homonyms if they are written the same but have different meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I drew an animated paper boat sinking in a bathroom sink:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/embed/porzXrO?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the paper boat sinks in the sink, you will need to rerun the animation to see it again (it doesn't loop). The water drop does loop though... but only on Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About lab 4...</title>
      <author>jsong89</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:29:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/about-lab-4-1521</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/about-lab-4-1521</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#begin-with"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Begin with..
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lab 4 is a new device to be added to ssg. Instead of entering and executing a command for each desired function, if you enter &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--config&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; file, the It should be executed based on the command and the value of the command, and I was assigned a requirement to work in the ssg of another student, not my ssg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#working-with-who"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Working with who..
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I already felt tired of entering each command separately every time I run ssg, and personally I was thinking similar to lab4, so I really liked this requirement and felt good. Unfortunately, it was a collaboration with a student other than my code, so while I was looking for a suitable collaborator, a student named Hung Nguyen wanted to collaborate with me, so I decided to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Started..
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hung Nguyen's code was similar to mine in many ways, so it was fortunately very easy to work with. However, personally, I think he would have been able to manage ssg more conveniently and efficiently if he divided the file into 2 or 3 parts instead of putting everything in one JavaScript file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-i-did"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What I did..
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first touch on his code was to update yargs so that the api recognizes the config options.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.option("config", {
        alias: "c",
        desc: "Add an option flag to indicates the config for replacing using command line argument. e.g: --config ./ssg-config.json means using ./ssg-config.json's values for command line argument."
    })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, when &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--config&lt;/code&gt; is entered on the command line, the authentication process and the value in &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; after authentication are assigned to the required command line input value of each function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let fileOrDir;
let outputDir;
let lang;
let css;
if(command.c || command.config){
    //check if the file is json
    if(!command.c.endsWith("json") || !command.config.endsWith("json")){
        return console.log("Sorry your input file is not json type.")
    }
    const jsonData = require(`../${command.c}`);
    console.log(jsonData);
    fileOrDir = jsonData.input;
    outputDir = (jsonData.output &amp;amp;&amp;amp; jsonData.output.replace('./', '')) ?? 'dist';
    lang = jsonData.lang;
    css = jsonData.styleSheet;
    //ignore all options
    if(!fileOrDir){
        console.log('Please provide -c or -i options');
    }
}else {
    fileOrDir = takeFile();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After completing minor modifications, Hung's ssg has successfully recognized config.json.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pullrequest-and-small-trouble"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pullrequest and small trouble...
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When everything was finished and I finally proceeded to the pull request, something embarrassing happened. One of the students requested a pull request that added the config function to Hung's ssg arbitrarily, even though I showed that I was collaborating with the friend by making an issue first without any understanding or question. This was very rude and rude behavior that went without discussion (I think so) and I immediately reported the matter to Hung and fortunately he got my pull request. Personally, I don't want someone to be rude like that and it's not common in the development industry. Because his indifference behavior can be an act of trampling on other people's time and effort.&lt;br&gt;
( -᷅_-᷄)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-after-that"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And after that
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everything was resolved, I also received a pull request from Hung, and after checking the integrity of the code, I successfully merged it. His code also worked well and I'm happy with it. The pre-merger collision test proposed in lab4 is new, so it is a little slow to learn, and it seems it will take some time to get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#as-a-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  As a result
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this lab4 I had a nice experience again with the collaborator, which also improved my eyes to see the other's code. However, the issue that someone tried to interrupt my code is really not a fun experience. I hope will not have the same situation twice... (-`д´-)&lt;/p&gt;
