      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we live in a world where online purchases are so common that the first sale via the Internet in 1995 — a book sold on the Amazon website — has become no more than history. The "revolutionary" format of online commerce has redressed customers in pajamas: 40% of purchases in e-shops occur between 10 pm and 10 am. But what's the new point of e-commerce? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article aims at showing you the latest trends in retail driven by technology. Let's create a picture of its possible future together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#retail-of-today-and-tomorrow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Retail of Today and Tomorrow
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the worldwide coronavirus outbreak in 2019, we saw that the consumer behavior model changed significantly. The share of people buying products online has dramatically increased. What's more, it is predicted to remain at the same level or even continue to grow. Why? Because for now, many people won’t want to waste time visiting crowded retail outlets. Furthermore, online purchases have become a kind of routine habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a cursory glance at the performance indicators of retail chains shows that companies that fine-tuned the processes of online commerce and related logistics before the beginning of the self-isolation regime are in a more advantageous position during the pandemic. In contrast, businesses where these processes don't work, have faced the last warning, the "yellow card."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does this mean that companies who have adopted online orders can feel confident about the future and those with undeveloped online trading will be excluded from the competition? The answer is that each needs to reconsider their strategies following the 2021 requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is shaping the future of retail? Here are the main challenges for retailers to address in 2021 and beyond. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_A73IxK---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/24bav6wf95p6jmo3g6vm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_A73IxK---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/24bav6wf95p6jmo3g6vm.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 120634"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;High health &amp;amp; safety standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has affected the number of store visits because people avoid crowded places, so retailers relying on the brick-and-mortar model need to find their solution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceleration of digital transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because more and more purchases take place on the internet, digital transformation has become a key priority for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance of customer loyalty and engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thought here is that customer loyalty in offline shops does not transfer to those online, so the provision of a seamless digital experience is a must. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics capacity management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the talk is about digital or offline orders, a rise or drop in them, retailers need to ensure that their systems are prepared for the scale of logistics capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assimilation with new customer habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one of many habits e-commerce retailers need to adjust to is that most orders today are made at night. So there’s an increased demand for 24-hour support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how to address these issues? What solutions are offered by the world of technology and how can retailers take advantage of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#technology-trends-to-reshape-the-future-of-retail-industry-in-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Technology Trends to Reshape the Future of Retail Industry in 2021
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was a highly transformational year for retail. As stores closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, most of the retailers were forced to implement a digital-first approach. Still, there is space for the older brick-and-mortar shops, yet the one that needs some sort of transformation. So here are the key technology trends of 2021 that help retailers to adapt to the changing situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click &amp;amp; Collect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This model of shopping allows buying products online to later pick them up in a store. While it's not new, the popularity of click &amp;amp; collect has skyrocketed due to the coronavirus outbreak, allowing customers to spend minimum time in a shop while buying everything they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of click &amp;amp; collect include speed, convenience, and low cost — everything clients greatly appreciate. For this reason, 2020 saw a 60,4 % Click &amp;amp; Collect Retail sales growth in the U.S. The model was implemented by such world-known market players as IKEA, Nike, Walmart, and Zara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR in Shopping Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gwyw5ESH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qgh9kyi202fd099vdxsz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gwyw5ESH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qgh9kyi202fd099vdxsz.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 120705"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Global Market Insights report states that the Augmented Reality (AR) market value will reach $50 billion by 2024, showing a 75% growth rate annually. And there's actually no surprise. AR has already taken its niche in automotive and healthcare, so its wide adoption by retailers is just a matter of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even today we can see a wide range of AR-powered technologies used by retailers. Among the major contributors to the speedy adoption of the technology are AR kits from Google and iOS that make the technology more accessible than ever before. So we can confidently say that over the coming years, AR will pave its way to smaller retail businesses to change the game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how exactly does AR help retailers to reach a new level of doing business? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, it can be used to help shoppers find certain products and shelves in the store, as well as check out their price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, it opens up space for in-store virtual product fitting. Such brands as Mango and Neiman Marcus have already implemented AR into their stores in the form of “intelligent mirrors.” One more case is represented by the Louis Vuitton brand that creates virtual product exhibitions on social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing users to try on clothes without a need to go to the crowded shops and touching things that an infected person might have touched before. AR helps retailers to address the issues of health &amp;amp; safety standards. Also, it contributes to the increase in customer loyalty and engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer-Centered Retail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Research completed by Shekel Brainweigh Ltd states that 87% of customers choose shops with contactless or self-check-out options. What does this mean for businesses? They need to hear their customers and, as an option, implement solutions like mobile cashiers or scanners that allow making fast and easy in-store payments with a phone. It works as follows: after the item gets scanned, the purchase needs to be finalized in a mobile app. It allows making the whole purchasing process contactless: customers can avoid queues, so levels of safety and satisfaction increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best real-world examples of such technology is represented by Amazon’s Just Walk Out Technology. It allows visitors of the store to take items they need, scan them with the mobile app, pay in the app, and leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Amazon is not the only business that has leveraged such an approach. Grocery giant 7-Eleven is also on the list of providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Robot Assistants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F-LZ-Mip--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dxsozwjud3gjickw69k3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F-LZ-Mip--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dxsozwjud3gjickw69k3.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 120730"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Robots in retail are not new. Yet, they are expected to take a wider niche in the industry, become more autonomous, smart, service-oriented, and sophisticated. Tasks that can be transferred to robots can go beyond answering questions of customers, also covering inventory and warehouse issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, they can address certain issues related to logistics capacity management to allow retailers to be better prepared to predict demand, lower product waste, and increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to in-store use cases, retailers can leverage voice-activated robots like Temi. In addition to helping visitors with finding products and information about them, they can also redeem promotions and finalize purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning and Big Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One more trend that contributes to better logistics management and operation is represented by the combination of Big Data and Machine Learning. Together, they also allow retailers to find new innovative ways to optimize customer-supplier relationship management and create smarter, more effective marketing campaigns. One more useful outcome is advanced analytics that boosts the accuracy of forecasts and minimizes the possibility of overstocking, in this way saving companies money they would usually spend on warehousing and logistics issues.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#our-expertise-in-the-development-of-solutions-for-retailers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Our Expertise in the Development of Solutions for Retailers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Emerline, we are closely watching all the retail trends to provide our clients with top-notch solutions that make a difference and allow them to maintain a strong position in the constantly changing and highly competitive market. Some of the projects under investigation we are ready to offer now are briefly described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grocery Store Mobile App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WcN1VIB7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aizokrw19wpzmzyg6hwh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WcN1VIB7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aizokrw19wpzmzyg6hwh.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 120758"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A custom app that allows getting all information about goods in store (price, manufacturer, distributor, composition, shelf life, promotions, etc.) via QR code scanning. The solution not only allows for online payments but is also integrated with the store loyalty programs/discount cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrations with other retail systems used within the company ensure effective tracking of all information about customers, allowing increased engagement and loyalty to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We create an application with the possibility of QR code scanning and establish the integrations with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit/credit cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A customer can scan QR codes on products via the app and get all important information about them. If they want to buy a product, they click "add" and the product goes to the online shopping cart of the app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After collecting all products, a customer goes to the mobile checkout terminal where, independently or with the help of a merchant, checks all goods and makes an online payment in the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Afterwards, they receive an online receipt in their app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to severe competition between retail stores, more and more brands are opting for tech-driven solutions that would help them to continuously make fast, safe, and eco-friendly sales. Take advantage of a mixed shopping model (online and offline) to create the ultimate experience that increases sales by making a customer journey more satisfying and allowing your business to become eco-friendly through getting rid of paper receipts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI for Personalized Shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cvc7poy9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0nek4xgch34pac45hjdf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cvc7poy9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0nek4xgch34pac45hjdf.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 120834"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The development of the solution is based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies that allow for the delivery of advanced analytics on customer behavior. The solution contributes to the more personalized provision of services, regardless of whether the purchase takes place on the website or off. This means that you’re hitting your customers with the correct message at the right time and place, in this way increasing sales potential. Thanks to advanced analytics, you get an intimate understanding of changing consumer behaviors, wants, needs, and shopping patterns, as well as impacts of social, geographic, economic, and political factors. You can use the data for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product categorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized addressing with welcome texts or product offerings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online shop navigation adapted to demographic characteristics or visitor history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of customer reviews for bettering product chains and product suggestions to the target group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dialogue-oriented online retail through the use of smart chatbots and voice-controlled services developed by Emerline’s team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email marketing for tailoring relevant content to the respective customer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential business benefits of the solution include the ability to deliver cross-channel personalization. Location targeting and unifying customer insights will help you to stay ahead of competitors and win the hearts of your customers. AI solutions help to create seamless, ultra-personalized customer experiences, so you can optimize your trade spendings and improve ROI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR Shopping App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gt1qUBTa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9fi5p0xzjrr3dieni5c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gt1qUBTa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9fi5p0xzjrr3dieni5c.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 120857"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We develop the mobile app for retail, enhanced with AR features that enables the close to reality experience and gives the app users an opportunity to enjoy smart and easy shopping. An ability to visualize and digitally examine an item without leaving a comfortable apartment, reduces a product’s return rate. Another objective was to retain customers and attract new buyers, which turned out to be a hot-button issue during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our AR/VR expertise covers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D virtual store &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;360-degree view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual fitting rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual showrooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced catalogs and eCommerce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brands that have been early adopters of AR technology have seen a significant lift in sales for several years. Our AR shopping app solution helps to bring your products to life to improve the immersive customer experience, increase buyer confidence, and minimize human contact just using smartphones at any time and everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to innovate your retail business? We will be glad to help you in accomplishing all the technology-related goals you set for your company, so contact us to discuss your project at any time! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 5 Programming Languages To Learn In 2021</title>
      <author>rajdigitech</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 09:07:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rajpolu/top-5-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2021-319d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rajpolu/top-5-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2021-319d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You will need to be able to program in the top 5 programming languages that you will learn in 2021 to make your business competitive. This will give you the edge in competing with other business enterprises. It is important to understand the importance of learning these languages in 2112. It is important to also know the benefits of using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major benefits that you can get from knowing these types of programming languages is that you can create programs faster and easier. You do not need to hire a programmer just to write your programs because you can do it yourself. There are many websites that will help you create programs. You don't need to be an expert in computers. You will not only be able to create simple programs, but you will also be less likely to hire people to do it for your money because you can do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, you will be able to save your money on making sales and you can also gain profits in your business. It's more than that. You can also make your own advertisements in the Internet. You can increase your website traffic if you have enough visitors. If you have a large number of visitors, you will be able to attract a large number of potential customers into your store or business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also help you expand your knowledge and skills in various subjects. You can also increase your knowledge by reading journals and books in English and attending workshops and seminars on these topics. If you are a good speaker, you will surely be able to get praises and positive comments from your visitors and clients because of your excellent speech skills. These types of languages will also help you in giving presentations at work, in seminars, in conferences, and in any other public gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, enrolling in a university that offers these languages can help you increase your chances of being hired in the IT industry. You can find courses at many universities that teach you how to use computer languages when you create programs at your home. This is a great opportunity to make a lot as an IT professional. You can also try to be an employee of some IT company so that you will learn the ins and outs of a particular program and how it should be designed. Because you have experience with the program, you can become an expert in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These languages can also be taught to you so that your programs are more efficient for a company or government agency. If you already have a computer program, you can try to communicate with a client or an expert on that particular software so that you will be able to make the program more efficient. The people who design computer programs are mostly highly educated and most likely have the experience that you may lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, you can enroll in a college that offers computer programs as a bachelor's degree. There are colleges that offer computer language courses to their students. There are colleges that offer a Master's degree in computer programs. If you choose to attend a traditional school, you can expect to learn two or more subjects. You need to be prepared so that you will be able to complete your courses and earn your degree. To be considered for a good college, it is essential that you have a high-school diploma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These languages can be learned online by taking free courses. You can learn computer programming from home on many websites. There are many computer programs available in different levels. This allows you to learn at a pace that suits you so that you can work towards your Master's degree in computer programs. Although it may take some time before you can complete the courses, it is definitely worth it to be able to complete your education.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Python- Intermediate course: Day 27, Entry keypress event</title>
      <author>Aatmaj</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 08:33:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-27-entry-keypress-event-5d15</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-27-entry-keypress-event-5d15</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-us-study-keypress-event-in-tkinter-entry-widget"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let us study keypress event in Tkinter entry widget
&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had made a dummy login program (password manager). But the thing was the password was hidden. The password data can only be accessed by the &lt;code&gt;storepassword()&lt;/code&gt; function. But today how about making a secret trapdoor available for hackers to steal the passwords😈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keypress-event"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keypress event
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can achieve this by writing a piece of code into the main program which scans whatever we write into the password entry widget and prints it in the command prompt. This can be done using the keypress event. &lt;code&gt;e1.bind("&amp;lt;Key&amp;gt;",keypress)&lt;/code&gt; Whenever any key is pressed, then the function 'keypress' is executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the complete code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tkinter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"300x200"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"spyware"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;keypress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# for blank press
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;e1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'*'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;e1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;focus_set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;e1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;Key&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keypress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# mind the case of 'key'- k must be K
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;spy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mainloop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SMIZTGqt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhouxyr5pyx8kiwuy3w3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SMIZTGqt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhouxyr5pyx8kiwuy3w3.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TIg3MOUD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a6vou6e6u6qzy2g4ysp4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TIg3MOUD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a6vou6e6u6qzy2g4ysp4.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is happening? Well, the actual action is taking place in the shell window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ScRcgy7M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9183o8sfeit3l5h2iqzb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ScRcgy7M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9183o8sfeit3l5h2iqzb.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain what the keypress function does. Whenever any key is pressed, the keypress function is executed. This function first extracts out which key is pressed. Then, it converts the key into an ASCII value and prints it in the command shell using a dot for separation. This way, even characters like backspace and enter key can be detected. Parsing this string to get the password is a piece of cake for the hacker😈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is wrapped in try-except to prevent blank key presses, which results in errors like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Exception in Tkinter callback
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\aatma\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\tkinter\__init__.py", line 1884, in __call__
    return self.func(*args)
  File "C:/Users/aatma/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/spy.py", line 6, in keypress
    print(ord(event.char),end=".")
TypeError: ord() expected a character, but string of length 0 found
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Let us now couple the code with our password manager and see the results.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tkinter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# import the Tkinter module
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# create the blank window.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password manager"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# set the title as password manager
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'400x200'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# set the default geometry of the window.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;TB1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# make an entry widget with 20 spaces for the username
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;TB2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;keypress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# for blank press
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;TB2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;Key&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keypress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# entry widget for password and hide the keys whenever pressed.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# TB1 is for username, TB2 is for password
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TB1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;TB2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pack the widgets into 'form'
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# make a label to display the username
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#function to be executed once the button is pressed.

      <title>Little vim distro using Vim8+ packages</title>
      <author>Simone Gentili</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 08:12:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sensorario/a-little-vim-distro-using-vim8-packages-1f3f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sensorario/a-little-vim-distro-using-vim8-packages-1f3f</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vim8-packages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vim8+ packages
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from Vim8 plugins can be installed in &lt;code&gt;~/.vim/pack&lt;/code&gt; folder. In this folder there could be also repositories. For example Git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-nerdtree-plugin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install NERDTree plugin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is the NERDTree installation using Vim8+ packages. As you can see a plugin can be installed in &lt;code&gt;~./bim/pack&lt;/code&gt; folder. This folder can contain a git repository. In the first line the plugin is installed. In the second line its documentation is installed too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree
vim -u NONE -c "helptags ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree/doc" -c q
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-bash-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A bash version
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following four lines the job is the same of the previous chapter. The difference is that destination folder and plugin urls now are variables. So, ... what plugin become a list of items?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;folder="~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree"
url="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git"

git clone $url $folder
vim -u NONE -c "helptags $golder/doc" -c q
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bash-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bash array
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this simple bash array. Odd items are repository path. Even numbers are folders.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;plugins=(
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/vendor/start/vim-airline"
    "https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline.git"
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree"
    "https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git"
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree-git-plugin"
    "https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin.git"
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/packages/start/fzf"
    "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git"
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/packages/start/fzf.vim"
    "https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim.git"
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/tpope/start/fugitive"
    "https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git/"
    "$HOME/.vim/pack/vendor/start/vim-gitgutter"
    "https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter.git/"
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#array-iteration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Array iteration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a script that iterate the array listed in the previous chapter. As you can see only even item are considered. Even items are the folders (&lt;code&gt;folder="${plugins[$i]}"&lt;/code&gt;). Odd items are urls (&lt;code&gt;url="${plugins[$i+1]}"&lt;/code&gt;). In this script I'll check if folder already exists. If the folder exists the repository is pulled down. If the folder does not exists the repository is just cloned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in ${!plugins[@]};
do
    if (( i % 2 == 0 ))
    then
        # echo $i
        folder="${plugins[$i]}"
        url="${plugins[$i+1]}"
        if [ ! -d "$folder" ] ; then
            git clone "$url" "$folder"
        else
            git -C $folder pull 
        fi
    fi
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final result
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final result code I've added just a new line to add the documentation of the plugin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;plugins=(

      <title>Go/Golang Basics - Variables and Data types</title>
      <author>Tarun Kumar J</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 08:05:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tarunj096/go-golang-basics-variables-and-data-types-1n46</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tarunj096/go-golang-basics-variables-and-data-types-1n46</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Basic data types in Go are:&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;complex&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Int, Float, and complex are part of the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start with Integers.There are two categories, One is signed and other is unsigned integers.Signed integers can be negative but unsigned integers are always positive.Signed int is referred as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and Unsigned int as &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are : int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int, uint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package main

import "fmt"

function main() {

            var lengthOfWire uint16 = 36
            var numberOfChocalates int8 = 10 
            var boxlength uint = 200
            var x int =  -450
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next is Floating-Point Numbers. They are of two types &lt;code&gt;float32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;float64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;      var ratingOfTheProduct float32 = 3.5

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the next part is &lt;code&gt;Complex&lt;/code&gt; Numbers. Complex numbers are of two types, complex64 and complex128. The in-built function creates a complex number from its imaginary and real part. Complex numbers can be initialized as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;      var x complex64 = complex( 5, 2)
      var y complex128 = complex( 7, 3)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they are printed then, their output would be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(5 + 2i)
(7 + 3i)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Boolean&lt;/code&gt;: Boolean data type contains only 1 bit of information. It's either 0 or 1. 0 denotes false and 1 denotes true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be initialized as :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;     var isCodingFun bool = true

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last data type is a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. A string stores sequence of characters and it must be surrounded with double-quotes. They can be initialized as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;     var text string = "Hi, Welcome to Golang Blog Series"

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can concatenate two strings by using the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;     var nameOfMovie string = "Avengers Endgame "

     var concatStr string = nameOfMovie + "is one of the greatest superhero movies."

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Variables
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables in the Go language hold a value even before we assign anything to it. They are default values. All the numeric variables have 0 as default and string variables have&lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt;. Boolean variables have false as default value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can declare a variable without stating its type by &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; (short declaration operator ). For example :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
         nameOfMovie := "Avengers Endgame"
         x := 15
         y:= 3.7
         isClimateChangeReal := true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Go also allows us to declare multiple variables in a single line. An Example of that is :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       var x , y = 10,20

       nameOfStreet , sure := "Abbey road" , true 
      //'nameOfStreet' is type 'string' and 'sure' is type 'bool'

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How to create your first Android app using Android Studio?</title>
      <author>Gourav Khunger</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 08:04:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gouravkhunger/how-to-create-your-first-android-app-using-android-studio-5139</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gouravkhunger/how-to-create-your-first-android-app-using-android-studio-5139</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://genicsblog.com/how-to-create-your-first-android-app-using-android-studio"&gt;Read this article on my blog&lt;/a&gt; for a better experience and to listen the audio version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second article in the &lt;a href="https://genicsblog.com/series/android-development"&gt;Android App Development For Beginner&lt;/a&gt; series. If you have followed along with the previous article, then you will have Android Studio set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue this article from where the previous article ended, and by the end, we will be having a Hello World Android App ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's dig into it now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-new-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a new project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now going to create the project, first open Android Studio and you will be presented with this screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---ZTH0480--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631772463954/WoC110PBE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---ZTH0480--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631772463954/WoC110PBE.png" alt="Welcome to Android Studio Screen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the latest Android Studio Arctic Fox &lt;code&gt;2020.3.1&lt;/code&gt;. This might be different from the older post but yeah, the installation process remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Android Studio is open, press the New Project button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G5_2qHyt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631772561088/aBJwhkyQ_.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G5_2qHyt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631772561088/aBJwhkyQ_.png" alt="New Project Button"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing it will take you to the New Project window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--COWcaJzH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631731580840/3jpz5Ssw7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--COWcaJzH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631731580840/3jpz5Ssw7.png" alt="New Project Window"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, you will see a bunch of starter templates for Android Projects, like Basic Activity, Bottom Navigation, Tabbed Activity, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the word Activity is strange to you, don't be afraid. I will explain the concepts in the later articles, but for now, you can understand that an Activity is like a page in the app. Anything that you see in an app, that is, the page, is called an Activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An app can have multiple activities with multiple widgets in them(called Views) that make the app functional. We will dig into the fundamentals of Android and practice them later, for now, you can go with the Empty Activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XE6t65oQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631732822722/J6Kp0MJqq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XE6t65oQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631732822722/J6Kp0MJqq.png" alt="Select Empty Activity From Prebuilt Templates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press the next button. Now you will be asked to give some information about the android app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5zgfDQtw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631733019453/GNXLb_Ode.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5zgfDQtw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631733019453/GNXLb_Ode.png" alt="Give information to Android Studio about your app"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information required is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#app-name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  App Name
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give your app a suitable name. If you don't wish to give it a name yet, don't worry you can edit this later too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#package-name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Package Name
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a unique identifier of your app. The package name is used by the android operating system to distinguish your app from other apps, and also by the google play store to identify different apps on their platform, no two different apps on the store or on an android device can have the same package name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, companies give set the package name of their app by reversing their domain. Like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google uses &lt;code&gt;com.google.android.&amp;lt;identifier-of-app&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for their apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatsapp uses &lt;code&gt;com.whatsapp&lt;/code&gt; as their Android app's package name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discord uses &lt;code&gt;com.discord&lt;/code&gt; as their app's package name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, if you do have a domain name registered under your name, you can proceed to create a package name as explained above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can use the same structure as I am using. Even though I own &lt;code&gt;genicsblog.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gouravkhunger.xyz&lt;/code&gt;, I prefer to use my GitHub URL as the package. Since we are making a hello world app here, I have kept the package name as &lt;code&gt;com.github.gouravkhunger.helloworld&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This identifier is more unique to you because your GitHub account will be used to host your personal projects so I prefer using it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Clarification&lt;/strong&gt;: You don't actually need to own the domain you put into the package name, and there will be no verification if you put another domain. But if you publish the project and later someone claims the domain, there can be conflicts so it's better to use your own, or the way I used my GitHub username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#save-location"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Save location
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android studio will store the project at this location - feel free to store it anywhere you like. The folder must not exist before as Android Studio will create it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Language
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to use kotlin because it is the official language to create android apps. I expect you to know a bit of Java or any other object-oriented programming language like C++ because that would help you to adopt kotlin very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#minimum-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Minimum SDK
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the minimum Android version the app needs to run. It is required to specify it because there are certain things that don't work in older versions of Android. So to ensure backward compatibility, you need to specify the minimum SDK so that all features work seamlessly on the devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always change this field later, so you can choose API 23, which is Android 6.0 (Marshmellow), for now. From my past experience, this API level works with most of the libraries (pre-written code for android apps that makes development easier) and works on ~85% of the devices in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can hit the Finish button and Android Studio will set things up for you! Please wait for 2-3 minutes to let it build the project (depending on your hardware specifications it can take longer/shorter time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3KMKcFcS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631734256571/QJ9wDuGId.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3KMKcFcS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631734256571/QJ9wDuGId.png" alt="Finish button in New Project Window - Android Studio"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-the-hello-world-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run the Hello World project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the project is built, you will see the IDE window with two files open: &lt;code&gt;MainActivity.kt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;acitvity_main.xml&lt;/code&gt;. Actually, Android Studio puts in a simple hello world app when we select an Empty Activity, we will go into more details when subsequent articles get released in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X_6HSHTt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631773265969/Sq2JDNXFps.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X_6HSHTt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631773265969/Sq2JDNXFps.png" alt="Android Studio IDE Project Screen Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://genicsblog.com/beginning-android-development-with-android-studio#emulators-yes-or-no"&gt;In the last article&lt;/a&gt;, I explained whether or not you should use emulators or not. In this article, I will run the app on my device but you can also use &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can enable USB debugging on your Android Device through developer options (I will write an article on it and link it here). Then connect your android device to your machine, and you will see that Android Studio shows the device name on the toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vHyme968--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631774295972/kWzS5YgOC.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vHyme968--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631774295972/kWzS5YgOC.png" alt="Connected Devices in Android Studio"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press the green button beside the name of the device and Android Studio will build an APK  and install it on your device. You might need to allow the installation from a pop-up dialog on your device if it is your first time while installing from android studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the below gif for the above steps in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4SaqtEJ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631775449659/4y5k5NRlC.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4SaqtEJ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631775449659/4y5k5NRlC.gif" alt="Build and run an Android app on a real device - Android Studio"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering- I didn't use any android emulators, as my laptop won't be able to handle screen recording with Android Studio as well as an android emulator open. I have used a tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy"&gt;scrcpy&lt;/a&gt; to simulate my real android device's screen to the laptop, any changes that occur on the device are reflected on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's instantaneous, so you can opt in to choose that way too if you wish to feel an emulator without really having an emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONGRATULATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have successfully built your first Hello World project and installed it on your device 😀.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://genicsblog.com/beginning-android-development-with-android-studio"&gt;Read this article on my blog&lt;/a&gt; for a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! This is the beginning of my new series on Android Development! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, we will be going through various aspects of Android Programming and App Development from the basics to some advanced level topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in this article, we will just get an overview of Android and some motivation on why and how to start with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we will start by installing Android Studio, the Official IDE for making Android Apps, by Google. At last, I will sum up the post and provide some further reading materials so that you can get started with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-android"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's Android?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android is an open-source mobile Operating System owned by Google. It is one of the most popular OS out there! Each day many new people start with an endeavor to make something great with the Android Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since it is based on Linux, it is highly customizable and can work as you need it to. Android devices come in all shapes and sizes as it is very lightweight and can run on old hardware models too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The marketplace for Android is also vast, though competent. Surely, your app may have a base userbase of &amp;gt;1k users within weeks of publishing the app, without even marketing. And I have tested it and that's true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you are motivated enough to know more about development in Android, we will go through the tools required to start with Android!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tools-needed-for-android-dev"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tools needed for Android Dev
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android apps can be developed on any system running Windows, Linux, or Mac. The process is pretty much the same in each case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, what you need is Android Studio, the official IDE supported by Google for android app development. It is based on IntelliJ IDEA IDE for Java by JetBrains, so it looks and works pretty much the same. People who have used any of Jetbrains IDE will not have issues understanding Android Studio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install Android Studio from the official &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio"&gt;Andorid Studio site&lt;/a&gt;. This step will not be very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Android Studio is pre-bundled with a JRE, so you may not need to install any additional kit for Java, though, if you wish, you can install your needed JDK &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Studio installation is a bit heavy and may need some time to complete. Be patient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing and doing all the necessary setups, and opening Android Studio, you will be able to see such a screen: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--htHjynIw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613322813352/3bqWDusIb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--htHjynIw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613322813352/3bqWDusIb.png" alt="Android Studio 4.1.2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The picture may not be the exact same as your version of Android Studio, also I have a theme installed which may not be similar to yours!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now proceed to install the required SDKs (Software Development Kits) for building your apps. On the main screen of Android Studio, click Configure -&amp;gt; SDK Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to install the latest possible version at the moment you are setting it up. Check the box next to the SDK name and then click apply, Android Studio will start setting up the things for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#emulators-yes-or-no"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Emulators- Yes or No?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at this point in time, you may have the android studio and all other stuff set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you may be thinking of how will you test your app while you code. For that, there are two options left now, either you can go with your own real android device, and emulators. Emulators are the copy of real android devices that can run on your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are pretty much like a virtual setup of a device. Though they may not give the same actual experience that you may get on testing your app on a real device, they may give valuable insights on how your app will perform on different SDK versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, an important aspect to notice is that the emulators take up ram and space on your phone to run their set up and that won't be good enough if your system has low specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that if you have at least &amp;gt;16 GB ram, then only you should go for having android emulators to run on your system, as they make the system heavy and cause lags if they don't get enough resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emulators require your system to support virtualization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to run and test apps on a real android device, then you can follow the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device"&gt;official guide&lt;/a&gt; to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't be going to all the further details in this post itself, this post was just to get you started with Android Studio and installing the right stuff for android app development. Hope to see you in the next post!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to alter large MySQL tables on production?</title>
      <author>bright inventions</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:54:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/brightdevs/how-to-alter-large-mysql-tables-on-production-1phd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/brightdevs/how-to-alter-large-mysql-tables-on-production-1phd</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we are going to learn, how to update the structure of the large tables on the production environment, without causing delays, locks, and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#large-table"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Large table
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the large table? Is my table large enough to follow the steps from the tutorial?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluate-the-term"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluate the term
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large is subjective: sometimes, a wide table with 1m rows will be the biggest in the system. Sometimes 30mlns will be "average".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to determine is to answer, what is the impact of updating a specific table during working hours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you afford to put the sign "maintenance work in progress"?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can you run the &lt;code&gt;ALTER&lt;/code&gt; query which will end after 10 minutes and not care about causing the locks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will nobody notice that the application is down for 5 minutes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered "yes" for the questions, you may have the large tables but there is no need to worry about the way you are going to modify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-if-a-regular-migration-will-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check if a regular migration will work
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern databases (including MySQL) support online DDLs e.g. adding columns (nullable) without locking tables. This is by far the easiest and best approach if it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"if it works" - because in some cases - i.e. you have FTS index created - you will be not able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-percona-toolkit-to-update-the-table"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Percona Toolkit to update the table
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case mentioned above, if you have an FTS index created over the table, there is a need to perform the migration some other way. The other way, in this case, is &lt;a href="https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-toolkit"&gt;Percona Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced open source command-line tools, developed and used by the Percona technical staff, that are engineered to perform a variety of MySQL®, MariaDB®, MongoDB®, and PostgreSQL server and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our scenario, &lt;a href="https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/3.0/pt-online-schema-change.html"&gt;pt-online-schema-change&lt;/a&gt; allows you to alter a table’s structure without blocking reads or writes. In the following paragraphs, I described how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not use this tool before reading its documentation and checking your backups carefully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#planning-the-migration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Planning the migration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to perform the change, we need to ensure that migration will be as lightest as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determine what kind of application's activities are related to the table you want to edit - examine the logs that are leading to some operations on the table to find the best timeframe to alter the schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, it was about the night hours. We checked the traffic for the application in the last two weeks' perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k0-Je6js--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e1nip7j171usoe1p18x8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k0-Je6js--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e1nip7j171usoe1p18x8.png" alt="app_traffic"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#executing-the-migration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Executing the migration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to update the table without interruption. You need to remember that the process can take hours. It’s a good practice to start the migration from some remote shell. By doing this, even if your network connection fails, you will be able to connect to the shell and attach to the screen again, without stopping the execution. Moreover, it's worth to consider using Unix' &lt;a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt; program:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ screen -S percona-processing
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you created the screen, you are able to reattach to it later (ie. after network connection crash):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ screen -ls
There is a screen on:
    41303.percona-processing    (Attached)
1 Socket in /var/folders/7g/45p5bfln4k3384t7wcvyrhqh0000gn/T/.screen.
$ screen -R 41303
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the altering command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pt-online-schema-change \
    --alter "ADD COLUMN created_at datetime DEFAULT null" \
    --alter-foreign-keys-method drop_swap \
    --set-vars lock_wait_timeout=5 D={database_name},t={destination_table_name},P={port},h={host_name},u={user_name},p={password} \
    --no-check-foreign-keys \
    --no-check-replication-filters \
    --max-load="Threads_running=100" \
    --critical-load="Threads_running=100" \
    --dry-run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; will prevent from executing the actual migration on the database&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it work? Percona tool is creating a NEW, temporary table (with the modification applied) and copy the data from the original table to the new one. The triggers created on the old table are copying the incoming data during the process. After the whole data is copied, the tool is swapping the tables and removing the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, you learned how to alter your table during the productional application's lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, the update of the entire table took 12hours of processing, ends successfully without causing any downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding your DynamoDB Single Table Performance</title>
      <author>Michael O'Brien</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:54:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sensedeep/understanding-your-dynamodb-single-table-performance-58ab</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sensedeep/understanding-your-dynamodb-single-table-performance-58ab</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Best practices for DynamoDB have evolved to favor single-table design patterns where one database table serves the entire application and holds multiple different application entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design pattern offers greater performance by reducing the number of requests required to retrieve information and lowers operational overhead. It also greatly simplifies the changing and evolving of your DynamoDB designs by uncoupling the entity key fields and attributes from the physical table structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, managing single-table data and performance can often feel like you are peering at &lt;code&gt;Assembly Language&lt;/code&gt;. Composite keys with prefixed and mapped attribute names are single-table design techniques but they can make just reading a single-table item quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is needed are tools that "understand" the single-table schema and can present and organize your data logically according to your application entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this need we've created the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-metrics"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics&lt;/a&gt; library which calculates and emits detailed single-table performance metrics for DynamoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post looks at our libraries &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-metrics"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-onetable"&gt;OneTable&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.sensedeep.com"&gt;SenseDeep&lt;/a&gt; platform that understand your single-table design schema and can create and present detailed metrics to graphically show how your single-table designs are performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#single-table-monitoring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Single Table Monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are the kinds of questions that &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-metrics"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics&lt;/a&gt; can answer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which single-table entity/model is causing the most load and is consuming the most RCU or WCU?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which customer tenant is causing the most load and how much should they be billed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which app or function is causing what percentage of load on DynamoDB and is consuming the most RCU or WCU?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which queries are the most inefficient (items vs scanned) and by which app or model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which operations are being used the most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which entity is using performing scans or other operations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions and others can be answered by using detailed metrics for DynamoDB that profile performance at an application entity/model level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKyPD2Q7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/sensedeep/table-single.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKyPD2Q7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/sensedeep/table-single.png" alt="Single Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dynamodb-metrics-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DynamoDB Metrics Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-metrics"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics&lt;/a&gt; library is an NPM module for Node applications that captures and emits detailed DynamoDB metrics. It has the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates detailed CloudWatch metrics for Tables, Indexes, Apps/Functions, Entities and DynamoDB operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emits metrics using CloudWatch EMF for zero-latency metric creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports AWS V2 and V3 SDKs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple easy integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very low CPU and memory impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean, readable small code base (&amp;lt;400 lines).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full TypeScript support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally integrates with &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/senselogs"&gt;SenseLogs the Serverless Logger&lt;/a&gt; for dynamic control of metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported by the free &lt;a href="https://www.sensedeep.com/"&gt;SenseDeep Developer Plan&lt;/a&gt; for graphical DynamoDB single-table monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#metrics-galore"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Metrics Galore
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DynamoDB Metrics captures detailed statistics across 5 dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table — Per table metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenant — Per tenant metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source — Per application, module or function identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index — Primary or global secondary index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model — Application single-table entity / model name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operation — DynamoDB low-level operation: GetItem, PutItem, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can drill-down to see metrics aggregated by table, tenant, source, index, model or operation. This enables you to pin-point exactly where performance issues may be lurking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these dimension combinations, DynamoDB Metrics emits the following metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read — Read capacity units consumed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write — Write capacity units consumed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latency — Aggregated request latency in milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;count — Count of items returned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scanned — Number of items scanned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requests — Number of API requests issued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these metrics, you can see precisely who is consuming read and write capacity, which requests are running long, which requests are inefficient and are scanning the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-get-dynamodb-metrics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to get DynamoDB Metrics
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get these wonderful single-table metrics for DynamoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-metrics"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics&lt;/a&gt; NPM library can be used by any Node application using DynamoDB. It is configured as AWS SDK middleware and efficiently captures request details with minimal overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use the &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-onetable"&gt;OneTable&lt;/a&gt; library that has this support built-in and get all the other benefits of OneTable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dynamodb-metrics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DynamoDB Metrics
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To configure DynamoDB Metrics, load the library and pass your DynamoDB client instance to the Metrics constructor. The other parameters tell Metrics how to understand your index and key structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Metrics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dynamodb-metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;indexes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;separator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can read more about how to configure Metrics at &lt;a href="https://github.com/sensedeep/dynamodb-metrics/blob/main/README.md"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  OneTable Support
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable DynamoDB Metrics using OneTable, just add &lt;code&gt;metrics&lt;/code&gt; to your OneTable constructor and specify the name of your application or Lambda function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;acme:launcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OneTable uses your defined OneTable schema to understand your key structure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to View DynamoDB Single Table Metrics
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view DynamoDB single-table metrics using CloudWatch or the SenseDeep Serverless Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#viewing-via-sensedeep"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Viewing via SenseDeep
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SenseDeep has pre-configured dashboards and graphs to assist in visualizing your DynamoDB metrics. You can drill down and view metrics at the table, tenant, source, index, model or operation dimension level for any desired time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see which application or function is consuming read/write capacity and how your app data entities are using DynamoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKyPD2Q7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/sensedeep/table-single.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKyPD2Q7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/sensedeep/table-single.png" alt="Single Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SenseDeep also provides intuitive capacity planning and provisioning assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XZ00c04I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/sensedeep/table-provisioning.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XZ00c04I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/sensedeep/table-provisioning.png" alt="Provisioning Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloudwatch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CloudWatch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#metricsV2:graph=~()"&gt;CloudWatch Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, you can see cards for the DynamoDB Metrics dimension combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZkilGcoU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/blog/cloud-watch-dimensions.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZkilGcoU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/blog/cloud-watch-dimensions.png" alt="CloudWatch Dimensions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metrics are created under the &lt;code&gt;SingleTable/Metrics.1&lt;/code&gt; namespace. Clicking on a card provides a list of dimension combinations to graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LSgXtozA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/blog/cloud-watch-graph-metrics.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LSgXtozA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.sensedeep.com/images/blog/cloud-watch-graph-metrics.png" alt="CloudWatch Metrics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#under-the-hood"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Under the Hood
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DynamoDB Metrics library emits metrics using the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format_Specification.html"&gt;CloudWatch EMF&lt;/a&gt; log-based metrics format. This permits zero-latency creation of metrics without impacting the performance of your Lambdas. EMF allows metrics to be emitted without blocking as would be the case with a normal blocking API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DynamoDB Metrics will only emit metrics for dimension combinations that are active. If you have many application entities and indexes, you may end up with a large number of metrics. If your site uses all these dimensions actively, your CloudWatch Metric costs may be high. You will be charged by AWS CloudWatch for the total number of metrics that are active each hour at the rate of $0.30 cents per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your CloudWatch costs are too high, you can minimize your charges by reducing the number of dimensions. The dimensions emitted can be modified via the &lt;code&gt;dimensions&lt;/code&gt; constructor property. Alternatively, you can dynamically enable and disable metrics via the LOG_FILTER parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DynamoDB Metrics are buffered and aggregated to minimize the load on your system. If a Lambda function is reclaimed by AWS Lambda, there may be a few metric requests that are not emitted before the function is reclaimed. This should be a very small percentage and should not significantly impact the quality of the metrics. You can control this buffering via the Metrics constructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining insight into single-table design patterns is the new frontier. Previously, single-table designs with DynamoDB has been a black box and it has been difficult to peer inside and see how the components of your design are operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamodb-metrics"&gt;DynamoDB Metrics&lt;/a&gt; provides an easy way to instrument your code and gain these insights. SenseDeep provides a free developer plan so you can view and analyze these metrics with graphical dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom Type Guards in Typescript</title>
      <author>Maina Wycliffe</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:53:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/this-is-learning/custom-type-guards-in-typescript-4kep</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-learning/custom-type-guards-in-typescript-4kep</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, we covered various approaches that you can take to narrowing types in Typescript. Type narrowing is the process of moving the type of a variable from a less precise to a more precise type i.e. from a union of string and number to string only. You can learn more about type narrowing &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/type-guards-and-narrowing-in-typescript"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to look at how we can create our own custom type guards. Custom type guards will help you to check if a variable is of a certain type before usage, which helps in Type narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for instance the following function, which calculates the area of a shape i.e. Circle or Rectangle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;calculateArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// calculate area&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to calculate the area, we will need to determine whether the shape being passed in is a Rectangle or Circle. We can create a custom type guide that will check if the type of a &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt; and calculate its area, otherwise calculates the area of a circle:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isRectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// calculate area of a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// calculate area of a circle&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-type-predicate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Type Predicate?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A type predicate is a function return type that tells typescript a parameter is of a specific type. A predicate takes the following format: &lt;code&gt;parameterName is Type&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;parameterName&lt;/code&gt; must be the name of a parameter in the function parameter signature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we wanted to build the custom type guard &lt;code&gt;isRectangle&lt;/code&gt; above, our type predicate would be &lt;code&gt;shape is Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; is the parameter name, as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isRectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// function body&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#custom-type-guard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Custom Type Guard
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To define a custom type guard, we create a function that returns a type predicate. The function itself just needs to return true or false. If we take the example above for &lt;code&gt;isRectangle&lt;/code&gt; type guard, we would check if the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; are present and return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise, return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isRectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this is a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// it's not a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we are using Javascripts &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in"&gt;in operator&lt;/a&gt; to check if the width and height properties are in the shape object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the custom type guard, we use it just like any other function that returns a boolean.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isReactangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isReactangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By using it within a control flow, you can narrow the type of the variable, just like other methods of narrowing types.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isRectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rectangle&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// no error&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// error&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Circle&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// no error&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// error&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this brief article, we learned what a Type predicate is and how to build custom type guards. We learned that a type guard is a special function that returns a type predicate so that typescript is able to determine the type of a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue covering similar topics in Typescript in this series - &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/tags/a-byte-of-typescript"&gt;A Byte of Typescript&lt;/a&gt;. A Byte of Typescript is a new series that I will be publishing on a regular basis to help you demystify Typescript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to learn more about Typescript, here are the previous articles I have published. Thank you 😄.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React Native Setup on macOS!</title>
      <author>Krishna Bhamare</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:28:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/krishna7852/react-native-setup-on-macos-5a76</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/krishna7852/react-native-setup-on-macos-5a76</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You're interested in developing React Native on your macOS computer - yay! However, installing React Native can be kind of tricky, there are a lot of different pieces to connect for both iOS development and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let's dive in!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#downloading-xcode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Downloading Xcode
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-xcode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Xcode?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode is Apple's IDE (integrated development environment) for building Mac, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. It supports the Objective-C and Swift languages. We need it for React Native in order to use its build tools, which allows us to compile the native code necessary to build React Native apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode also comes with an iOS "simulator", which lets us run iOS apps on our Mac to see how they'll look and function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while we generally recommend running our React Native app from the terminal (more information on this in the last chapter of this blog!) we can also load up our React Native app in Xcode and run it from there, which lets us use all of the powerful features that Xcode has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12"&gt;Download Xcode from the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dsrro10d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1mzbg6oxuarxohe8n33p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dsrro10d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1mzbg6oxuarxohe8n33p.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-15 at 12.38.02 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#downloading-android-studio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Downloading Android Studio
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-android-studio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Android Studio?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Studio is Google's IDE (integrated development environment) for Android app development. It'll allow us to compile Android apps, set up Android emulators, and also run our React Native project in Android Studio to take advantage of its powerful features if we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio"&gt;Download Android Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-homebrew"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Homebrew
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important tools on macOS is called Homebrew. Homebrew is billed as "the missing package manager" for macOS and is widely used by developers. We will need it to install some of the dependencies for React Native. Plus, it's just super handy for installing other things you may need!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can check if you already have Homebrew installed by running brew --version in your Terminal.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-node"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Node
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-node"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Node?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node is a JavaScript "runtime environment" that lets you run JavaScript from your Terminal (and other places outside of a browser). React Native uses Node to run JavaScript scripts on the command line for things like testing, packaging, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can check if you already have Node installed by running node --version in your Terminal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-watchman"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Watchman
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-watchman"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Watchman?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/"&gt;Watchman&lt;/a&gt; is a tool by Facebook for watching for changes to files in your project. This allows for recompiling, rebundling, and reloading every time you save changes to your source files. While React Native can work without Watchman, it's highly recommended to install it for performance and productivity reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can check if you already have Watchman installed by running watchman --version in your Terminal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-yarn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Yarn
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-yarn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Yarn?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Yarn is a command-line tool created by Facebook that (mostly) replaces NPM. At Infinite Red, we use it for almost everything. It lets us install NPM dependencies and run scripts -- and it's very fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yarn is optional for React Native projects, but I recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can check if you already have Yarn installed by running yarn --version in your Terminal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-your-mac-for-ios-react-native-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up your Mac for iOS React Native Development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-xcode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Xcode
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: even if you've already installed Xcode, you should follow the steps here to ensure it's properly configured.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part requires some patience, but you can do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first page of this section, you should have started downloading Xcode. Hopefully it's finished by now! If so, click the Open button in the App Store or launch it from your Applications folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QL-FzLBZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oz29igryfyfc0z2kdahx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QL-FzLBZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oz29igryfyfc0z2kdahx.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.07.50 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First, you'll need to agree to their Xcode and Apple SDKs Agreement. I'm sure you'll read them carefully. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--giVMB_ub--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrookzrowpx3et5e6hek.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--giVMB_ub--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrookzrowpx3et5e6hek.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.08.16 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode will then install some components before opening.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Ye2Mq-m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5j4jl32vyb9xwpmvi4u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Ye2Mq-m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5j4jl32vyb9xwpmvi4u.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.08.54 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to install the &lt;strong&gt;Command Line Tools&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit ⌘+, (command + comma) to open Xcode Preferences or open it from the Xcode menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bd88XZyn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gk4z0yymitip9he5ci94.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bd88XZyn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gk4z0yymitip9he5ci94.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.09.43 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Locations&lt;/strong&gt; tab and select the item in the Command Line Tools drop-down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yGLWIvVt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ro2gbxd3h0n9iqk8kh5a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yGLWIvVt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ro2gbxd3h0n9iqk8kh5a.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.10.27 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll ask for your password and then install the Command Line Tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next let's install an iOS simulator. In the same Preferences dialog, choose the &lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt; tab and click the down arrow next to the simulator you want to use. I chose the latest (iOS 13.2). It will ask for your password again - maybe even twice. I bet you're getting good at typing that in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MDyl-oWW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wkqdvoo1fj2546du6ou5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MDyl-oWW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wkqdvoo1fj2546du6ou5.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.12.03 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will take a while, so feel free to move on to the next section. When it's done, just close the Preferences dialog box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-cocoapods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing CocoaPods
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-cocoapods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why CocoaPods?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to bring in native third-party packages written in Objective-C or Swift, called CocoaPods, you'll want the CocoaPods CLI. This is sort of like NPM or Yarn, but for native iOS code. It's written in Ruby and requires Ruby (which is installed by default in macOS, although new versions of macOS are reportedly going to remove it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*You can check if you already have CocoaPods installed by running pod --version in your Terminal. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install CocoaPods in a variety of different ways, but I recommend using Homebrew. If you have a Ruby version manager like RVM or rbenv, you can also &lt;a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html"&gt;install using Rubygems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's use &lt;strong&gt;Homebrew:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install cocoapods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it's done, try pod --version to see if it installed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: it may warn you to add export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 to your .zshrc. Check the pod --version output carefully and follow the directions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the iOS Simulator is done downloading (from the previous section), you should be ready to go! You can either move on to setting up Android now, or skip to the section Creating your first &lt;strong&gt;React Native app&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-your-mac-for-android-react-native-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up your Mac for Android React Native Development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-the-java-development-kit-jdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll need the JDK (Java Development Kit) to compile Android apps. The JDK includes an interpreter for Java, the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), a compiler, and many other things critical for building Android apps (and Java apps in general).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we're actually going to be using &lt;a href="https://openjdk.java.net/"&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;, which is a free and open source version of the JDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-jdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing JDK
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Homebrew, this is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note with older versions of Homebrew, you may have to run brew cask install adoptopenjdk8 instead.)&lt;br&gt;
You may need to enter your password again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-android-studio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Android Studio
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully Android Studio has finished downloading! Let's install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, find and run the DMG file that you downloaded. Drag the icon into the Applications folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jzzFmIMl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kk98i2ubsmmfqgrbzm6g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jzzFmIMl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kk98i2ubsmmfqgrbzm6g.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.24.16 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now launch it from Spotlight or your Applications folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mv-AIZyA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f43whv96d312nygh0k48.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mv-AIZyA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f43whv96d312nygh0k48.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.24.49 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will open a setup wizard. Just click Next, and then choose "Custom" in the Install Type screen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--02wagucm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qlxjpptm59buyr93zkc2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--02wagucm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qlxjpptm59buyr93zkc2.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.25.58 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might see a screen that looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--96pG-rlX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8k6eypfnf1bcjm0l1d0h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--96pG-rlX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8k6eypfnf1bcjm0l1d0h.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.26.47 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just click Next to keep the default path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose dark or light theme, and then in the SDK Components Setup screen, make sure Android SDK Platform, API 29, Performance, and Android Virtual Device are all checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5tnYplxJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zgct6prgcqus3ydn73wf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5tnYplxJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zgct6prgcqus3ydn73wf.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.27.43 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click Next. In the next screen (Emulator Settings) leave everything at the default and click Finish to start downloading and installing the SDK components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you may see a message saying System Extension Blocked, If so, click &lt;strong&gt;Open Security Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;, then click on the lock icon, enter your password, and click &lt;strong&gt;Allow&lt;/strong&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JRW9Kti6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rycwhc3orkyuizqhe39q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JRW9Kti6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rycwhc3orkyuizqhe39q.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.29.27 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once it's done, we have more work to do. Let's go to Do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-android-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Android SDK
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with the JDK (Java Development Kit), the Android SDK (Android Software Development Kit) contains Android-specific tools, such as Android libraries, emulators, a debugger, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up Android Studio and click the Configure button on the bottom right of the welcome screen and choose SDK Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: If you don't see the welcome screen, you can also go to the Android Studio Preferences, Appearance &amp;amp; Behavior, System Settings, Android SDK, and then find SDK Manager there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R36s-F-M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gg40hmettqwz30gn4sqg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R36s-F-M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gg40hmettqwz30gn4sqg.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.32.34 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VW-qRi0M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f7eyr3ctfxnxbc42vip6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VW-qRi0M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f7eyr3ctfxnxbc42vip6.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.35.50 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the next steps very carefully and check your work. It can cause some head-scratching problems if you don't!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Show Package Details&lt;/strong&gt; checkbox in the SDK Platforms tab (you should already be on it). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OR1BB5BC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5x2fswgjr8ww1wadp1wt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OR1BB5BC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5x2fswgjr8ww1wadp1wt.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.38.08 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;strong&gt;Android 9 (Pie)&lt;/strong&gt; and open it up, and then check these entries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android SDK Platform 28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image&lt;/strong&gt; (note: do NOT select the similarly named "Intel x86 Atom System Image" by mistake) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vmtNhx2G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ef5fxdwzyc0d4a2bcs12.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vmtNhx2G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ef5fxdwzyc0d4a2bcs12.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.40.01 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go to the SDK Tools tab. Click "Show Package Details" in this tab too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find "Android SDK Build-Tools" and check "28.0.3" (exactly that version). On mine, 29.0.2 is also checked, don't uncheck it (or whichever one is checked on yours) unless you intend to make your own Android Virtual Device which uses SDK 28. For the majority of you, just leave both 28.0.3 and whatever was already checked, and move along. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bWII973b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8y99ifeoowmrhu2eq2ko.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bWII973b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8y99ifeoowmrhu2eq2ko.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.41.43 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click "Apply" and "OK" on the &lt;strong&gt;Confirm Change dialog&lt;/strong&gt;. It should look something like this .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qfICtJ77--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r27vmyqutiajg4ghpwt0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qfICtJ77--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r27vmyqutiajg4ghpwt0.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.42.29 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click "Accept" on each of the items in the License Agreement dialog and then "Next". When it's done, click "Finish".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Let's move on to the next step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-the-androidhome-environment-variable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring the ANDROID_HOME environment variable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;strong&gt;npx react-native run-android&lt;/strong&gt;, React Native needs to know where all of the Android dependencies live. This environment variable (ANDROID_HOME) is where it'll look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to set up our path to allow our system to know where the emulator command and other commands live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-androidhome-and-path"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring ANDROID_HOME and PATH
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you could have various shells set up, such as zsh or bash, and will need to properly choose which one to add these lines to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this command to figure out what shell you are in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it says &lt;strong&gt;-zsh&lt;/strong&gt;, you're in zsh. If it says &lt;strong&gt;-bash&lt;/strong&gt; you're in bash. If it's something else, hopefully you know what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;bash&lt;/strong&gt;, you want to put these lines in ~/.bash_profile (probably) or &lt;strong&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/strong&gt; (possibly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;zsh&lt;/strong&gt;, you want to put these lines in &lt;strong&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/strong&gt; (probably).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible you may need to create one of these files if they don't already exist. Just run touch &lt;strong&gt;~/.&lt;/strong&gt; to create the proper file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that if you customized where the Android SDK is, you'll need to change the first line. If you didn't customize anything, it's probably correct as-is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let's say you are on zsh and want to add these to &lt;strong&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/strong&gt;. You can append them by running this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo "export ANDROID_HOME=\$HOME/Library/Android/sdk&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/emulator&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/tools&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin&lt;br&gt;
export PATH=\$PATH:\$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're done, you can test it in a new Terminal window with this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $ANDROID_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should output something like /Users//Library/Android/sdk. You can also check your path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and see if it's correct. Note (again) that you do need to open a new terminal window (with command+N or command+T) to load the new environment variables -- editing the file won't change them for the current terminal session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-new-react-native-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a new React Native project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We're finally ready to spin up a new React Native project!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your Terminal back up and change directories to your code folder where you keep your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's run the React Native CLI via NPM's built-in "npx" command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx react-native init ReactNativeApp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will start the process of building a brand-new React Native app. (Note that it may install a bunch of dependencies and spit out a bunch of warnings -- you can mostly ignore those.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it's created, change directories into the new app and start it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd ReactNativeApp&lt;br&gt;
for iOS:&lt;br&gt;
npx react-native run-ios&lt;br&gt;
for Android:&lt;br&gt;
npx react-native run-android&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, you should see the iOS simulator or Android emulator start up with your new app!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--95koWq9X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fszvjfyz1e421txdxaai.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--95koWq9X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fszvjfyz1e421txdxaai.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 12.56.06 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CONGRATULATIONS!!! You're all set up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use Prometheus and Grafana to Visualize ISP Packet Loss</title>
      <author>Eric Yi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ericyi/use-prometheus-and-grafana-to-visualize-isp-packet-loss-2eh</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since people started working from home, poor video/voice call connections have become a very annoying problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it's hard for people to diagnose what is the root cause. People start blaming their ISPs, and I feel bad for them. In fact, there are a number of reasons that can cause poor video call connections, but if you can tell us with great confidence that my problem is not from your end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should probably start monitoring your ISP  packet loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grafana(You can register a free &lt;a href="https://grafana.com/auth/sign-in?plcmt=top-nav&amp;amp;cta=myaccount"&gt;Grafana Cloud account&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus (You can &lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/"&gt;install it&lt;/a&gt; on your Raspberry Pi or NAS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source Router OS (OpenWRT, ClearOS, Asuswrt-Merlin etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-pingexporter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set Up ping_exporter
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSH in to your router &amp;gt; Download ping_exporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check which version you need &lt;a href="https://github.com/czerwonk/ping_exporter/releases"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/czerwonk/ping_exporter/releases#:~:text&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ping_exporter_0.4.7_linux_arm64.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extract the file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-xf&lt;/span&gt; ping_exporter_&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.tar.gz ping_exporter
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Move to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mv &lt;/span&gt;ping_exporter /usr/local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choose the way you like to get the ISP's DNS servers on your router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt; /etc/resolv.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;ping_exporter.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file under &lt;code&gt;/etc/ping_exporter/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;targets:
  - &amp;lt;Your ISP&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'s DNS servers&amp;gt;

ping:
  interval: 2s
  timeout: 3s
  history-size: 42
  payload-size: 120
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;ping_exporter.service&lt;/code&gt; file under &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Unit]
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ping_exporter

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Service]
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;root
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/bin/ping_exporter &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt;.path /etc/ping_exporter/ping_exporter.yaml
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;always

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Install]
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;WantedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;multi-user.target
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reload the service files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start your &lt;code&gt;ping_exporter.service&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl start ping_exporter.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check the status of your &lt;code&gt;ping_exporter.service&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl status ping_exporter.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enable your &lt;code&gt;ping_exporter.service&lt;/code&gt; on every reboot:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable &lt;/span&gt;ping_exporter.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Get the results for testing via cURL:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:9427/metrics
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-a-target-to-prometheus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add a target to Prometheus
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your Prometheus configuration file, add the target in the &lt;code&gt;static_config&lt;/code&gt; section :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- targets: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;Your router's ip/dns address&amp;gt;:9427"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reload your Prometheus’ configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-grafana-panel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a Grafana Panel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a new Panel in your home network's dashboard, we are going to use the &lt;code&gt;ping_loss_percent&lt;/code&gt; metric.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ping_loss_percent&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;Your router's ip/dns address&amp;gt;:9427"&lt;/span&gt;,target&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;lt;Your ISP's DNS servers&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--epqFwpjr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2y7h6c4o2lgt3mjmkzwd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--epqFwpjr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2y7h6c4o2lgt3mjmkzwd.png" alt="Packet Loss Pannel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
