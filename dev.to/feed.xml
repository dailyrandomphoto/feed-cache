      <title>Why I Love Polywork as a Software Developer
</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven't heard about Polywork yet you're definitely missing out on something exciting. I recently saw someone talking about Polywork on Twitter a month ago and was intrigued to see what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after this, I got the invite code from one of my friends on Twitter and I signed up on the platform instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial impression was that Polywork was just another social media platform for software developers that will die soon. But as I started using it more, Polywork proved me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-is-polywork"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, What is Polywork?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polywork is a professional social media platform that helps you highlight your achievements, journal your work, events, network with like-minded people, and also get more work in your interested domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But how does it differ from LinkedIn?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is more of a social network around your job. It helps you create your presence around your resume, your job titles, and your work experiences.&lt;br&gt;
But resumes often do not reflect all the achievements we do. They do not tell our whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are more than our job or education. We all do a wide variety of wonderful things, both in our 9–5 and outside of 9-5. We are creators, podcasters, YouTubers, investors, and more. All these different aspects create our professional identity.&lt;br&gt;
But none of the existing social media platforms help us highlight these parts of our identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's where Polywork comes in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polywork can be used to highlight anything you have done as part of your work and even outside of your work. It's not tied to any one type of work. It could be joining a company in a role, speaking at a conference, live streaming a video, releasing an eBook, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's a place to showcase all of your achievements!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#heres-how-im-using-polywork-and-why-i-love%C2%A0it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here's how I'm using Polywork and why I love it:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-highlights"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Highlights
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MM7liEh2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167237766/yk1LKVBZ0.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MM7liEh2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167237766/yk1LKVBZ0.jpeg" alt="polywork-titan.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite features on the platform is highlights. Highlights let me track all my achievements as milestones on my profile. It provides a way to let people know about the different things I'm working on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But how is it different from posts/tweets on LinkedIn/Twitter respectively you may ask?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a job. I build SaaS products. I love content creation. I create eBooks. I write articles. I do a lot of things and I want to highlight all of them in one place. Polywork lets me do this in a much better way compared to other professional platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a huge audience on Twitter and I do share my milestones there. But they get lost eventually because of the number of tweets I post. On the other hand, Highlights on Polywork helps me keep only the important events and milestones as a timeline. For example, these are some of the highlights I have on my Polywork profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reached 30K followers milestone on Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a new role at Unacademy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reached 20K followers milestone on Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published an eBook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q2lYZEKw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167309006/XFymNxJkm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q2lYZEKw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167309006/XFymNxJkm.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 11.25.14 AM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These highlights help me showcase my milestones to visitors and let me know what I'm up to. It helps me get more work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other achievements that others generally highlight on the platform are like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished reading a book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted a conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoke at a conference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a YouTube live stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote an article, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples. You can highlight anything you want to showcase to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-multiverse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Multiverse
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N3LNsUeW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167362744/FwzjSKkX3.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N3LNsUeW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167362744/FwzjSKkX3.jpeg" alt="polywork-connected.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Multiverse is a place to find other people in your interested domain, network with them, and see what they've been doing. Highlights from everyone in your interested domain appear here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even filter Highlights based on trending Badges. For example, you can see Featured People and all the highlights from Software Engineering Badge. This is a great place to find like-minded people and connect with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often find myself looking through interesting badges like Book Worm, Software Developer, Lifelong Learner, Writer, etc hoping to network with other people who are interested in these topics as well. Polywork makes it really easy to find such people. Badges are at the center of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing where multiverse is a game-changer for me is that it gives me a lot of ideas on how people are building businesses and making money on the internet. &lt;br&gt;
One of the main reasons for us to not try something new is that we just don't know that it exists. I couldn't make money on the internet for years for this same reason. Once I started following the right people on Twitter I was able to make a good amount of money by applying the same approach they followed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The What everyone's doing section gives a very good idea about what others are doing and how they are doing it. I have been learning about new ways to build multiple income streams, developer advocacy, etc just by following the right people on Polywork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xsCR8JBt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167401333/X7GUufu-I.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xsCR8JBt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631167401333/X7GUufu-I.png" alt="polywork-space1.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Space Station is a relatively new feature centered around collaborations. It makes it really easy for you to find people to collaborate with on anything. Be it finding a mentor, hiring for a role, finding a partner for a side project, finding an investor, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows how important Networking is. Space Station is really powerful to network if used correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have a huge audience on Twitter and I'm planning to release more info products in the future. I can write an eBook on a topic I know about. I'm confident I can put together a great book with a lot of value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I lack knowledge in certain areas like marketing, designing, branding, etc. I can totally find people who are open to collaborations on these things and make my eBook a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not a developer but have an idea to build a SaaS product. Space Station is the right place to find developers who are open to collaborate on our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a company and are looking to scale it by getting investments, Polywork will help you connect with investors who are open to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunities are just endless.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you're not on Polywork yet, you should get on it soon and check it out. Here is my  &lt;a href="https://www.polywork.com/invite/sunilc_-jigglypuff"&gt;VIP link&lt;/a&gt;  you can use to sign up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect with me on Polywork  &lt;a href="https://www.polywork.com/sunilc_"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article was originally published on my blog &lt;a href="https://sunilkumarc.in/why-i-love-polywork-as-a-software-developer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How do you handle your Accounting?</title>
      <author>Madza</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 06:52:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/madza/how-do-you-handle-your-accounting-2l6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/madza/how-do-you-handle-your-accounting-2l6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freelance is not about just getting clients and delivering your services. Since you are a boss for yourself, you have to think about other things in parallel, one of them being accountable for your finance flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to handling this, I've seen different approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some use standard spreadsheets like Excel or similar solutions on cloud like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/"&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt;. There are built-in templates for accounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others use Accounting software (usually paid for advanced features) like &lt;a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/"&gt;FreshBooks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/global/"&gt;QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.waveapps.com/"&gt;Wave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.xero.com/"&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/books/"&gt;Zoho Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.freeagent.com/"&gt;FreeAgent&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or do you hire a professional to handle all of that, so you can fully concentrate with interactions with your clients and your business logic? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's your approach on handling your Accounting and how much do you spend on it monthly (if so)?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Imposter Syndrome?</title>
      <author>Abhiraj Bhowmick</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 06:34:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rainboestrykr/what-is-imposter-syndrome-2b8m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rainboestrykr/what-is-imposter-syndrome-2b8m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every person, sooner or later, is going to suffer from this thing which we label “imposter syndrome”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have this feeling now, but you don’t know that it has a name attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me describe some situations where you might find imposter syndrome in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt; 
&lt;li&gt; You are a developer, have no Computer Science degree, and you feel people that have the CS degree know a lot more than you, and you should get one too in order to be called a developer
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You work on a project and you call it a little side project, not a real project, because - you know - it’s just a simple app
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You think other developers know a lot more than you do.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now sometimes I think the solution is to tell yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everyone’s winging it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no one really knows what they are doing
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people you look up to like to show themselves as overconfident publicly, but under the hood they’re not really like that
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things will always be like this
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is still very self-deprecating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real response to all this thinking is to realize how far you went from when you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a day when you could not even figure out how to start the computer. What code even was. You didn’t know you could actually create programs and make the computer do what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the best version of yourself and yet you are perfectly sure that tomorrow you’ll be an even better version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are improving. Just like your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to stop feeling like an impostor is to stop thinking like an impostor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break the silence. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate feelings from fact. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize when you should feel fraudulent. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accentuate the positive. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a healthy response to failure and mistake making. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right the rules.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a new script.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize success.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know you are not perfect at your craft, and I think that this is a feeling that might never go away. After all programming is such an enormous field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we all know that person that is very overconfident, and will deprecate others just because they don’t know that specific thing they happen to know a lot about… well, don’t be that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find your sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ll even get better at your craft if you start believing more that you were made for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of solving a bug is identifying that bug. The rest comes easier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to build a personalized image social sharing app with Cloudinary and Next.js</title>
      <author>Salma Alam-Naylor</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 05:57:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/whitep4nth3r/how-to-build-a-personalized-image-social-sharing-app-with-cloudinary-and-next-js-2640</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/whitep4nth3r/how-to-build-a-personalized-image-social-sharing-app-with-cloudinary-and-next-js-2640</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you seen &lt;a href="https://tickets.contentful.com/fastforward2021?name=Salma&amp;amp;shared=true"&gt;Contentful’s event website that generates customized and shareable ticket images&lt;/a&gt; that we released for our annual conference &lt;a href="https://www.contentful.com/fast-forward"&gt;Fast Forward&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UaLd2ymq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y39n29cr192syicblhs8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UaLd2ymq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y39n29cr192syicblhs8.png" alt='A screenshot from the Fast Forward ticket website with the text "Salma is going!", a personalised ticket image, and a sign up CTA.'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As events continue to evolve in the digital landscape, you might have seen some fun and engaging personalized event tickets shared on social media for &lt;a href="https://graphqlconf.org/ticket/salma-alam-naylor-002351"&gt;GraphQL Conf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/conf/tickets/jun21/whitep4nth3r#room-mszfy"&gt;Next.js Conf&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. I love this idea — not only for the fun factor. It also showcases just how many great low-cost services and capabilities exist in web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’re going to build a front-end application with &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/"&gt;Cloudinary&lt;/a&gt; that creates a personalized image of a ticket based on URL parameters to share on Twitter and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gyVeKOGa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5dgftmzilos20nk6w9ax.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gyVeKOGa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5dgftmzilos20nk6w9ax.png" alt="A collage of GraphQL conf, Nextjs Conf and Fast Forward Conf social sharing event tickets in a range of desktop and mobile views."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also configure the app to behave differently for the ticket holder and anyone else who views the ticket. The beauty of this approach is that the possibilities for dynamic image sharing are endless. Previously, I wrote about Three ways to use Puppeteer and Node.js to screenshot web pages and generate dynamic Open Graph images for social sharing. However, building this functionality with Cloudinary was so much simpler that I’m thinking of switching to this method for the Open Graph images on my blog! 🙈&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/contentful" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__org__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XBFNG6UL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--leQM9WN9--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/organization/profile_image/390/6233b08f-25c6-4d56-98bb-10a1ea51bad0.png" alt="Contentful"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__user__pic"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gFhxX9YI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--89x-qD1I--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/492757/d64f2cf8-616d-4a73-af1c-17273b0c8545.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/contentful/three-ways-to-use-puppeteer-and-node-js-to-screenshot-web-pages-and-generate-dynamic-open-graph-images-for-social-sharing-5fjj" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Three ways to use Puppeteer and Node.js to screenshot web pages and generate dynamic Open Graph images for social sharing&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Salma Alam-Naylor for Contentful ・ Mar 17 ・ 9 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#webdev&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#serverless&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#javascript&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#node&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sneak preview of what we’ll build. The name parameter in the URL provides a name to embed on the image itself via the Cloudinary API rather than being overlaid via HTML and CSS. We’ll also generate a random ticket number and configure the app to behave differently for viewers who aren’t ticket holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4gj2ZAbg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g8ylhri9t390iova06fp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4gj2ZAbg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g8ylhri9t390iova06fp.png" alt="A screenshot of the Fast Forward ticket app, showing how the parameters from the URL translate to the content on the page. You can see that the name parameter from the URL is embedded onto the image of the ticket, and the random ticket number is also highlighted at the right of the ticket."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing you’ll need for this tutorial is an image you’d like to personalize. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sign-up-for-cloudinary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sign up for Cloudinary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/"&gt;Cloudinary&lt;/a&gt; is an image and video asset management service that provides an API for customizing your media on the fly. Add text to your images, style it with colors and custom fonts, crop, rotate, resize, recolour, detect faces… it's pretty powerful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head on over to Cloudinary and click &lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free"&gt;sign up for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Flee4t_W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a90phh4g9pcfonh0m307.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Flee4t_W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a90phh4g9pcfonh0m307.png" alt="A screenshot of the Cloudinary sign up form."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve confirmed your email address, log in to Cloudinary and you’ll be greeted with a welcome screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_VdgtLbN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4a1vsk5wa5rm609o5t6g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_VdgtLbN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4a1vsk5wa5rm609o5t6g.png" alt="A screenshot of the Cloudinary welcome screen that you see after you log in to a fresh account."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#upload-your-assets-to-cloudinary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Upload your assets to Cloudinary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Media Library navigation item and click Upload in the top right corner. Select your template image and after a second or two, you’ll see the new image asset in your dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eBQ3xrqs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ib4w0htigil258r11n47.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eBQ3xrqs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ib4w0htigil258r11n47.png" alt="A screenshot of the media upload area in Cloudinary, showing a blue border around the new ticket image I just uploaded."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your asset will be uploaded with an auto-generated suffix. Click on the asset to open it in the preview pane to change the file name so that it’s easier for you to recognize the image name in the code later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NwiXgS8R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ik8i7ukqsj3fn5j8wxyu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NwiXgS8R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ik8i7ukqsj3fn5j8wxyu.png" alt="A screenshot of the Cloudinary media upload screen, showing the new image asset just uploaded selected. On the right, an edit panel is revealed, showing that I edited the auto-generated image name for ease of use later."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also uploaded some custom fonts to Cloudinary to ensure the image personalizations were on brand for Contentful. Given that you can use a variety of Google fonts with the Cloudinary API, I won’t cover fonts in this post, but you can learn how to upload custom fonts via the Cloudinary media library from &lt;a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/upload-custom-font-cloudinary-media-library/"&gt;this post by Jason Lengstorf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our image asset is stored safely in Cloudinary. Let’s get coding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-new-nextjs-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a new Next.js app
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Next.js for this application to harness the power of server-side rendering using URL parameters, which will power the image personalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To spin up a new Next.js application, run the following command in your terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app ticket-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command creates a new directory that includes all code to get started. The output below is what you should see after you run the command in your terminal. (I’ve truncated the output a little with ‘/* more things happen here */’ but what you’re looking for is ✨ Done!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hQOHR7Bk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2bclz3r4u0w1ciob829a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hQOHR7Bk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2bclz3r4u0w1ciob829a.png" alt="A screenshot of a terminal window showing the truncated output of the create next app command."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the root of your project directory and start the development server:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;ticket-app
npm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href="https://localhost:3000/"&gt;https://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; in your browser and you’ll see your fresh Next.js app in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hyBStGYv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jztyyto9wcu1tipsnrmm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hyBStGYv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jztyyto9wcu1tipsnrmm.png" alt='A screenshot of the index page of a fresh Next.js app. The heading reads "Welcome to Next.js" and below are some links to documentation.'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s build our page for the ticket!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-your-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build your page
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Next.js application, any JavaScript file you add to the pages directory becomes a route on the front end. You can choose to work on &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; or create a new file in the pages directory. In the final implementation, I created &lt;code&gt;fast-forward.js&lt;/code&gt; inside the pages directory to allow for the fact that the app will be used for future events. To account for this, I made sure all requests for the index were redirected to the current event page. For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll work on index.js and serve the generated tickets under the root URL &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h8tre_F5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e02fsuo8qs800wpmdgwv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h8tre_F5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e02fsuo8qs800wpmdgwv.png" alt="A screenshot of the file tree in VS code. It shows a pages folder with index.js highlight inside it."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-with-a-blank-slate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start with a blank slate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delete most of the boilerplate code from index.js until you’re left with a nice blank canvas to work with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* We'll write some functions here! */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* We'll configure the event data here! */&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;My&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;awesome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* We'll build our page here! */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-the-serverside-props"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure the server-side props
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image stored in Cloudinary will be personalized with the name of the ticket holder, grabbed from a URL parameter. Here’s the URL we’ll be working with in development.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:3000?name=whitep4nth3r
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a pure JavaScript application, you can process the URL parameter on the client-side to build the page content — but with Next.js we can use &lt;code&gt;getServerSideProps()&lt;/code&gt; to render the page on the server using the value of the URL parameter. This prevents visitors to your page from seeing a flash of undefined content or having to show a loading state as the parameter is read by the browser. &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering"&gt;Read more about getServerSideProps() on the Next.js documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following &lt;code&gt;getServersideProps()&lt;/code&gt; function to the bottom of your index.js file. This function will be called with a context object, from which we can destructure the query parameters. We’ll display the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; query parameter on the ticket, and we’ll use the &lt;code&gt;isShared&lt;/code&gt; parameter to configure how the page looks depending on whether the page has been visited by the ticket holder, or shared and visited via social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, configure the Index component to take in the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isShared&lt;/code&gt; props.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* We'll write some functions here! */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* We'll configure the event data here! */&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* … */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return the properties so they are available in the `Index` component&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;decodeURI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s set up a few event variables to reuse in a few places to avoid lots of copying and pasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-your-event-details"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure your event details
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up the following variables inside your Index component: &lt;code&gt;eventName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ticketAppUrl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll use these values later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* We'll write some functions here! */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Event info config */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My awesome event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketAppUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://my-awesome-ticket-app.dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;decodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; is Going! | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Join &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;. Grab your free ticket on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketAppUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optional-generate-a-ticket-number-if-you-dont-have-one"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optional: generate a ticket number (if you don’t have one)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have access to legitimate ticket numbers for the Fast Forward 2021 event, but I still wanted to include a unique-ish ticket number in the design to make the personalized tickets look more official. The code in the final implementation generates a number from any given string, and the return value is prefixed with 000. Each unique string produces a unique number — the only caveat to this method being that if more than one person named “whitep4nth3r” receives a ticket to Fast Forward, then their ticket numbers will be the same. You get the gist. 🙈 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this tutorial, we can use &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; to generate a ticket number.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Event info config... */&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Generate a fake ticket number */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketNo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;substr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve configured the data, we need to personalize the image using Cloudinary. Let’s get to the fun stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#personalize-your-cloudinary-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Personalize your Cloudinary image
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cloudinary API lets you make all sorts of image customizations via URL parameters. As an example, here’s the URL generated for my own Fast Forward ticket. Cloudinary accepts an image URL (&lt;code&gt;fastforward2021.png&lt;/code&gt;) with prepended parameters separated by commas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://res.cloudinary.com/devrelcontentful/image/upload/w_831,h_466,c_fill,q_auto,f_auto,r_20/w_760,c_fit,co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,x_46,y_239,l_text:avenirdemi.otf_48:whitep4nth3r/w_760,c_fit,co_rgb:2a3039,a_90,g_north_east,x_84,y_100,l_text:avenirreg.otf_16:NO./w_760,c_fit,co_rgb:2a3039,a_90,g_north_east,x_55,y_140,l_text:avenirreg.otf_56:0007964/fastforward2021.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The URL is built up of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudinary base URL — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com"&gt;https://res.cloudinary.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloudinary cloud name — &lt;strong&gt;devrelcontentful&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset type — &lt;strong&gt;image/upload&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Width — &lt;strong&gt;w_831&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Height — &lt;strong&gt;h_466&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crop mode — &lt;strong&gt;c_fill&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic asset format selection for best browser experience — &lt;strong&gt;f_auto&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rounded corners of 20px — &lt;strong&gt;r_20&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text area width of 760px — &lt;strong&gt;w_760&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name text area crop mode — &lt;strong&gt;c_fit&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name text color (as a hex code without the #) — &lt;strong&gt;ffffff&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name text gravity — &lt;strong&gt;g_south_west&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name text position coordinates — &lt;strong&gt;x_46,y_239&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name font and size — &lt;strong&gt;l_text:avenirdemi.otf_48&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name text value — &lt;strong&gt;:whitep4nth3r&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same is repeated for the ticket number text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the URL ends with the name of the image as stored in Cloudinary — &lt;strong&gt;fastforward2021.png&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some JavaScript code used to generate a URL like this. At first glance, it might look overwhelming. But, once you understand how it all pieces together, you’ll want to personalize images at every opportunity! Big thanks to Jason Lengstorf for &lt;a href="https://github.com/jlengstorf/get-share-image"&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;, which provided some inspiration and insight to some common gotchas when working with Cloudinary URLs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;generateImageUrl()&lt;/code&gt; below takes a number of required and optional parameters to build up a Cloudinary image URL like we explored above, to generate a personalized image. Depending on your image and how you want it personalized, you’ll want to play around with the default input parameters of &lt;code&gt;generateImageUrl()&lt;/code&gt;, most notably the offset values, colors, font sizes and gravity values. Note that I’ve used the font “Arial” instead of the custom font used in the URL above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on how to configure these values, refer to the &lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations"&gt;Cloudinary image transformations documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, add an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to your Index component and add the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attributes to render your personalized image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Encode characters for Cloudinary URL */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cleanText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;encodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;23|2C|2F|3F|5C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;%25$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* CONFIG vars */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CLOUD_NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;the-claw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IMG_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;831&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IMG_HEIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;466&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Build the Cloudinary Image URL */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;generateImageUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketNo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imagePublicID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloudinaryUrlBase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://res.cloudinary.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IMG_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IMG_HEIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;textAreaWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;760&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketNoFont&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketNoGravity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;north_east&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noFont&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo! We’ve got a personalized image via the Cloudinary API as a URL! Next, let’s use this to show a preview of the ticket when attendees share your event on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-open-graph-meta-for-social-sharing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure Open Graph meta for social sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power behind those ticket previews you see on Twitter and LinkedIn is all down to the magic of the &lt;a href="https://opengraphprotocol.org/"&gt;Open Graph protocol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Tweet above to show the Open Graph preview in action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Graph (OG) protocol was created at Facebook in 2010 to enable web page links to become rich objects with similar functionality and appearance to other content posted on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Graph meta tags are used in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of an HTML page to expose information about web pages to social media platforms and other applications that unfurl URL metadata. OG meta tags are identified in the HTML by an attribute prefixed with &lt;code&gt;og&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"og:image"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://example.com/image.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OG meta tags can also be used to customize the appearance of your web pages according to the platform it’s shared on. For example, Twitter rolled out their own custom implementation of this, built on the OG protocol, and the following code tells Twitter to show the large image web page previews.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"twitter:card"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"summary_large_image"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"twitter:image"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://example.com/image.png"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Next Head component — imported at the top of the file and rendered inside the Index component — will add the meta tags we define inside it to the head of the resulting HTML page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define an &lt;code&gt;ogUrl&lt;/code&gt; variable above the return statement of the Index component as &lt;code&gt;${ticketAppUrl}?name=${name}&amp;amp;shared=true&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that we’re adding a second URL parameter onto the end of the URL — &lt;code&gt;shared&lt;/code&gt; — which we configured in &lt;code&gt;getSeverSideProps()&lt;/code&gt; earlier. This will become important in the next couple of steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the relevant OG meta tags inside the Next Head component tags to enable a fancy image preview with a title and description to show on Twitter and LinkedIn. You’ll notice we’re making good use of those event configuration variables we defined earlier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;og:locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en_US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;og:image:alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;og:image:width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IMG_WIDTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;og:image:height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IMG_HEIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;og:site_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s create those social share links for your attendees to generate some excitement for your event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-twitter-and-linkedin-social-sharing-links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add Twitter and LinkedIn social sharing links
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where all of the magic we conjured above comes together. We’re going to build a Twitter Web Intent URL and LinkedIn share URL that,  &lt;strong&gt;when your website is live (and this is the important part!)&lt;/strong&gt;, will pull in the image you personalized via Cloudinary via the Open Graph &lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt; meta tag in your HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code below shows examples of how to create Twitter and LinkedIn share URLs. Things to bear in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to use line breaks (&lt;code&gt;/n&lt;/code&gt;) in your tweet, make sure you wrap your tweet text in &lt;code&gt;encodeURIComponent()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure you include &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;shared=true&lt;/code&gt; on your share URLs — you’ll see why in the next step!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to convert all equals (=) symbols in the LinkedIn share URL to the HTML character code &lt;code&gt;%3D&lt;/code&gt; — otherwise the link won’t work correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, add anchor links to the Index component below the image tag, with your configured Twitter and LinkedIn share URLs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Event info config... */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Generate a fake ticket number... */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Build the Cloudinary image URL... */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Configure Open Graph URL... */&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Twitter Config */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweetText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;encodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;I just got my ticket to an awesome event!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Grab your free ticket and join me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;twitterShareUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;encodeURIComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketAppUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;shared=true`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;twitterShareHref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;twitterShareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweetText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* LinkedIn Config */&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkedInShareUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ticketAppUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?name%3D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;shared%3Dtrue`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkedInShareHref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkedInShareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My ticket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;twitterShareHref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;_blank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;noreferrer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkedInShareHref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;_blank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;noreferrer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s just one more step. Finally, let’s configure the web page for visitors to your site who clicked on a link from social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-your-web-page-for-social-clicks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure your web page for social clicks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;code&gt;isShared&lt;/code&gt; prop we captured in &lt;code&gt;getServerSideProps()&lt;/code&gt;? Here’s where it comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare my Fast Forward ticket confirmation URL with the link shared on Twitter below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-ticket-confirmation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My ticket confirmation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the full URL with a name parameter only: &lt;a href="https://tickets.contentful.com/fastforward2021?name=Salma"&gt;https://tickets.contentful.com/fastforward2021?name=Salma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1-_Q3ahr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d4urz9t4ux59z3utbqgd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1-_Q3ahr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d4urz9t4ux59z3utbqgd.png" alt="A screenshot of my Fast Forward ticket confirmation with the headline &amp;quot;You're in!&amp;quot; and sharing CTAs to Twitter and LinkedIn, and an add to calendar button."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-people-see-when-they-click-on-the-link-in-my-tweet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What people see when they click on the link in my tweet
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the full URL with a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter and &lt;code&gt;shared&lt;/code&gt; parameter: &lt;a href="https://tickets.contentful.com/fastforward2021?name=Salma&amp;amp;shared=true"&gt;https://tickets.contentful.com/fastforward2021?name=Salma&amp;amp;shared=true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WLQUBdFV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3z8opf9jdohibeznosg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WLQUBdFV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3z8opf9jdohibeznosg.png" alt='A screenshot from the Fast Forward ticket website with the text "Salma is going!", a personalised ticket image, and a sign up CTA.'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the code below to configure a different headline and subtitle depending on the value of the &lt;code&gt;isShared&lt;/code&gt; parameter received by the Index component. Furthermore, non-attendees of the event see a call to action to sign up for the event, rather than sharing it on social media.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/index.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Page text config */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;headline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; is going!`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;You're in!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;subtitle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isShared&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Don't miss out! Sign up to register and join &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Add the event to your calendar and invite your friends to join you at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thats-a-wrap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  That’s a wrap!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget — if you want to make sure your Open Graph images work as expected — you’ll need to deploy your application to a live URL. Vercel makes it really easy to go live with your Next.js application in just a few seconds. &lt;a href="https://vercel.com/signup"&gt;Sign up to Vercel&lt;/a&gt; and connect your project via GitHub — and you’re away! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudinary is pretty magical, and I can’t wait to explore its possibilities even further. What’s more, I’m excited to build similar apps in the future for different events I might run for my Discord and streaming community. If you’d like to explore the code demonstrated in this post, &lt;a href="https://github.com/whitep4nth3r/ticket-app-demo"&gt;check out the GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; here (it contains zero CSS so go wild with your designs!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, make sure to sign up to &lt;a href="https://www.contentful.com/fast-forward"&gt;Fast Forward 2021&lt;/a&gt; to receive your free ticket! We’ve got three days of events dedicated to those building the next generation of digital experiences, from developers to architects, engineers, creatives and technology enthusiasts alike. Don’t forget to share your ticket on social media — it’ll be even more fun now you know how it works! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Div in Center using only 2 lines of  CSS code |  part-2</title>
      <author>Shubham Jadhav</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 05:52:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dev_shubham/div-in-center-using-only-2-lines-of-css-code-part-2-5hd0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dev_shubham/div-in-center-using-only-2-lines-of-css-code-part-2-5hd0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Coders... &lt;br&gt;
  Today, I am showing you how to put an empty div in center in just Two lines of css code. &lt;br&gt;
  So, let's begin our second part of this series. Let's build... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always we need a code editor ,a html file and css file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we make a empty div and give a 'box' as class name. As following &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4LetUp5O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qegvk4nkn3wrnnhjt3ms.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4LetUp5O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qegvk4nkn3wrnnhjt3ms.jpg" alt="empty div code"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, make a div visible by add following code in our css file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6n2pPsY6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3qo7c7be1v64fvm5jr6v.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6n2pPsY6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3qo7c7be1v64fvm5jr6v.jpg" alt="box css code"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now add two magical code to put our div in center of page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iKe-oNEl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5qw37rdn6loymdn2vguh.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iKe-oNEl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5qw37rdn6loymdn2vguh.jpg" alt="magical code"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this code in body tag but you can add any other parent element. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Hope you guys this code is &lt;br&gt;
   helpful for you,and please &lt;br&gt;
   like and give some feedback &lt;br&gt;
   for more improvement. &lt;br&gt;
🙏 Thank you for reading...&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the 1st video in the Descriptive Statistics playlist. This is an introduction to Descriptive Statistics in a very simple manner.We will discuss the following&lt;br&gt;
💎 Mean , Median , Mode&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
💎 Variance and Standard Deviation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
💎 Covariance and Correlation &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed creating this video and hope all of you will like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common telephonic interview questions - Section 1</title>
      <author>NITESH TALIYAN</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 03:58:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/niteshtaliyan/common-telephonic-interview-questions-section-1-2m9d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/niteshtaliyan/common-telephonic-interview-questions-section-1-2m9d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several companies have a phone interview round where they ask you questions from your resume as well as some quick technical trivia questions. I have tried to compile a list of these questions. This should also be helpful to you if you are new to tech or would like to brush over some concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lqL4mv7E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fx4b909zr4akg2gy44zm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lqL4mv7E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fx4b909zr4akg2gy44zm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-threads-vs-processes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. Threads vs processes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt; is an instance of a program, and Thread is a subset of the process. Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution.&lt;br&gt;
 a). Threads (of the same process) run in shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces. Hence, threads have their own stack(local variables) but share the same heap. Processes have separate stack and heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b). Threads can efficiently communicate by their shared memory. They can communicate using objects stored in the heap, where each thread has access to the same object at the same memory location. Processes use Inter-process Communication(IPC) and the OS has to be involved.&lt;br&gt;
 c). Threads take less time to create and terminate than processes because they consume fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d). On a uni-processor system, a thread scheduling algorithm is applied and the processor is scheduled to run each thread one at a time. Hence threads are concurrent and not parallel per processor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O02VHA5F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lbfyxflp2qit3z8vjfpg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O02VHA5F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lbfyxflp2qit3z8vjfpg.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-data-races"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Data races:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A data race is a situation that occurs when multiple threads are running the same program and 2 or more threads get access to the same shared variable, at the same time. It leads to unpredictable outputs and can cause problems sometimes when the result is undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideal scenario: We want to increment the value of a variable whose initial value is 0, by 1, twice, and there are 2 threads doing this for us. The final result should be the value of the variable becomes 2.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eXUWOiFp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pgevkndzpszfb8k3x12o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eXUWOiFp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pgevkndzpszfb8k3x12o.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both threads read the original value and then rewrite it, the final result will be wrong, and this could be a major bug in our program.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gfLqY2ZC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7j2gob8gkb2npswjiy62.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gfLqY2ZC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7j2gob8gkb2npswjiy62.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data races can be prevented by introducing a lock. That way, when one thread accesses the variable for updating its value, the variable’s access will be locked until that thread completes its operation. Hence, the other thread will have to “wait” and will not be able to access, read or change the variable's value before the first thread has finished updating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the locks are not used carefully, they can lead to a deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-deadlock"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Deadlock:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a situation where two or more threads are blocked permanently because they are waiting for each other. It causes the threads to hang, and could potentially lead the entire process to hang as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-four-pillars-of-objectoriented-programming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-pie-abstraction-polymorphism-inheritance-encapsulation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Pie: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-abstraction-abstract-classes-and-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A: Abstraction: Abstract classes and methods
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i). You can remember what this means by the word “abstract” being a part of the word Abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii). Used to hide complex details from the user, enabling user to use a program or implement more complex code on top, without worrying/knowing about the complexities involved with the current program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iii). It is achieved by using abstract classes and methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iv). An abstract class is a class where we can declare abstract methods. An abstract method is a method without a body, with just the name and no implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v). A classic example is an abstract Shape class with an abstract Area method. The children of this class (Circle, Triangle, etc) will have different ways of implementing this area method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#p-polymorphism-overriding-and-overloading"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  P: Polymorphism: Overriding and OverLoading
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can remember this by the word “poly” which means many in Greek. The same method can have “many” forms in different subclasses, by using overriding and overloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-inheritance-extends-parent-and-child-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I: Inheritance: extends, parent and child class
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can remember this by keeping in mind that you inherit your parents’ features like hair and eye color etc. Similarly, inheritance is the process through which a child class receives or inherits the properties of its parent class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “extends” keyword is used to inherit the properties of any superclass ( parent class) by a child class ( subclass ). This helps in reusability, reduces code length and prevents the user from writing the same code over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#e-encapsulation-getters-and-setters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  E: Encapsulation: Getters and Setters
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can remember this by correlating the word encapsulation with “encapsulating” or wrapping up methods and variables together and hence hiding data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurs when you declare variables as private and has getters and setters to provide access to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps in controlling what is stored in the fields of our class, having restrictions as well as making certain elements read-only or write-only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-why-do-we-need-oops-object-oriented-programming-system-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Why do we need OOPS ( Object Oriented Programming System) ?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object-Oriented Programming languages are the ones that use the concept of “objects” in programming. For answering this question, you can first say OOPs help in effective and easily manageable problem-solving. They make complex code more understandable and easy to maintain. You can then talk about the concepts of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object: Anything that represents a real-life entity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class: Blueprint of an object&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods: A few lines of code clumped together that perform some task, and they may or may not take in input and provide the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then discuss the four pillars mentioned above with their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be enough to show that you have a thorough understanding of Object-Oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it for part 1! Let me know if you find it helpful, and connect with me on my social sites for questions or blog topic suggestions. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python Data Visualization - Atlanta Crime Data (Part 2)</title>
      <author>Nicholas Oxford</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 03:07:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nicholasoxford/python-data-visualization-atlanta-crime-data-part-2-h1c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nicholasoxford/python-data-visualization-atlanta-crime-data-part-2-h1c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@nicholasoxford/learning-python-mapping-atl-crime-data-935d2406265b"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, we made a simple, 2 layer plot of Atlanta crime day in 2021. This was done by importing crime data from a CSV, a shapefile to represent Atlanta roads, and creating an axis plot instance. While we were able to create impressive graphics in about 25 lines of code, the data isn't revealing anything. Check out my notebook &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11zPSOeWKWz-zKufPfctRwHpORysk9a35?usp=sharing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tkyOlsAQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hj0l812we5j84t1i9tfk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tkyOlsAQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hj0l812we5j84t1i9tfk.png" alt="Atlanta Crime Data Map Made In Python"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there more crime this year than last? How can we intuitively use code to find the answers? Let's start by importing the 2020 crime data. Right off the bat, we can think about how our 2021 data is incomplete. It's currently September 9th, 2021 so we are just over 2/3rds of the way through the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to easily filter your table data is to set a new index. Naturally, your index with be an integer that increases by one. Here we are going to use the occur_date as each rows index. What we also need to do is convert the string into a type datetime. This allows us to filter out or data by date, easily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://github.com/nicholasoxford/pythonViz/blob/main/2020-old.csv?raw=true"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"occur_date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"2020-09-10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are using google collab, which you should, you will see a printout of the data frame. If you comment out the filter line, &lt;code&gt;df2020 = df2020[(df2020.index &amp;lt; "2020-09-10")]&lt;/code&gt;, you will see the entire scope of the file. You'll also notice it only goes to September 30th. The rest of the data is another CSV, titled CRIME-2020. In the read_csv line, switch out the file name at the end for the rest of the years data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in part 1, we need to transform this data frame into a geoDataFrame using geoPandas. Now that we are moving along in our python career, let's create a reusable function. We could just copy and paste, but I have a feeling this isn't the last time we are going to need to transform the dataframe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dfGeoTransfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;gpd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GeoDataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EPSG:4326"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'long'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'lat'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;geo_df20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dfGeoTransfer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;geo_df20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see we combined the two lines into a longer return statement. You could keep it two, I think it's up to you really. Don't shoot me. Finally, we set the return value of the function, a geoDataFrame, to a new variable called geo_df20. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to filter our data for the longitude and latitude of our steet plot. We can't do the same plot.xlim trick we did last time. While we are creating this filtering method, I think we should create an all-encompassing method. Our goal with this function is that it takes a link to a CSV and returns a geoDataFrame with the proper filtering and transformation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;prepareGeoDataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"occur_date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"2020-09-10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"long"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;84.425&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;filter2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"long"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;84.35&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;filter3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lat"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;33.745&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;filter4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lat"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;33.813&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;gpd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GeoDataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"EPSG:4326"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'long'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'lat'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To do a quick spot check of the data let's put the plots side by side. There is a neat trick using plot axes instances where you define how many rows / columns and it returns an array of axes instances. I think the code just kinda makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's also pass in our 2021 data through our &lt;code&gt;prepareGeoDataFarame&lt;/code&gt; function. Making sure our data is structured the same will help going forward. Plus, now all we have to do is pass in a URL and the hard work is done for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keen-eyed among you will have noticed one issue with our code above. If we pass in 2021 data, we basically will get back nothing. I made a quick and easy if statement to handle this situation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"occur_date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"2020-09-10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"2021-09-10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"long"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;84.425&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I said before we can't use the xlim and ylim methods, this is because we will be plotting our graphs side by side. To do this we will start the same, except we will add two properties to our subplots. Rows and columns. Now subplots will return an array of axes instances. To be clear, we will use the same street map for both, just different csv's. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our new function, prepareGeoDataFrame, all we need is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;street_map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gpd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/content/drive/MyDrive/GC_Roads/GC_RD_GA/Roads_Atlanta_GA.shp'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;geo_df20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prepareGeoDataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://github.com/nicholasoxford/pythonViz/blob/main/2020-old.csv?raw=true"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;geo_df21&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prepareGeoDataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://github.com/nicholasoxford/pythonViz/blob/main/COBRA-2021%203.csv?raw=true"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nrows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ncols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;figsize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#plot both streetmap and and long/lat points
# fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,15))
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;geo_df21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UC2_Literal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;legend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;markersize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;street_map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_crs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4326&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'grey'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;geo_df20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UC2_Literal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;legend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;markersize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;street_map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_crs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4326&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'grey'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tight_layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and we get &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X1ztI1pg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sgt28uxqhz05uo1tql0j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X1ztI1pg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sgt28uxqhz05uo1tql0j.png" alt="2020 vs 2021 Atlanta crime"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this isn't ideal, the colors don't line up for example. However, we have simplified our code, and we have a multiple-column graph instance. You as a coder should also have a much better understanding of defining a function and if statements. Pandas and geoPandas makes it so easy. I feel like this would be almost impossible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check back in part 3 where we do statistical analysis and break it down by crime.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This series is going to be my attempt to build a very basic neural network in C++ from scratch. All the information from this series can be found in the book, &lt;code&gt;C++ Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic by Valluru B. Rao&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-quick-word"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Quick word
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This first post in the series is on chapter one and there will be no actual creation of a neural network. Instead we will try to get a solid understanding of basic terminology used when creating a neural network. With that being said, let us move on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#neural-network"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Neural network
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A neural network is a computational structure inspired by the study of biological neural processing. There many types of neural networks but we are going to start on the &lt;code&gt;layered feed-forward&lt;/code&gt; type of neural network. Which is actually one of the simplest forms of neural networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#layered-feedforward"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Layered feed-forward
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not surprisingly a layered feed-forward network has layers, or rather subgroups of processing elements. A layer of processing elements makes independent computations on data that it receives and passes the results to another layer and so on until a subgroup of one or more processing elements determines the output for the network. Each processing element makes its computation based upon base upon a weighted sum of inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So basically, there are layers and each layer is full of &lt;code&gt;processing elements&lt;/code&gt; that each make independent computations on data and passes the results to the next layer. Until the data goes through the last layer, the output layer and outputs our result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#image-of-feedforward-network"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Image of feed-forward network
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The classic image on a feed-forward network can be found &lt;a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/feed-forward-neural-network"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; and it is usually what is shown when we think of neural nets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output-of-a-neuron"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output of a Neuron
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The output of a neuron (processing element) in a neural network is a &lt;code&gt;weighted&lt;/code&gt; sum of its inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-price-is-right-cash-register-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example: Price is Right cash register game
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are unfamiliar with the &lt;code&gt;Price is Right&lt;/code&gt;, no worries, the example will still make sense. In the cash register game on the Price is Right a few products are described, their prices are unknown to the contestant and the contestant has to decide how many units of each items they would like to buy. The price of that product is revealed and the amount is totalled up on the cash register. If the amount doesn't go above a certain amount, then the contestant wins a prize. The contest must be careful so that the total price does not exceed some nominal value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-explained"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example: explained
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The products are the neurons in the input layer with its input being the unit price of that product. The cash register is a single neuron in the output layer. The only connections in the network are between each neuron(products) in the input layer and the output neuron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contestant actually determines these connections, because when the contestant says they want 5 of a particular product. The contestant is assigning a weight(more on weight later) of 5 to the connection between that product and the cash register. The bill of the purchases by the contestant is nothing but the weighted sum of the unit prices of the different products offered. For the items that the contestant does no choose to purchase, the implicit weight assigned is 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weights"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weights
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weights used on connections between different layers have much significance in the working of the neural network and the characterization of a network. The following actions are possible in a neural network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Start with one set of weights and run the network(no training)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Start with one set of weights, run the network and modify some or all of the weights, and run the network again with the new set of weights. Repeat this process until some predetermined goal is met(training).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#training"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Training
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the output may not be what we expected, the weights may need to be altered. Some rule then needs to be applied to determine updating the weights, this is called training. Adjusting the weights on each connection between each node until we get a desired result is what we do to train our neural network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#feedback"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Feedback
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wish to train a network so it can recognize or identify some predetermined pattern, or evaluate some function values for given arguments. It would be important to have information fed back from the output neurons to neurons in some layer before that, to enable further processing and adjusting of weights on the connections. Such feedback can be to the input layer or a layer between the input and output layer, called  the &lt;code&gt;hidden layer&lt;/code&gt;. What is fed back is usually the error in the output, modified appropriately accordingly to some specification. The process of feedback continues through the subsequent cycles of operation of the neural network and ceases when the training is completed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#noise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Noise
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noise is deviation from the actual. A dataset used to train a neural network may have some noise in it, or an image may have random specks in it. The response of the neural network to noise is an important factor in determining its suitability to a given application. We may want to introduce noise intentionally in training to find out if the network can learn in the presence of noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#neural-network-construction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Neural Network Construction
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 3 aspects to the construction of a neural network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2) Encoding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3) Recall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This relates to how may layers the network should contain. Structure also encompasses how their interconnections are made between neurons in the network and what their functions are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encoding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encoding
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encoding refers to the paradigm used for the determination of  and changing of weights on the connections between neurons. In the case of the &lt;code&gt;Layered feed-forward&lt;/code&gt; network, we might initially define weights at random. But then through the process of training, we can update the weights. After we are finished training we are finished with encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recall"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Recall
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recall refers to getting an expected output for a given input. If the same input as before is presented to the network, the same corresponding output as before should result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Encoding&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Recall&lt;/code&gt; are very important because they essentially distinguish between different neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Convenient and useful techniques to reduce the lines of code and pace up your Dev Work!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our daily tasks, we get to write functions such as sorting, searching, finding unique values, passing parameters, swapping values etc, so here I present my list of shorthand techniques to write all of them as a Pro!✌🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WgxQe1g9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vh2m04o3fgw3a6i8bzha.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Increase Your Performance" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ftNfvGUp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WgxQe1g9--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vh2m04o3fgw3a6i8bzha.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is truly an awesome language💛 to learn and work with. And there can be more than one approach to reach to the same solution for given problem. In this article, we will discuss only the quickest ones.🚀&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches will definitely help you in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing the number of LOC(lines of code),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Competitions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hackathons or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other time bound tasks.⏱&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these JavaScript Hacks uses techniques from ECMAScript6(ES2015) onwards, though the latest version is ECMAScript11(ES2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All below tricks have been tested on the Console of Google Chrome. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
