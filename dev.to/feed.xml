      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you're promoted you feel you're the king of the world. You worked your ass off. You deserved it, you deserved your new title, your hopefully hefty raise. Of course, you'd have deserved just any raise, right?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, the joy you felt over your promotion. The problem is that this feeling fades soon. Probably it's not even a problem, as you should not define who you are based on your previous achievements. The real problem is that often your confidence fades and without it, it'll be hard to progress further, or even just to feel fulfilled in your current role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see from where your confidence comes from, how it helps you to progress then how it fades because of that progress. Finally, we see how you can regain your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#five-sources-of-confidence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Five sources of confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's explore 5 essential sources of confidence and how not to let them dry up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-things-done"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get things done
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people claim that in order to achieve something, you must be confident. These people are already confident, but they forget that it was not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence doesn't come out of the blue. That is called ego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence is the outcome of action. Get things done, no matter how small they are, but be consistent and you'll build up your confidence fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#follow-through"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Follow through
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting things done is often mentioned in relation to small tasks. If something would not take more than 2 minutes to complete, just do it, do it now. That's one of the foundational rules of &lt;em&gt;getting things done&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helps gain some confidence. Confidence that is needed to follow through with more complex tasks. Tasks that cannot simply be get done. Projects that require that you break them down into smaller chunks. Into pieces that will require you to work on them every day or so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing so, by completing some big projects you had in mind, you'll further boost your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-on-your-gains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus on your gains
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to improve something, you have to measure it. You cannot improve your finances if you don't know in detail your financial situation. You cannot prepare well for an exam if you don't know where your weaknesses are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must monitor your progress and use the insights to adjust your direction. But it's not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Dan Sullivan, the world-class business coach and Dr. Benjamin Hardy organizational psychologist explained in their book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401964362/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=sandordargo-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1401964362&amp;amp;linkId=28504ced4262bc4ef3d8095a8b023357"&gt;The Gap And The Gain&lt;/a&gt;, you have to focus on how much you progressed, not on how far you are from your ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll always find people who are still further away from you and it feels daunting. You shouldn't compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to your past self, focus on how long you came, how much you improved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a surefire way to boost your confidence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-something-outside-your-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do something outside your work!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, work is important, but your life is - hopefully - more than that. You might have a family, a hobby, a passion...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does that relate to your career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many different ways, but let's focus on confidence. Even if confidence in one area cannot be directly translated to confidence in another, still, it has an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is a complex system. If you're improving one area of your life, it will affect all the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it's important to do something outside of work that you enjoy, that you are good at, and that you can use as a source of inspiration, a source of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be raising your kid, making your home beautiful, doing some sports, baking. Whatever you truly care about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving results in that area will boost your confidence in every area of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visualize-your-success"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Visualize your success
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Phelps, one of the most successful swimmers ever - like other successful sportspeople - had a thorough pre-race routine. Part of it was closing his eyes and visualizing himself during the race. He saw himself from the outside, he saw himself swimming and winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helped him to relax, to be less anxious and more confident. After all, winning just became something he already saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a world-class swimmer to follow similar habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start into a complex venture, close your eyes and visualize yourself succeeding at it. Don't be shallow, focus on the details. It will both help you prepare, think about things you might have forgotten otherwise and it will also grow your confidence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#confidence-leads-to-more-results"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Confidence leads to more results
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increased level of confidence you earned, you will reap many benefits in your life, including better performance, healthier relationships, openness to try new things and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better performance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it's worth emphasizing that confidence is not a prerequisite of action, it's a byproduct! By taking action, by performing well, you'll gain confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But by gaining confidence, you'll perform even better, you'll take more action. It's an upward spiral. Or if you prefer, it's like &lt;a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2020/12/26/good-to-great-by-jim-collins#let-the-flywheel-turn"&gt;letting the flywheel turn&lt;/a&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few actions, earning the first few bits of confidence is difficult, but once the momentum builds up, you're becoming unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#healthy-relationships"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Healthy relationships
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your confidence will also improve your relationships in two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you'll stop comparing yourself to others, you'll stop being jelaous, therefore you can be happier both for others' successes and for your own as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, your confidence originates from your within, you don't have to rely on others. If you feel that others just try to bring you down, they just try to hold you back, you'll be able to walk away more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#openness-to-try-new-things"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Openness to try new things
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are confident, when you believe in yourself, you feel free to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This openness will not just manifest itself at work, but in your personal life as well. Remember, the different parts of life constitute a system. If you improve one part, the rest will also improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confident person is an open person. Open to think about new ideas, open to try himself in new circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resilience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resilience
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence will also make you more resilient. Imagine that you fail with one of your projects. Not just a little, but you fail hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had no confidence, it puts you down. Probably you were already down, so it just pushes you downward in the spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you are confident, you know that you cannot fail. You either win or you learn. You'll bounce back, you'll be even more capable than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-might-lose-your-confidence-after-a-big-win-and-its-okay"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You might lose your confidence after a big win and it's okay
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you drink from all the wells of confidence every morning, even if you enjoy all the benefits of being confident, sometimes you'll lose your spirit. You'll feel alone. You'll be afraid. You won't understand what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#promotion-leads-to-incompetence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Promotion leads to incompetence
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't worry. You're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common feeling a bit after a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how people get promoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do a great job as a software developer and you might become a tech lead. Or an engineering manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never learnt it. It will be difficult. You might even fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most businesses promote people according to the Peter principle. People will be promoted to new positions - to positions that require a different skillset - until they will reach a position where they don't perform well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of your confidence came from successes that you achieved in your previous position. Those are gone. They are irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have less to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#promotions-as-acknowledgement-are-better"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Promotions as acknowledgement are better
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I found a good practice that you have to perform in your new role for some time before you can officially be promoted. If you want to become a senior engineer, if you want to become a staff engineer, you have to perform tasks that a senior or a staff engineer would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that it can seem unjust to work in a higher position without the tile or the financial rewards, but it's still beneficial not only for your employer in terms of better judgement but also for you to be a bit stressed about your promotion and more confident on how well you can perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-feeling-of-incompetence-should-not-hurt-your-confidence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The feeling of incompetence should not hurt your confidence
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you scroll back to the section about how to gain more confidence, you'll realize that most of the sources are still relevant to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still get small things done. Your activities outside your job are still there. You already gained a lot that you can focus on. And while probably following through big projects will still have to wait a bit, you can already visualize those successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't let new circumstances make you feel incompetent, don't let the new incompetence take away your confidence. You have already come far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regain-your-confidence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regain your confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can you do if despite what we discussed, you still lose your confidence after the promotion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accept-you-cannot-know-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accept you cannot know everything
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, you have to do a mental shift. You have to accept that you do not, you cannot know everything but you can always learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to accept that you'll meet less experienced people who can do things that you cannot do. You should not be afraid of them taking over your role, you deserved your promotion. Not because you know everything and everything better than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't do the mental shift, you'll not focus on growing, you'll not focus on getting better, but instead, you'll spend most of your energy on defending your position, building a silo around yourself so that you feel less threatened by those who are better in some aspects of your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't want that, do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-on-your-strengths"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus on your strengths
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you have to focus on your own strengths and hone those skills further. You might lack some skills that you should improve, but in general, you're better off if you actively seek out the help of more competent people. When you face a problem that goes out of your competency zone, you should not think about how to solve it, but rather about who you can solve it for you. Focus on who, not how as Benjamin P Hardy explained in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401960588/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=sandordargo-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1401960588&amp;amp;linkId=8eb5d38b3b0e0aebdcde3e553463efe4"&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll deliberate you from wanting to know everything and let you focus on what you are great at. There is a reason why not every company produces everything, but only what they are good or even great at. In economics, it's also called having a comparative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do is that you set your next big goal and start working towards them, little by little. Building up your confidence again also relies on other parts of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't let success and others' knowledge discourage you. You don't have to be better at everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be great to live your life in a way that always goes upwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not a realistic expectation, after mountains, there are valleys. Yet, it doesn't mean that whenever you go down into a valley, you should lose your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw that there are many sources of confidence, therefore if you feel less comfortable in one area of your life, you should not lose it all, we should still be able to gain force from the other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about what activities make you more confident and how you can do more of those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connect-deeper"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connect deeper
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>The problem with code screenshots and how to fix it</title>
      <author>Savvas Stephanides</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:03:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/savvasstephnds/the-problem-with-code-screenshots-and-how-to-fix-it-2ka0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/savvasstephnds/the-problem-with-code-screenshots-and-how-to-fix-it-2ka0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you decided to write a tutorial about a topic you know extremely well. You are very familiar with the topic, so much so that you know all the code like the backside of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial has a lot of code, and you need it to look good! So you either screenshot your code editor which colours your code, or you use a tool like &lt;a href="https://carbon.now.sh/"&gt;Carbon&lt;/a&gt; to generate some great-looking code snippets as PNGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rSjQPSLU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6pihc956vh47hm9dh8eu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rSjQPSLU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6pihc956vh47hm9dh8eu.png" alt="" width="880" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome as now you can get away from using bland, ugly code snippets.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log("Hi!")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem(s)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pasting a picture or screenshot of code might look good on your blog, it presents 2 major issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-your-users-cant-copy-your-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Your users can't copy your code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're running into a problem while coding. You search on Google and stumble upon a great tutorial. Clear and concise explanations with code examples. You want to try the code for yourself to see if it's fit for your purpose, but to your frustration and horror, the code you've been reading is actually &lt;em&gt;a screenshot&lt;/em&gt;. How would you feel? You'd rub your temples, or scream at the screen and move away from the article to find something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what your users will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's another, more major issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-code-images-are-inaccessible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Code images are inaccessible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For screen reader users, an image is only as good as its &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text. So what are you going to do? Write the entire code snippet as &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; text? No, you shouldn't. So anyone with a screen reader is unable to read your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to both these problems is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-proper-markdown"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use proper Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to use proper Markdown for code snippets. So if you're adding code, you should use this syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;```
console.log("Hi!")
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blogging platforms like DevTo and Hashnode have excellent code snippet colouring support:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hi!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if you just include the language next to your top backticks (`), then they should be automatically coloured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;```javascript
console.log("Hi!")
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what if I'm writing on my own blog?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-highlightjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use HighlightJS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make your code look beautiful on your own website or blog, without the need for inaccessible screenshots or Carbon images, you can use Javascript libraries like &lt;a href="https://highlightjs.org/"&gt;HighlightJS&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a &lt;a href="https://savvas.me/tips/beautiful-code"&gt;tutorial to get started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work hard on your blog and you want everything, including your code to look great! Code snippets as images or screenshots might sound like the easy way towards this but you also need to think of your visitors. Visitors who would want to copy your code for later use and users who are only able to read your posts using screen readers. Be inclusive. Be human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Webhook vs APIs</title>
      <author>Suspir0n</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:45:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/suspir0n/webhook-vs-apis-50h0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/suspir0n/webhook-vs-apis-50h0</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quer-saber-o-que-%C3%A9-um-webhook-e-como-funciona"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quer saber o que é um webhook e como funciona?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a facilidade e a praticidade que você terá usando o webhook, neste artigo iremos descrever o que webhook, como funciona e de bônus deixaremos um exemplo simples e prático usando python mas também pode ser utilizado em outras linguagens, deixarei referencias em outras linguagens para poder ajudar no seu estudo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#o-que-%C3%A9-webhook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  O que é Webhook?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De acordo com o blog do &lt;a href="https://blog.vindi.com.br/o-que-sao-webhooks/"&gt;Vindi&lt;/a&gt; "Webhook é uma forma de recebimento de informações, passadas quando um evento acontece. Dessa forma, o webhook, na prática, é a forma de receber informações entre dois sistemas de uma forma passiva. Além disso, o webhook (também conhecido como retorno de chamada web ou HTTP e, ainda, impulso API) é uma maneira prática para um app ou sistema fornecer outras aplicações com informações em tempo real. Da mesma forma, ele fornece dados para outros aplicativos, e são muito eficientes tanto para o prestador de serviço, como para o consumidor."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplificando, webhooks são eventos que acionam uma ação.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bLQi7irI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n5c64liu91rcqqha8zgk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bLQi7irI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n5c64liu91rcqqha8zgk.png" alt="webhook em ação" width="880" height="704"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#como-funciona-webhook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Como funciona Webhook?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Então, supondo que você esteja criando um bot para o telegram, e você acaba criando uma API para isso, nesta API você tem uma rota que executa uma determinada ação do bot, com isso você precisa fazer o set Webhook na API do telegram para que quando for requisitado aquele Webhook, ele ira acionar a ação daquele determinado evento. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wqofmdKz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/usghu9bqpam8tp76s8ex.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wqofmdKz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/usghu9bqpam8tp76s8ex.png" alt="webhook vs API" width="720" height="254"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observando está imagem acima, você percebe que Webhook e APIs são duas comunicações totalmente diferente, enquanto a API ele pega os dados de um servidor, o Webhook puxa os seus dados. APIs estão em constante votação para obter as assinaturas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aOuCegze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mp0x19fu4fx8og64677b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aOuCegze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mp0x19fu4fx8og64677b.png" alt="Diferença de votação" width="720" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#webhook-na-pr%C3%A1tica"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Webhook, na prática
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste exemplo prático iremos utilizar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/"&gt;Framework Flask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vamos começar criando um servidor para receber o webhook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7kmyCjR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sk5t6qhol6xdfs29xubn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V7kmyCjR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sk5t6qhol6xdfs29xubn.png" alt="Servidor em Flask" width="880" height="816"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste código, você observa que criamos apenas uma rota chamada '/webhook' do método do tipo 'POST', logo a nossa rota irá permitir requisição com este método. Com isso basta você executar dois comandos, o primeiro para escrever seu server como uma variável de ambiente e o outro para executar o server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No windows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set FLASK_APP='nomedoseuarquivo'.py&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flask run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Linux:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;export FLASK_APP='nomedoseuarquivo'.py&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flask run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Após você ter criado um server, vamos agora criar um arquivo onde você irar enviar o seu webhook, o código ficaria desta forma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NbYwdbpt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kc0umm97by6y0bs97ef7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NbYwdbpt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kc0umm97by6y0bs97ef7.png" alt="Send Webhooks" width="880" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste código, fizemos um exemplo de requisição, fazendo o envio do nosso webhook, finalizando nosso exemplo nesta etapa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repare que neste exemplo, usamos localhost, caso você deseje aplicar esses conhecimentos utilizando a API do telegram, por exemplo, você pode usar o &lt;a href="https://ngrok.com/docs"&gt;ngrok&lt;/a&gt;, pois o telegram não aceita localhost, então você pode utilizar o ngrok para isso, sendo que ele serve apenas para testar sua aplicação, não para ir em produção. Decorrerei sobre o ngrok em outro artigo, deixarei o link logo abaixo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Este foi o &lt;b&gt;diário de bordo #06&lt;/b&gt; vamos nos despedindo por aqui. Voltaremos com mais um diário de bordo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan Scheffler: Hello and welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaunchiesShow"&gt;Launchies&lt;/a&gt;, proudly brought to you by New Relic's Developer Relations team, &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;The Relicans&lt;/a&gt;. The Launchies podcast is about supporting new developers and telling their stories and helping you make the next step in what we certainly hope is a very long and healthy career in software. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="//developer.newrelic.com/podcasts"&gt;developer.newrelic.com/podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. We're so glad you're here. Enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha Blake: Hello and welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Launchies"&gt;Launchies&lt;/a&gt;, the podcast for early-career developers and developers with non-traditional backgrounds. My name is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AishaBlake"&gt;Aisha Blake&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm a Senior Developer Relations Engineer at &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com/"&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt;. Today I'm your host, and I am here with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annetgriffin"&gt;Anne T. Griffin&lt;/a&gt;. She's a manager of both people and products, an expert in AI and blockchain as well as an accomplished speaker. Welcome and thank you so much for being here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne Griffin: I'm super thrilled to be here. And I really love what this podcast is about because you said some things where I'm like, wow, that makes me feel really great about myself. I do all those things. But I'm like; I started off not in that place. And before this, we were talking a little bit about what my first job out of college was like and that kind of thing. And I just really want to be on this podcast and be able to speak to those people who are experiencing either out of bootcamp, or however else, or out of college, or any other way that they're getting into development or tech and hopefully be able to help some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Awesome. I really, really appreciate that. So let's maybe start off with a little bit of that feeling of what it's like to start out in the industry without that confidence of feeling like I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm about, and I have something to offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah. So the first job out of college, I was the only woman in that specific office. For a while, I was the only black person, which for those of you who are listening to this, you can't see me; I'm very ethnically ambiguous looking. So if I'm the only black person in your office, you have a very big problem. I just remember being like, okay, I'm the only one who looks like this, that kind of thing. I stood out, and I felt pressure like, oh my God, I have to be really good and all this other stuff. And also feeling like there was also a double standard for me about...I felt like when other people work together; it felt like, oh, this is just like bros hanging out talking. But when I asked for help, it felt like there was some deficiency in me and my knowledge and how I solve problems. And some of that was maybe slightly in my own head. And some of that was also projected onto me in the way people reacted when I did ask for help, which now I'm in a place where I know okay; these were super toxic situations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think a lot of people when they're starting out, you have that like, oh my gosh, I'm a little anxious because I haven't done this before. But especially when you're in a situation where you stand out because you come from a non-traditional background or because of who you are, how you look, or other things, it is very nerve-wracking because people, as much as they like to think that they're not biased, respond to you differently and have different standards for your work or how you ask for help when you ask for help. And it can be nerve-wracking, and it becomes like trauma, whether it's a minor level or a major level that you end up carrying into your next job as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: That's such a huge reason why I think it's important for people to, as early as possible, try to find community. Because I've heard that so many times where someone will describe a situation that's going on at work and meanwhile, I'm on the other side of the computer horrified like, no, no, no, they should not be treating you this way. This is not how we do things. And someone who doesn't have the experience or doesn't feel like they have the power even to say something when they're in that situation, it's hard for some people to recognize that they have options and that that's not something that they have to put up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah, exactly. There's this saying about...I can't remember how it's worded, so; please forgive me if it's not going to be eloquent. But the thing is that one of the worst things you can do it's like you give up your own power by thinking you don't have any. And it's this terrible thing where it's like believing that you don't have any power in the situation like, oh, I can't leave this job because I've been here less than a year, or I can't stand up to this person because they're so and so's manager and dah, dah, dah. And obviously, there are situations where you're like, this is going to make my life hell, and I don't want to deal with that. But thinking that I don't have the option to start looking for a job somewhere else, or I don't have the option to transfer to another team or decide, maybe I don't want to do this thing. I don't want to explore a different part of tech. And we give that away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think there are jobs where I stayed longer than I should have, especially at that first job I got out of college. I stayed in that job as long as I did because I thought, well, it's a recession, and what are the options I have? And how bad will it look if I didn't even make it a year in the first job I got out of college? And now I see people changing jobs. I've seen people in this pandemic who have changed jobs two or three times, whether it's because they were in toxic work environments or because of layoffs. And people will ask about it. But it's really not the same where it's like, oh, you're never going to get a good job at one of these amazing companies. It's not this thing that's like a death sentence for your career. And I used to see it that way, and I didn't have a community to talk about it with. So I just internalized all these thoughts on my own and just suffered in silence and in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: So how would you recommend folks begin to look for that community? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: So obviously, we're in a pandemic. So in person, if you're not comfortable, I'll say I'm not comfortable doing things in person right now. Definitely online; whether it's different types of Twitter communities, there are different ones. I'm part of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BlackTechTwitter&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;#BlackTechTwitter&lt;/a&gt;, which is amazing. There are other ones for Latinx people. There are ones for just...I don't think there's a hashtag for it, but there's this group of people where I consider them my sensitive tech community where we all have the same thoughts and feelings that like, I would say maybe the people who are stereotypical tech bros are like, no, you got to grind harder and do this, and this doesn't matter. And it's legal, so who cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's what I call my sensitive tech community and people who are more like you whether you find it on Twitter. There's this amazing group I'm in, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/scbwit/"&gt;Sista Circle: Black Women in Tech&lt;/a&gt;, that I'm in on Facebook. They also have a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13603961/"&gt;LinkedIn community&lt;/a&gt; for those who aren't on Facebook. That is really amazing. Basically, there are tons of Slack communities I'm in, which also all these communities I'm mentioning you don't have to find...obviously, everyone here is from different communities. Find the ones that make sense for you and build there. Because the thing is, it's not just like these are the people that are going to tell you, this is normal, this is not normal. These are also going to be the people who help you find your next job if you are in a situation where you need to exit a toxic situation. My current job, I got this because of a Slack group. I didn't know about this job until Slack and someone referred me. And I met my current manager, and we hit it off, and I've been working there almost two and a half years now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Wow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: And I have a manager who's so supportive. We share a lot of the same values, which I'm like, I've had so many bad managers at this point or at least very mediocre managers that I'm just like, oh my gosh, it's such a relief to not have to fear all the things you fear when you have a bad manager. And so building that community is really vital for your full career but also early in your career because you need someone to tell you, "That's not okay. You shouldn't have to do that." Or like, "This is what you should do in this situation." Or, "You can do that, but here are some things to think about repercussions. I'm not saying you shouldn't do that, but you might decide to handle it in a different way than you originally were thinking about doing it. And so those are things where building an online community is really important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're in a place where you do it in-person or whenever we get to a post-pandemic world, hopefully, meetups are great. But I recommend going to meetups that have a vibe that you are like; I would maybe go to this even if this wasn't about tech. Because I found that when I went to tech meetups that were like, this is the best in mobile development in New York City, they were really cool things. And I never spoke to anyone that I took their business card or that took my business card like ever again, not intentionally; there just wasn't anything in common. So it felt weird like, hey, I met you once at a meetup. There wasn't really anything to cause follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's this summit in Philly they'd been doing it remote during the pandemic called &lt;a href="http://huetechsummit.com/"&gt;HUE Tech Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where I've met so many amazing women of color at the &lt;a href="http://huetechsummit.com/"&gt;HUE Tech Summit&lt;/a&gt;. And several of those people I've started going there since their first year, and this is their fifth year now. Oh my gosh, I can't deal with how time is passing. But I met so many amazing women that I am friends with to this day. Both people who...there was one where it was before she even became a developer, and now she's pretty much a dev influencer. And there are other people where they are way already rock stars in their career. And if I need help, I can just text them. And I'm like, oh, this is kind of amazing. I didn't ever think I would be in this part of my career where I would have this kind of community and network. And so I would say, like, that's my advice: go to the places where you feel like you're home, and you would hang out with these people even if they weren't in tech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: I love that. Oh my goodness, yes. The thing that I miss most about meetups really is that that's how I found friends. And that's how I think about networking. For a lot of people, I feel like networking is this dirty word. But in my opinion, if you approach it like I'm just out here trying to make some friends who happen to have some overlapping professional interests, it's not only easier, but it comes off as being more authentic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: It's way more authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Yeah. You end up with deeper connections that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: It's way better and also takes a lot of the anxiety out of networking. I remember when I first started to network, I would just go to events that sounded super important. And again, I never stayed in touch with any of those people, and it wasn't intentional. It didn't happen because, in my head, that's how networking went. Because also, I never was really taught how to network in that kind of way, and things that I was actually already doing as networking I didn't see as networking. So I was just like, okay, I'm going to put less focus on that. And so once I started being like, I'm going to actually focus all my energy on going to the things that seem like fun, then it actually completely changed networking for me altogether. And it helps me wake up to just because it's not boring and hyper business-y doesn't mean that it's not networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Exactly. So we've talked about hopefully, in the future, in-person meetups. Twitter as well is absolutely huge. And I know you do a lot of work around helping people to leverage &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; better. Could you talk a little more about that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah. So one of the things that I do especially because…I hate to say this, but it's true where it's as people of color, you could end up in a job for ten years because you love it. Or it could be you have no idea when it's going to be time to go. So you don't know what's going to happen. Like, you get a new manager, or something else happens, or there's some incident. Or we have 2020 happen, and suddenly, people decide that they want to write a thesis on what counts as racism and what doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the thing is partly because earlier in my career, I didn't necessarily always have the support and guidance; I had to be really good at finding new jobs very quickly. And then also living in New York, I freelanced when I first moved here. And there were certain jobs I had where I was like, okay, it's definitely time to go. And so, I learned for myself how to leverage &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; to actually get recruiters to regularly come to me. And it got to a point where I remember I'd get random recruiters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I remember one day I got a recruiter from eBay who reached out to me for a job that was hyper-specific for what I wanted to do in the future. It was like I had made up the job title myself, and I was like, how did this happen? Because I wasn't in a place where I necessarily...it was a product management role that dealt with machine learning. And I was like, okay, I didn't lie about my experience. Because at that point, I was like, I'm interested in machine learning, but I had l zero experience. I hadn't done anything in that space. And I asked the eBay recruiter, "How did you find me?" And they said, "I typed it in product manager New York machine learning into &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. And you were the second person to come up." Mind you; New York City is a big place. I'm pretty sure there's someone who's a product manager who's done machine learning who lives in this city, but I was ranking higher than them. And I was like, oh, that's really interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so over the years, I've done a lot of things and tweaked things and learned, okay, this is how you do this. And so I basically packaged that up into a course I teach called Attract Your Dream Job. It's like part course part coaching where I teach black people and people of color especially. Most of the people I work with are in tech to actually use &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; for themselves and understand the algorithm so that they can get recruiters coming to them. There are times where, even just in this pandemic, where I was getting seven recruiters a day. And I was getting recruiters like Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Amazon. I have a whole list actually that's in my phone of all the companies that are like...I'll say the name brand companies who've hit me up at once or more times, even just in the last year. And I teach that to other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But part of it is really just like, you can get all the recruiters coming to you. But if you're like, I don't believe in myself; I don't have the confidence; you're not going to get the job. And then, if they do give you the job, they're going to sense how insecure you feel, and you're already a person of color. So they're already going to have the markdown. And they're going to pay you crap for something they should probably be paying you like $20,000 to $50,000 more for that job. And so it also addresses your mindset, talks about imposter syndrome. And so we just go through our past career trauma or even just trauma in the job search. Because getting rejected repeatedly is hard, and that's something where I want people to be able to talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I'll be honest, it's very emotional for me and also the people in the course because I've broken down crying talking about some of the things. And I've had people in the course who weren't even saying anything and cry. And then they come to me later, and they're like, "Oh my God, that's literally the exact situation I'm in right now. And I thought I was the only one who's gone through that. And I feel my mental health deteriorating, and it's impacting how I'm performing in interviews." And just knowing they're not alone facing that is such a game-changer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so that's what I do where it's like, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; is like the hey, I can use &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; to get you a new job faster. But on top of getting you the new job faster, it's not just getting a new job faster, but it's also giving you options, so you don't have just one option where you're like, well, I have bills to pay, so I better take it. And then it's also making sure you get paid what you're worth and also helping you address that imposter syndrome and doubt in that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: That's so powerful. That feeling of just being beaten down after a while after you've been searching in order to just sustain yourself has to be life-changing for so many people to, one, recognize that they're not alone in that feeling, and then to actually get some actionable advice on how to work through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Absolutely. And there've been times where I've reached out to some of my students and coached them through...again, I'm not a programmer, but you just coach them through more mindset things to help them get through upcoming programming interviews because I understand it can be intimidating. It can be like, oh, I failed all these other ones. How am I going to get through this one? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what makes it even worse is sometimes you're trying to build community, and you don't realize sometimes the people you initially put in your community, especially if you're in the beginning of your career in tech, are really insecure themselves, and therefore they can't admit that they're struggling. So they're like, "I don't know what you're talking about. I thought this interview was actually super easy, and I did really well." Or like, "Oh, by the way, I got offers from Amazon, and Facebook, and Google, and I'm just choosing." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the thing is, they're never going to talk about what it took for them to get there. They're never going to talk about how their mental health was maybe impacted. They kind of project this like, oh man, I just did five extra hours a week of LeetCode or something. And for some people, their mental health is already hanging on by a string. Five extra hours a week is either detrimental to their mental health, or it's literally not possible if maybe you took a bootcamp and you're working two jobs until you get into a tech job. Sometimes that's not an option for you, and people will make it sound like it's just you. Like, oh, did you just start studying? Or maybe you're just not trying hard enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reality is there are tons of people facing that, and people are too insecure to talk about that it makes them miserable and sad to go through some of these processes. It doesn't make you less good of a programmer, or product manager, designer. But a lot of people are too insecure to admit how it makes them feel. And it makes other people feel like I can't talk about this because it's easy for everyone else but me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Yeah, absolutely. Like I said, to have that space where you're encouraged to say, "Hey, you know what? Actually, I'm not okay. This is really hard, and it's having this effect on me." That's huge. And I just really commend you for creating that for people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah. I think people need that space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Definitely. What's your maybe most common step that you have people take in that situation? What maybe is the most common issue that you see that can be addressed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Again, there's the mindset stuff, and then there's like the hey, you can do this on LinkedIn, and this will help this. But I think there are two things where one is slowing down enough to identify where you are psyching yourself out, where you are actually doing all the work for the enemy. And I'm like, make them do it. Make them say those things, those terrible things you're saying in your head that you think they're going to say. Make them say it. Don't say it to yourself. You have to be focused on what am I great at? Let me focus on that. Here's what I have to bring. Yeah, I might mess up this part, but guess what? There's always going to be someone in the interview that's going to mess something up. I'm still going to show up. I'm going to do great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I've told people like, if you have to do the thing where you create an alter ego for yourself for like this interview self, and this is outside of interview self…And I use this example a lot like Beyoncé created Sasha Fierce as an alter ego. Because she herself is like, "I feel like I'm actually very shy. And I needed this other persona to help me be this amazing diva pop star on stage." And I think a lot of us really know...I mean, even though she considers Sasha Fierce retired, but Sasha Fierce basically birthed the version of Beyoncé we know now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think a lot of us know Beyoncé as a post-Sasha Fierce Beyoncé or Sasha Fierce Beyoncé. And not a lot of us really think about Beyoncé, the homebody who doesn't really want to talk to anybody, period. She just wants to go home and hang out, do regular everyday Beyoncé things that don't involve people or performing or that kind of thing. And sometimes you have to be like, here's how I would act if I showed up to interviews full of confidence, knowing that I can do everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of the things I've also told people is when Donald Trump was elected president (and maybe you guys have to cut this out. I don't know.) I said to myself, you know if he gets to be president…because there are a lot of people where I was like, maybe they have something I don't have that makes them better at being president. And then when Donald Trump was president, I was like, I think I would still struggle, but I absolutely could be president and do that. And I was like, if he gets to be president of United States, at this point, all bets are off. I get to literally do anything I want to do. It might take me a while to figure it out. But why is everyone else getting to do things? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm realizing there's so much stuff out there where the people we think know so much more than us really don't, and it's really just us scamming ourselves into thinking that we don't know the things that we actually know. And then we see somebody else doing it, and we're like, wow, I really scammed myself out of that bag. And that's sad. That hurts. I'm like, don't scam yourself. Don't cheat yourself out of things. Make other people do the work of closing the door in your face. Stop closing doors in your own face because it's not endearing. It's not helping you. And you're like, oh, what if I embarrass myself? Everyone embarrasses themselves. Even Beyoncé has fallen on stage. She got her wig stuck in a wind machine, and we still love her. It's okay. If your wig gets stuck in a wind machine in your interview, stop, handle it, and then keep going. And so that's one of the mindset things where you really have to remind yourself you know things, and it's okay to not know the things. But you just need to sound really confident when you say, "You know, I don't know that, but I'm really interested in it." And that's the thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the other part is really no one can help you in your job search if they don't know you're looking. And people oftentimes feel shame. They're like, oh, I'm looking for a job. I've been looking for so long. I promise you, a lot of people are not even thinking about. Oh, why does that person not have a job yet? So, number one, you need to tell people even if you're like, I have a job right now, and it's just miserable. In private, the people you trust, email those people. It doesn't have to be people in your workplace if you don't trust those people. People you know in the industry that kind of thing or in some of these private groups we just talked about message them saying, "Hey, here's my situation, dah, dah, dah. I'm looking for…" and be specific as possible about what you're looking for, the type of role, the level you're at, those kinds of things. If there's a specific geographical area, say, "This is what I'm looking for." People cannot help you look… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then also, even if you're like, oh my gosh, but how do I use &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; to leverage that? I can't go through all the things you need to do with your &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; in just this one podcast. But one thing I will tell you is the more visible you are on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;; the more likely recruiters will reach out to you. So if you're in a position where you can't say, "Hey, I'm looking for a job on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;," write about something completely different and be like, "Hey, I took a course four months ago in Python, dah, dah, dah. And it was really great. And I did this project from Kaggle." If that's it, write that and get in the regular habit of you don't have to write something really corny on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. You can just write like, oh, I'm going to sign up for this course. Or oh, I read this blog post. I thought it was really interesting and posting that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the more you are active on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; actually increases your ranking in their algorithm, which means that when somebody searches for your role, geographic area, on whatever specialty it is, it means you're going to be ranked higher when the recruiters come looking for you. And I do know this not just because the eBay person, but I have a very good friend who's in recruitment at a company here in New York City, and they literally text me once a quarter. They're like, "You have no idea how many times you came up in my searches this quarter." So my thing is be visible. Even if you can't say, "Hey, I'm looking for a job," talk about something else because it doesn't matter. We don't need the recruiters to necessarily see, like, hey, Aaron is looking for a job. They just need to see, oh, the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; algorithm says that they're very relevant for that role, and relevance is actually related to your activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So also another thing I'm going to tell you is always reply to your &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; DMs. Even if that recruiter is wildly off about what they're looking for, just reply and say, "Hey, not looking for this, but if you know about…" the type of role you're looking for, insert that name there, "let me know." And if you're usually getting a lot of messages for roles that have nothing to do with what you're doing, then I would just update your keywords on your &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; because that's usually the culprit. So those are the two things where...I know there's a lot, but the two main categories of things people can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Awesome. Thank you so much. It's a very freeing thought that if my wig gets stuck in a wind machine, I can pause, untangle, and move on with my life. But I want to come back to something that you said about essentially let's not talk ourselves out of the bag. This is something that I talk about a lot when it comes to speaking. Somebody thinks to themselves, oh, I don't have anything interesting to say. I don't have anything that's worthy of XYZ conference. I don't have the presence to be up there with these famous speakers. And I'm like, hold up, that's not your job. It's not your job to decide who gets to be on stage. That is the job of the selection committee. It is your job to present your thoughts and ideas in the best way that you can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah, it's really like I'm in a shoot your shot world when it comes to career opportunities, whether it's speaking opportunities anything like that. I used to think the same thing where I'm like, oh, I'm not like this person. I'm not like that person. I spent so much time comparing myself to other people that I thought, oh my God, well, that person is so amazing, and I don't think that way. I don't talk that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I realized that was my superpower was that I don't think like those people, and those people could be at the same conference as me. And like, that's why they would have you alongside with those other people because you don't think that way, and they want to have people that are different. They don't want 50 of the same person. And it's not your job to filter yourself out for them. That's why they have a committee. You are not getting compensated for filtering yourself out of the process. There is no benefit for you. And like I said, we're in a post-shoot your shot world. I get to be anything. I started just saying like, when opportunities came by, I would just be like, I'm just going to put my name in the hat and see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked at this blockchain startup that was part of &lt;a href="https://consensys.net/"&gt;ConsenSys&lt;/a&gt; for a bit. &lt;a href="https://consensys.net/"&gt;ConsenSys&lt;/a&gt;, for those who aren't aware, they're like an incubator accelerator for blockchain, specifically Ethereum-based startups. And &lt;a href="https://consensys.net/"&gt;ConsenSys&lt;/a&gt; sent out this email to everybody like, "Hey, who's interested in doing blockchain talks at &lt;a href="https://www.morgan.edu/"&gt;Morgan State&lt;/a&gt; as like a guest lecture? And I was like, oh my God, that sounds terrifying. And I don't think any university would ever let me speak to their undergrads because I'm not a professor. I didn't go to grad school. I have no idea what I would talk about. And I was like, but maybe they'll have an idea, and it'll be an idea I can bounce off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was like, I'm going to reply and say, "Hey. I'm interested in this," and so I did. And they were like, "Great, here are the different topics. What do you want to talk about?" And I was like, "Okay, let's talk about Initial Coin Offering scams," because scams are kind of fun to talk about, and so that was my talk. And they were like, "Cool, let's do it." Actually, this was pre-pandemic. I went to &lt;a href="https://www.morgan.edu/"&gt;Morgan State&lt;/a&gt;, did this guest lecture, and everything. And I'm like, holy shit, I just guest lectured at a university. But my first reaction was the university is not going to be like, okay, cool. You go talk to the students about the blockchain things. And also, I had been in the blockchain world for less than a year at that point. And I was ready to filter myself out. And like you said, until someone starts paying me a lot of money, and we're talking about enough money to like I can retire now, I'm not going to filter myself out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: There you go. It's exactly the same for salary positions. I came across a job at &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.gatsbyjs.com/"&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;, and I was like, wow, this job description. It's exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to do. This is the work that I'm doing on the side right now. And the only thing was like, oh, but it's a Staff Software Engineer position. And I'm like, ooh, I'm not a Staff Software Engineer. And lo and behold, I go for it anyway. I'm like, what do I have to lose? I go for it. I get the job. And here I am doing Staff Software Engineer work eventually as a staff software engineer at &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.gatsbyjs.com/"&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;. And I'm like, huh, imagine if I had just decided for them that I wasn't capable of this, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah. That's the thing. It's like, you could have decided for them. But then it's like, what would that serve you? At the end of the day, what does shrinking ourselves do for us? How does getting paid less for performing...It's like having the ability to perform at a higher level but being in a lower title. How is that serving us or anything that we want? And the answer is it doesn't. And it makes our anxiety, I guess, feel good. But then, at the end of the day, it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy where it feeds the anxiety and makes you the next time be like, well, I was right for not applying to that thing or maybe not even right. There's no proof that you were right because you didn't shoot your shot. But you're like, well, we chose not to apply for that one. So we're not going to apply for this one either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Absolutely. And it just keeps going like that. What you said about making ourselves small that actually reminds me a lot of something that a career coach said to me once. She was basically like, "Well, it seems like in this one aspect of your life you're doing all these things, and you're leading communities, and you're teaching and speaking and whatnot. But in this other part of your career, you are making yourself small, and it's really hurting you." And in that scenario, I was not being recognized for the work that I was doing. And I was playing the work I was doing down to myself and not promoting what I was doing, and it made it so much more difficult for me to move forward in that space. And so, I think that really trying not to stifle your own shine in that way is huge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: And it's hard but identifying why you're trying to talk yourself out of that because that's the bigger thing. It's like, why do we feel like we have to shrink ourselves? And it's usually tied to some sort of past trauma where somebody said something about us in a previous job, or we got one bad review. And we let that one thing define us moving forward. There was, I remember, and this is not to put them against each other, an article once where somebody said, "Well, Beyoncé is no Ashanti." And granted, they are two very different musicians. But it's also like, had Beyoncé been like, "I'm never going to achieve Ashanti's level of presence, and fame, and success," that doesn't make any sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, it's doing other people's whatever, like terrible stuff they're going to do or whatever they're going to say or filtering they're going to do for you. It's like we're preemptively doing it because we're scared of getting hurt for whatever the reason is that we're scared of getting hurt by hearing no. And it's kind of like training ourselves to be able to say yes to us and let other people be the ones responsible for saying no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Absolutely. Rolling it back a little bit, I want to talk about some of the pieces that you have cultivated over the years. You do a workshop called &lt;a href="https://www.annetgriffin.com/workshop"&gt;Human First, Product Second&lt;/a&gt;. And I'd love to hear a little bit about how that came to be and what you offer in that workshop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah. So this workshop actually started out as a talk. And it was maybe one of my first five talks ever. And I pitched it for &lt;a href="https://www.writespeakcode.com/"&gt;Write/Speak/Code&lt;/a&gt;. You clearly know what it is, but for those of you listening, &lt;a href="https://www.writespeakcode.com/"&gt;Write/Speak/Code&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing organization for women and non-binaries who basically want to help them produce more thought leadership pieces. And it's; basically, they have workshops on writing the speaking part and also code things and then combining them all together for thought leadership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I put this together because I was like, as a product manager, and as someone who’s like an ethnically ambiguous black woman and this kind of thing, and being in America, and being in tech, but being in an industry where a lot of my ancestors weren't given the opportunities that would have even let them in, even if they weren't barred from being in this industry. And it really talks about how tech for so long excluded so many people, whether it's because of LGBTQ or ableism, or racism, all the isms and how oftentimes those are left out and how that's leading to biases that we see today. And focusing on our human sides first, which for me is partly identity but also identities of people that I don't represent, thinking about how is this serving humans, even humans who aren't our customers but it might impact them? How do we build products that aren't just we're going to ignore everything except for the North Star metric? And as long as it hits the North Star Metric, we don't care about the destruction it leaves in its path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so that was the talk I gave, and I decided to expand it into a workshop series, which I gave for the first time this spring with LACMA, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.lacma.org/"&gt;LA County Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; with one of their digital teams. And really, it just expands on those points and teaches people about both design thinking and design justice also tech ethics in general. Because some of these people know a little bit about this, but they need more of an intro into like how do I get into more resources? What are some of the deeper concepts in these things so that we can apply them in our workplace? And I was like, how do I make this into a thing that's not just like I go in and do a cute, little 40-minute talk but I help companies where they want a starting place for doing better with their products, and they want to make their products more human rather than just being we are robots, and we just follow the metrics without any consideration of how the metrics impact real humans? And that's really where that came from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Awesome. That's exciting. So between that work with &lt;a href="https://www.annetgriffin.com/workshop"&gt;your workshop&lt;/a&gt; and speaking and writing, how does all of that work fit into your career right now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: That's a great question. I'm going to be honest where I think my career really when I say, quote, unquote, "started" where it's like the part where I actually started having fun is when I decided both to stop counting myself out but also just doing the things that felt right. When I first started doing the writing and speaking, there was really no master plan. These were just things that I was like; I’m interested in it, and there's not a lot of people talking about this right now. We're talking about in the way I'm talking about it from my perspective as a product manager and as a black woman. And so that was where that started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where it fits in my career is that it's something where I learned that you could have a lot of fun in your day job, but there's no day job you're going to have that's going to let you do all the things that interest you from a professional standpoint. Because your day job pays you to do a certain realm of things, and you're not going to get to do all the things. But how do you get to develop your interest in AI or blockchain or talking about certain topics in those areas if that's not what your company does? And even if you go to that type of company, there's going to be other things that that company is not interested in doing or talking about and that kind of thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so for me, those things make my career feel complete because it's not just like, oh, this will help me get more product management jobs, but it's also like, yeah, showing them I can do this does help my career and getting another nine-to-five or whatever. But also, it really helps me feel complete because it's not like, oh, I wish I could learn that. But do I have to now become a data scientist full-time if I'm interested in AI? It helps me feel fulfilled in the areas I'm interested in without being like, I have to abandon my first love career, which is product management to do these things. And being like, I could be a product manager who does these things and cares about these things without necessarily always being like, I'm in an AI company, or I'm in a blockchain company, or I am a full-time tech ethicist or whatever. I can do those things, and all those things have a place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once you start doing the things that really interest you even outside of your nine-to-five, it really helps you better understand what you look for in your nine-to-five and what you're like; I would rather continue to do this separate. And then also, it gives you the outside experience that if you ever were like, actually, I'm really interested in doing this full-time now. You can at least say, well, I'm taking a data science class. I've written these articles here, and here they are. I'm interested in going much more deep in the data science world as a PM. You have a starting point instead of being like, well, I didn't know what to do. And I wasn't interested in being a data scientist, so I just did nothing. And so it makes me feel a lot more complete because it's harder for people to put me in a box because no matter what people let me do at work or don't let me do, I have all these other things that go on regardless of what happens in my day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: I love that. Thank you. So as we wrap up here, I just want to say thank you one more time because this has been a really, really wonderful conversation, and I just really appreciate your time. What's the best way for folks to find you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne: Yeah, you can find me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annetgriffin"&gt;@annetgriffin&lt;/a&gt;. So that’s A-N-N-E-T-G-R-I-F-F-I-N. Or you can go to &lt;a href="https://www.annetgriffin.com/"&gt;annetgriffin.com&lt;/a&gt;. So again, that's  A-N-N-E-T-G-R-I-F-F-I-N .com. Those are the two best ways to find me. It's the same also for &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annetgriffin/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, the Anne T. Griffin thing. If you &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annetgriffin/"&gt;add me on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, leave a message saying you listened to this podcast. Also, that's really good LinkedIn etiquette, pro tip. So I'd love to talk to you, and I just wish all the best for everyone listening to this podcast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aisha: Fabulous. And thank you so much for listening. Be sure to check out our other podcasts, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyglotShow"&gt;Polyglot Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ObservyMcObserv"&gt;Observy McObservface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of the rest of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;therelicans.com&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, most anything The Relicans get up to online will be on that site. We'll see you next week. Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🔐 Creating a Crypto Token Gated Express application</title>
      <author>Julien Genestoux</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:34:48 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/julien51/creating-a-crypto-token-gated-express-application-1i62</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web3 encompasses a plethora of elements that empower us to build a more accessible web for everyone -- including Non-Fungible-Tokens, Token Gating, and decentralization. One perk from the emergence of web3 is moving away from the monetization of our personal data to sell ads. Win-win for us all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm here to show you how simple the process is for token gating content in an Express.js application using the &lt;a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/"&gt;Ʉnlock Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. Ʉnlock is a protocol for memberships that allows anyone to deploy a "lock" (a membership smart contract). The contract specifies the &lt;em&gt;terms&lt;/em&gt; of the membership: including price, duration, number of members, and many more parameters necessary to run a thriving membership subscription. When a supporter wants to join your membership, they simply pay the specified amount to the contract and will receive an NFT that represents the purchased membership.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/premium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;membersOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... unchanged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: that's all you need to monetize your application!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://locked-time.herokuapp.com/"&gt;Try it&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://github.com/julien51/locked-time"&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚀 Let's get started!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requirements&lt;/em&gt;: you need to use an ethereum/web3 wallet such as &lt;a href="https://metamask.io/"&gt;MetaMask&lt;/a&gt;. We will be using a the Rinkeby test network for this tutorial (no need to spend &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; money, get some fake Ether &lt;a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/"&gt;on this faucet&lt;/a&gt;), and when you decide to ship, you can use Ethereum's mainnet, or the &lt;a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/xdai"&gt;xDAI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/blog/unlock-on-polygon"&gt;Polygon&lt;/a&gt; networks if you want to skip the high gas fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NdcozxPU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/blob/master/design/brand/PNG/Unlock-LogoMark-Circle.png%3Fraw%3Dtrue" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NdcozxPU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/blob/master/design/brand/PNG/Unlock-LogoMark-Circle.png%3Fraw%3Dtrue" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-a-lock"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying a lock 🔒
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first step. Unlock Inc provides a front-end for this to be a bit easier, but know that you could also do it directly from the smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.unlock-protocol.com/dashboard"&gt;Go to the Unlock Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. Connect your wallet and then click on the "Create Lock" button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then complete the form to specify the name of your membership contract, the duration (in days) of each membership, the amount of members, as well as the price for each membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zRNZb3aH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8awt3uzh2vnpdkwflcr5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zRNZb3aH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8awt3uzh2vnpdkwflcr5.png" alt="Dashboard Example" width="880" height="144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on "Submit" will prompt you to submit a transaction that will deploy your lock! It usually does not take much more than a few seconds but you will be able to see the address of your lock right away. This is the address of the smart contract you just deployed! It is yours, and only yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one I deployed is called "Another Lock", and its memberships are valid for 1 day, and they cost 0.001 Ether. It is at the address &lt;code&gt;0x32BeC8e1Fc72509fFa115bd6a0f064Ec77319E4A&lt;/code&gt; and we can &lt;a href="https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x32BeC8e1Fc72509fFa115bd6a0f064Ec77319E4A"&gt;inspect it on Etherscan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KLxxXrGh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/liqijhj24miky8dpz7vk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KLxxXrGh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/liqijhj24miky8dpz7vk.png" alt="Deployed Lock" width="880" height="98"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side bar shows lets you enable credit cards 💳 (for users who do not have a crypto wallet, withdraw its funds, and more... feel free to tinker with it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#express-application-for-date-and-times"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Express application for date and times
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you're familiar with Express, you won't learn much so skip to next section!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this demo, I created a dummy &lt;a href="https://expressjs.com/"&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt; application that gives the time ⏰ in all timezones. The "free" version just includes 4 cities around the world, but the premium version offers a list of 457 cities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how the code looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieParser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cookie-parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;zones&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./zones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookieParser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Helper function that returns date as a string in a city&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateInZone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;timeZone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;zone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Main root of the application that only shows 4 cities&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;World Clocks&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is now: &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateInZone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Asia/Tokyo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateInZone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Asia/Kolkata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Premium version: &amp;lt;a href="/premium"&amp;gt;select any time zone&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  ... (check github for code that renders all zones!)

&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Example app listening at http://localhost:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see it is a pretty standard Express application. The list of zones is stored in &lt;code&gt;zones.js&lt;/code&gt; file that you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/julien51/locked-time/blob/master/zones.js"&gt;find on the repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-the-lock"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding the lock
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to &lt;a href="https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/developers/unlock-platform"&gt;integrate Ʉnlock in application&lt;/a&gt;, from the lowest levels by hooking into smart contracts directly, all the way to the front-end where some JavaScript can be used to hide/show content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we will use the &lt;code&gt;@unlock-protocol/unlock-express&lt;/code&gt; npm module. This module provides a middleware that can be added to any Express route in order to ensure that members only can indeed access the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the plugin through &lt;code&gt;yarn add @unlock-protocol/unlock-express&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;npm i --save @unlock-protocol/unlock-express&lt;/code&gt;, and then let's include it in our application:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;configUnlock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@unlock-protocol/unlock-express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After this, it's just a matter of configuring the express and using the middleware. The configuration has 3 important elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;yieldPaywallConfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;getUserEthereumAddress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;updateUserEthereumAddress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-yieldpaywallconfig-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;yieldPaywallConfig&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is used by the plugin to ask the application what configuration it should use. The main aspect of this is of course to list what "locks" should be used specifically. You can find more details &lt;a href="https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/developers/paywall/configuring-checkout#the-paywallconfig-object"&gt;in the Unlock docs&lt;/a&gt;, but here is what we'll use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yieldPaywallConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;locks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0x32BeC8e1Fc72509fFa115bd6a0f064Ec77319E4A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, we say that we only have a single lock that we accept memberships from and it is on the network &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; (the Rinkeby test network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-getuserethereumaddress-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;getUserEthereumAddress&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a way for the middleware to ask the application for the user's Ethereum address, if it knows about it. Here for example, the application could look up its user database and just yield the address of the user... etc. However, in this example, we do not have a user database/table, so we will only use a cookie. So here is what that looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUserEthereumAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userAddress&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-updateuserethereumaddress-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;updateUserEthereumAddress&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the middleware has a way to inform the application of the user's wallet address, so that the application can store it. There again, the application could decide to store that information in a database or, like we do it here, just store the address in a cookie.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateUserEthereumAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;userAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it, here is how the full configuration looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;membersOnly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;configureUnlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;yieldPaywallConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;locks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0xafa8fE6D93174D17D98E7A539A90a2EFBC0c0Fc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;getUserEthereumAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userAddress&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;updateUserEthereumAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;userAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;💡 Please note that the configuration block yields the &lt;code&gt;membersOnly&lt;/code&gt; middleware that we'll use in the last step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-the-middleware-to-our-premium-route"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding the middleware to our premium route
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the middleware exists, we can very easily plug it into our premium route and here is how it looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/premium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;membersOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... unchanged&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;✅ As you can see, it's quite trivial! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-touches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final touches
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice addition is to let the user "log out" by just deleting the cookie. For this, we're adding a route:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/logout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearCookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;userAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;🧪 Want to try it out? We deployed the application &lt;a href="http://locked-time.herokuapp.com/"&gt;on Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
🧐 Want to look at the code? It is all on &lt;a href="https://github.com/julien51/locked-time"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note on security&lt;/em&gt;: one could note that the cookie itself could be spoofed. This is true, but also easily fixable using multiple approaches. One of them is to change how &lt;code&gt;updateUserEthereumAddress&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by using the 4th and 5th arguments passed to this function that include a signature and the message signed by the user. By recovering the signature, the application can get the &lt;em&gt;certainty&lt;/em&gt; that the user's address actually matches the visitor (especially if the message signed includes a timestamp or some kind of unique nonce, configurable in the paywall config).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👋 Closing thoughts!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unlock-protocol/unlock-express"&gt;express plugin&lt;/a&gt; means that a developer can start monetizing their application from anywhere in the world, in a matter of minutes. There is no need to agree to terms of service, apply for an API key and no approval or review of your application!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally you as a developer can decide of the benefits you want to offer to your members, whether its access to unique content, special features. One of my favorite feature is that the locks themselves are not even tied to a specific platform. For example, if you decide to do support over Discord, you could use a bot like &lt;a href="https://swordybot.com/"&gt;SwordyBot&lt;/a&gt; to easily identify paying members (or grant them access to a special channel!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vx10OhIM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1qjuxc3vwbcsowmxg8ex.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vx10OhIM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1qjuxc3vwbcsowmxg8ex.png" alt="Unlock Showcase" width="880" height="487"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I would also recommend that &lt;a href="https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/governance/grants-bounties-and-matchings"&gt;you apply for an Unlock grant&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a repost with little modifications of a post originally in my blog.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sentence “if the code works, don’t fix it” is sometimes taken as a rule by newbie developers. Though most of the times it works, i Personally think it is just an excuse from lazy developers.&lt;br&gt;
What is even a bigger problem are people who learn frameworks without learning the basic concepts which causes them to write spaghetti code, and when they see this "Rule" they think it's something everyone does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Read The Code Multiple Times Until You Understand It ( We All Know that our old code can only be understood by GOD but still give it a try )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate Logic From State / UI Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Design Pattern To Turn The Logic Into Small Testable and Extensible Pieces.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;Relicans&lt;/a&gt; host &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wyhaines"&gt;Kirk Haines&lt;/a&gt; talks to &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt;’s, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmar"&gt;Chris Mar&lt;/a&gt; about building an architecture practice, having a responsibility to give back to the engineers that are beginning in their careers and helping them grow in leadership roles, and why as a leader, it is imperative that you model positive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris and Kirk even dive into a little crypto chat, and discuss and break down things like the blockchain and NFTs in simpler terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan Scheffler: Hello and welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/polyglot"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt;, proudly brought to you by &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com"&gt;New Relic's&lt;/a&gt; developer relations team, &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;The Relicans&lt;/a&gt;. Polyglot is about software design. It's about looking beyond languages to the patterns and methods that we as developers use to do our best work. You can join us every week to hear from developers who have stories to share about what has worked for them and may have some opinions about how best to write quality software. We may not always agree, but we are certainly going to have fun, and we will always do our best to level up together. You can find the show notes for this episode and all of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="//developer.newrelic.com/podcasts"&gt;developer.newrelic.com/podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you so much for joining us. Enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk Haines: So welcome to Polyglot. My name is Kirk Haines. You can find me &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wyhaines&amp;amp;oq=wyhaines&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46i199i433i465i512j46i175i199i512j46i433i512j46i175i199i512j0i512j46i131i199i433i465i512j46i175i199i512j46i433i512j0i271.2364j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;@wyhaines&lt;/a&gt; pretty much anywhere on the internet, on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wyhaines"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and everywhere else. And today, I'd like to welcome my guest, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmar"&gt;Chris Mar&lt;/a&gt;. Chris, tell us a little bit about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Mar: Thanks, Kirk. Thanks for having me. So I'm Chris Mar. I work at &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt;, and I've been working at &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt; for the past eight years. I think my total software career is a little over 25 years at this point. Interestingly, I've had this unique experience where I've worked at small to very large companies. So I've had the opportunity to work at different-sized companies from two to three people up to 40,000-plus people because I had a stint at &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; for a while. I bring a lot of experiences that maybe I never once had the opportunity to, just as the software industry has changed. And I was looking forward to talking to you today about Polyglot, architecture, and NFTs. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Awesome. That sounds great. So, when did you work at &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;? I'm just curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: So I was actually in acquisition because I worked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;. So I worked at Sun Microsystems for many years. And we were doing Java there. I really enjoyed working at Sun. When I was growing up, Sun was one of the real big companies, so you always aspired to work for Sun. And some of the smartest engineers before all worked there. So I really looked forward to working there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I actually got into Sun through an acquisition. So I was at a startup, and we were doing monitoring and management of computer systems, and then we got acquired by Sun. And I had a long stint at Sun, then we got acquired by &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, and I had a year at &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;. And then that just got to be a really large company. So I actually went from &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; at 40,000-plus down to a small startup of two people to three people. So it was a pretty big jump, but it was exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Yeah, early in my career, I did a lot of work actually on the system side. I was working for one of the Baby Bell companies. And all of the engineering staff, like 5,000 engineers, all had SPARC 5s or SPARC 10s as their workstations. And I was responsible for maintenance on all of those at the operating system level as well as larger systems all running on various Sun Microsystems workstations operating software. And so yeah, Solaris Sun Microsystems hardware formed the foundation of a lot of the early parts of my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Sure. And the advertising used to be "We put the. in .com." So every startup during that .com era and the turn of the century, you immediately bought stacks and stacks of Sun hardware to build your .com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Yeah, that was all everybody ran on for a while because it was a high-risk proposition to run on Linux. That's kind of cool. So you went from &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; to tiny, little companies. And then, at some point in time, you transitioned from Java to other languages and found yourself in the Ruby world. Do I have that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yeah, that's exactly right. So I was working at Sun at the time. I remember the &lt;a href="https://www.jruby.org/"&gt;JRuby&lt;/a&gt; guys. I saw them speak at one of the Java conferences, and they came to work for Sun. Just listening to them talk about &lt;a href="https://www.jruby.org/"&gt;JRuby&lt;/a&gt;...and then a lot of it was obviously about Ruby on Rails at the time. And I was like, wow, this was just mind-blowing the way they talked about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I remember it was in San Francisco, the conference center there. They were talking about this. And I went right out, and I remember I walked right over. And &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Tate"&gt;Bruce Tate&lt;/a&gt; had written a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Running-Bruce-Tate/dp/B003D3OGCY"&gt;book about getting started with Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;. I went and bought that book immediately. And at the hotel, I was reading that book. And all along the flight home, I just read that book. And I was just amazed considering the way we were writing the J2EE applications for the web and all what we were doing, the deploying the JARs and just the complexity that we had just to make webpages, and the beautiful story of Ruby on Rails. I remember buying that book and reading it. I got home, watched that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY"&gt;DHH video on how quickly he started a blog with the generators and things&lt;/a&gt;. I was hooked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so then I just spent the next few years still doing my day job, but Ruby and Rails just learning, building side projects, and connecting with the community. And that was one of the things that really attracted me. It was just this open community of people building cool things and sharing versus kind of like...I guess at that time; it felt like Java was really corporate and maybe not even sharing that much with each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, when the opportunity came, and I found a job that I could transition to, there was sort of a startup in my local area, &lt;a href="https://spreecommerce.org/"&gt;Spree Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. So if you know the Ruby on Rails e-commerce project, they were starting a company using that on top of that project, so I went to work there. And it was a really big jump into the Ruby and Rails world and the open-source community. It was a huge transition. And most people I remember at the time were like, "Why are you going from this big company enterprise software job to a start-up with an open-source community where they're giving away the software for free?" But I felt like I had to do it. And it's been great ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: So what timeframe was that? Because I remember I think it was 2008 &lt;a href="https://rubyconf.org/"&gt;RubyConf&lt;/a&gt; was in San Francisco. And then there was &lt;a href="https://www.jrubyconf.com/"&gt;JRubyConf&lt;/a&gt; right at the end of RubyConf. Was it then or was it somewhere --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: It was a little bit past there. It was in Baltimore. There was &lt;a href="https://railsconf.org/"&gt;RailsConf&lt;/a&gt; in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay. Oh, it was the Baltimore RailsConf. Okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: And that's where I was like, I'm going to see if I can network because I lived in Washington, D.C., near Washington, D.C. So I was just like, I'm going to see if I can network, and I was able to find the guys from Rails Org and Spree at the time. And I connected with them, and then I was able to make the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay, that's really cool. That kind of sets the connections in my head. I was at that Baltimore RailsConf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yeah, that was a really good one. And I remember everybody came to Baltimore, and most people at the conference what they knew about Baltimore was from &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-wire"&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;. [laughter] So they expected...many people I met there were like, "This is not like The Wire. It's really nice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Yeah, that was my experience, not so much expecting The Wire, but just that it was a nice venue. It was a nice place. The weather was great. It was really a lot of fun being there. So that covers your history and how you got into Ruby and how you got into Rails. And in that time, you've moved through quite a few different roles; it sounds like. So what are you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: I'm building an architecture practice, or I lead an architecture practice at &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt;. I went to that startup, and it was all Ruby and Rails. But after a couple of years, I thought it was time to transition. And &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt; is a local company. And I got to know...again, with the Ruby on Rails community, I got to know a lot of engineers at &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt; just because there were so many great meetups. It was like a really small community of people who just really loved and were passionate about Ruby on Rails. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, when I made the transition, I went over to &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt;. And I worked there for a few years as a senior software engineer. As we started to really grow fast and expand the size of the teams, we really needed to build an architecture practice. I was asked to help do that. So I've been doing that for the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Cool. And you mentioned to me when we were talking before we started recording that you've really been focusing on topics related to growing a new generation of programmers and developers and leadership topics around that. And I was wondering if there were things you wanted to talk about with regard to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Sure. I think as you grow in your role and experience (It's a long time I've been programming.), you start to realize I got to give back is one thing that's top of mind for me. Like, there have been a lot of great mentors over the years who have helped me grow in my career. And as being in a leadership role, so architecture is obviously a leadership role at the company. But I also have a responsibility to give back to the engineers that are growing in their careers and so paying it forward or paying it back. I have a debt, and a Lannister always pays his debts. I always think about this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: I got to help that next generation. And it's a challenge. We've been around a long time, and the experiences that we grew into our careers are different than the challenges that engineers meet now. But I do think it's important to give back and help the next generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you're in an architect role, one of your responsibilities is to drive a vision and challenge the team to go in new technical directions or solve big business problems. And the engineers need to be able to take those challenges and carry them forward. And if your engineers are not helping lead the way, it puts too much responsibility on you to try to just move the challenges. I can ask, but if I can't have more people taking up, working with me, getting inspired by the same vision, and helping lead that change, it makes it a much more difficult job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I realized one of the ways you can give back is just to help engineers grow in their leadership. This is something I started about...I actually just took a whole group of my cohort of engineers through a leadership program. And one of the things I realized when starting this was that I would maybe talk to engineers, and they're like, "Well, we can't do that," or "We don't have authority to do that." They just don't have the skills to lead in place or even have exposure to this is how you lead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And leadership, I don't think it's a natural ability. Some people may have a natural ability. But if you think about the great leaders you have at your company or the great leaders you admire, they’ve all learned some of these leadership tools. And they just get a lot of reps at practicing that, and that's how they become great leaders. But for technical engineers, you've always been like the smartest person in the room. You always solve problems by engineering. You can solve problems with code. You think critically, and you can solve problems. But leadership is not that. You can't necessarily just code people to do what you want. You can't influence somebody like --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's different. It's just another challenge. And when I started, I told the engineers this is just another language. These are skills you can learn, and you can apply just as if you were learning another framework that you want to use. It's just another set of tools that you can have to help you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so when you think about important things in leadership like change management, influencing people, having critical conversations, there are good techniques that you can learn that you can apply. And as with the reps, you can build it up to where you are very comfortable leading in place and even leading your team where you don't necessarily have authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior engineer might not have authority over the mids and juniors on his team or her team, but they need to influence them. They need to help them grow. They need to inspire them to take action where they need them to take. And so those are the kinds of skills that I've really been focused on teaching our teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: And so how do you teach it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: That's a really good question. So at &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt;, we have a whole department that teaches leadership skills. And traditionally, they teach it to new managers, new directors, vice presidents. They learn these leadership skills. They have all-day programs where you get the firehose of all these, whatever the management techniques of the day are. But you see that your engineers like we talked about, need to have some leadership skills if you expect them to take on these huge challenges and move your engineering and your technical practice forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went to them, and they said, "These are the programs that we use." And so I accepted those programs, for example, change management's a huge one. If you're in your group and if you see something that needs to change, you can't just tell people, "This is wrong. Everyone start doing it this other way." [laughs] That doesn't work. Most of the time, it doesn't work. And then you just get frustrated, like, it's obvious that this way is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with some change management techniques, we learn that it's important to communicate and have an understanding of other people's views and understand maybe why they don't necessarily...and communicate and then to bring them along so that they feel like they have ownership in that change, too, and they're not just listening to your change. Those techniques you can learn. So then, I was able to take the materials they would use, maybe for a traditional manager role, and apply them to teaching engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: So, do you run actual classes for the engineers, or is it brown bag sessions? Or how do you structure that so that you reach the engineers who need it and so that it's a productive use of time? I'm curious about the logistics of how you do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: So the way I did it was I broke it up into different modules. So like, these next two weeks, we're going to talk about change management. And there were some class materials. Some of it is just like a LinkedIn learning video you would watch and maybe a reflection sheet with a couple of questions to think about how you might apply some of those to your job. And all I asked engineers was, like, let me have an hour a week, so about two hours over a two-week period. And then we would meet and have a...we called them a reflection session. So we would just get together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I thought it was important that the cohort, the group that we would meet, was all the same. So we had all senior engineers. So they are all dealing with the same situations, the same issues, feeling the same pressures from the company. They can share. They can be vulnerable and just share and say, "I have trouble with this. How do you get your team to change? How do you do these things?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will admit that I think a lot of engineers were cynical at first, which as a technical person, you're always solving with code and technical just saying, "Hey, these skills will help you..." But over time, I felt like the entire group felt like they were learning, and they started to understand after a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then we went through months of it. And we ended up just having a little graduation ceremony, like, hey, we went through this whole program, all these different lessons. And we built a cohort, and it was like a team-building session. So all of our seniors and juniors had this team-building session, and now they can rely on each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, within our organization, we have a tier of senior leaders that, as architecture, I can come to them and say, "Here are some of the big challenges we have to face. Here's what we have to do." And then they can take that back to the teams, and they can lead in place and lead their teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay, that's really cool. Yeah, that's really cool. I like that structure. So do you teach it to the seniors and then rely on them to trickle that down? Or do you bring the juniors in and work with them as a separate group? How do you structure that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: That's something that I've thought about a lot. Right now, what I'm doing is I'm challenging the seniors that yes, you are now a senior. You have to give back. So you need to mentor the next generation. And it's a great opportunity for them to have leadership because, in a mentor role, you're leading and helping somebody. And you start to actually feel the pain, and like, when you were a mid-person, you knew everything. [laughs] And you're helping them, so they get that perspective of helping the next generation and helping the mids and the juniors. And then I think that helps bring that next level up so that they can then level up to become a senior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the way I see it is as you're progressing in your career, the different roles, like as a junior and then as a mid, you're really good at...you're on keys, you're on screen, you're writing beautiful code, and you're solving the problems. But when you're asked to be a senior, you have a little bit...it's not just time in a role. I don't think it's you have three years here, so you're a senior now. I think it's you're starting to lead and starting to influence, so you're given the opportunity to become a senior engineer. But you're not just looking at the code. You look up, and now there's a whole team here, and I have to help that team be successful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you have to start looking up above your team and looking around the organization like, how does what we're doing, the changes we're doing, affect the rest of the organization? How does it fit in the bigger architecture, in the bigger vision of where the technology is going? And so they naturally get into more of a bigger role to start to lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: All right, that makes a lot of sense to me. Forward-thinking, looking down the road, I'm curious, do you see this as something that within &lt;a href="https://www.customink.com/"&gt;Custom Ink&lt;/a&gt;, it's sort of like you've built the structure, and this is what it is, and it'll just continue like this? Or are there other layers and other places that you want to grow this and take this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: It's still new to me. I was trying to solve a problem. I needed to challenge the teams to, hey, this is what we need. We need to be using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; more, so I need us to be thinking like, how do we move more to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;, for example? And when you have a lot of pressure on you, it's oh, I don't have time to do that. I don't have time to think about that. You have to ask the business if we can have time. You feel like all this pressure. We all feel this in our roles. But you can lead. And it's, how can I teach these techniques so then I can do bigger challenges? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was kind of I needed to solve this problem of being able to have bigger challenges and have the engineers lead to bigger efforts. And so then it was, can I teach them some leadership skills? Because I can kind of see it, but when you're in your role, and you feel stuck, no one's giving me time to do this. No one teaches. No one's telling me it's okay to learn this. And you can't see it, but you can learn it. And I think that was like the big aha moment for me, like, oh, if they can learn it, they can get inspired. They can start leading, and then we could all together tackle bigger challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. I like where you went with that because that's one of the things that for a lot of personalities, and the way that a lot of people come into this work, and the way that a lot of teams function, it can be a very difficult transition. You're focused on okay, here are my tasks and my sprint, and I've got to get these things done. And the larger perspective of how that interacts with your teammates and with the direction that the technology is going, you can lose sight of that or not even have sight of it, to begin with. Not even lose sight of it, but just never have the sight of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And learning that it's okay to explore and to take some ownership of okay, I am a knowledgeable person with opinions that I don't have to ask permission to express and to use to help steer things, that's a hard thing to learn. And so I think that's really cool that you've taken this structured approach to teaching some of that so that then that can trickle on down. And hopefully, then your juniors that are now in this environment won't have quite as much difficulty making that transition and moving into that mindset as they advance in experience. That's really neat. I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yeah, for sure. One of the asks of leaders is to model the behaviors. And so if you're a team leader and your seniors are cynical or just feel like they can't make change, then you're going to model that behavior, and we don't want that. We want them to feel like they can lead and make change. And we want the next generation thinking like, oh, I could start doing it. I could start modeling that behavior, and I'll become a leader. It kind of becomes a virtuous cycle when the next generation becomes leaders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think across the organization, especially as you start to scale up, there's this spirit of leadership that engineers have that it's beyond just the code, and the keyboards, and PRs. That's not their only job. They can drive big change. I tell the seniors, as senior engineers, they can effect the most change in the organization. If a senior says, "I want us all to start using some new library," they're the ones that can network with the other senior and say, "Hey, we're the ones making the decisions. We're the ones with hands on the keyboards. Let's start using that and prove that we can do it." And so, as a senior engineer, you really have a lot of power and a lot of authority to make change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Yeah, that's something that I think that there are a lot of organizations that lose sight of that. And when they lose sight of it, those engineers then feel disempowered. Then that's where you get into situations where you start having morale problems and things like that. And by empowering your developers and letting them make use of the responsibility and the power that they do have to make good decisions or to make bad decisions and learn from them, I think that that's how you build a strong engineering organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Sure, if you just have the smartest people...we all try to hire the smartest engineers in our hiring practice. So we have a room full of the smartest people. But if they're only going to just be coding, as an organization, you're not getting the best from everybody. If everyone feels agency, that they have ownership, and they know that they can be heard and that they can effect change, then they're going to take on the bigger challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Mm-hmm. So a tangential question just because I'm curious. So in your role, you're doing all of this architecture and leadership and things like that. Do you ever still have opportunities to actually write code and get down into the lower-level technical direction of anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Not as much as I would like. I think as you take on these bigger responsibilities, especially in architecture, you're not necessarily going to be hands on keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: And time is finite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yeah, time is finite. And I do force myself to get engaged with projects. I need to be able to boot up the apps. I'd be embarrassed if I couldn't at least boot up one of our apps and commit some code if I had to. But the way I look at it...because for years, I actually kind of thought this. The first 20 years of my career, I feel like I was a very successful software engineer. And I was like, I am never doing any kind of leadership. I'm just going to code all day. And I feel like I was pretty good at it. But I was challenged. The organization needed some architecture and needed someone to get into architecture, so I stepped into the role. And after time, just the responsibilities that came with that role, I just haven't been able to make the time to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something I wish I had told myself earlier (And this is for people who are thinking about coming into architecture.) is you're still solving problems. Like the fun stuff of a challenging problem and whiteboarding out the solutions, you're still doing that. You're just not necessarily coding it up. And it's the same considerations, boundaries, communication path, single-responsibility model, all the same stuff you apply to your code. You're just applying it on a more macro scale across the systems, across the teams, and communications. So you're still solving technical challenges. So I do feel a lot of reward from solving problems like that. But no, as my day job, I don't necessarily code it up as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Yeah, I was just kind of curious about that because that seems to be my experience is that even when people really want to keep their fingers in the pie, there's only so much time. And it can be hard for people to make that transition. But during your day job, do you have projects outside your day job that have your passion and have your focus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: I do. So I had mentioned one of the things I'm very interested in right now is blockchain. And it took me a while to understand just the momentum and what's actually changing. Everyone knows Bitcoin and crypto and people who are getting rich and buying Lamborghinis and stuff. But there's something else there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it took me a while to realize that &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; blockchain is built to have smart contracts put on top of it. And those smart contracts are code. So you're actually writing code that lives forever on the blockchain. And then, on top of that, then you can start to build applications. So all of a sudden, you're building these decentralized applications that just run. And they can run forever on this blockchain. And it's pretty amazing when you think about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, if I were to write a...and a lot of people write exchanges. You give me some crypto, and I'll give you a different one back. If you write that in a centralized fashion, we would spin up a Rails app, and we just would write that stuff to the database, and my balance would be in that database. But that is me owning that. So everybody in the world has to trust that I'm not getting into the database and changing things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I wrote that same app and deployed it to &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; in a decentralized fashion, now every transaction that makes a change of the data in my application is visible in the ledger. And anyone can go in and just see the transactions over time. And I don't have to maintain it. It's immutable code once you deploy it to the blockchain. So that was really interesting to me. And to see the world that was being built beyond the crypto thing, just the crypto Bitcoin stuff, but this worldwide computer of &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; and being able to deploy code to it and transact with it is really interesting to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I'm saying is that's kind of my hobby now. I find something interesting, and I just dig in and learn about the technology. Then obviously, that feeds back into my role of like, hey, I know about this emerging technology. And maybe or maybe not, it's useful at my company. That's where there's a lot of thought being put into, and maybe it's going to transition the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: So I'm going to step you back just a second because my hunch is that there are probably people listening to this right now who've heard the term blockchain. But a lot of what you said, they hear the words, and the words make sense. But the concept doesn't quite come together because that definition of what is a blockchain, I think, can be hard for people to easily grasp. And I was wondering if you could distill it down into a bite-sized piece, the TLDR of blockchain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Well, I'm definitely not the expert. And there are people that have a lot more experience that could explain it to you. But I could connect it to as a software engineer. I think that's where I can maybe connect that. So if you have a data store, this is a data store of, let's say, balances of an account or something. And to make a change to that data store, you have to do a transaction. And so today in the storage is $10. You make a transaction and subtract $1 from it. Tomorrow, you do a transaction to add $2 to it. Then all of a sudden, you have a history of all the changes that happened to that record in the data store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can think about it like now I have a record of how that value got there. That list of transactions that made the changes to it is public. It's a public ledger. And it was agreed upon by hundreds of people around the world running these...they call them miners, the nodes. So you say, "I'd like to make a transactional change to this field." Then hundreds of people agree that yes, we can make that change, and now it's all agreed upon. And so no one's going to change it, that's it. It's in the record forever. So if you start to think about it, it's really a big huge data store. On top of that, what if you can also write code and deploy it, and it can make those changes for you? Now you have applications running in this worldwide computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: So would it be fair to say that just as a concept, blockchain is essentially a public immutable database in the sense that once data goes in, you can change the data, but there is an immutable transaction log of every change, and it's all public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: That's exactly what it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay. See, I think that that's the part that is difficult for some people to grasp when they hear blockchain, and they hear blockchain being discussed. And there are various descriptions of running code and transactions and stuff like that. That very simple definition, I know, gets lost on a lot of people because there's so much vocabulary flying around that is hard to associate back to your everyday experience outside of that. It's a really interesting field. I think it has a lot of implications that we haven't even really figured out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: I agree. I think it's just emerging, like the possibilities. I had mentioned exchanges. You can define an organization that's an immutable code on the blockchain that just runs. You can do loans on the blockchain instead of having a bank. If you wanted to loan me money, you would deposit money in a bank, and that bank would loan me that money. I would pay them 5%. They would give you 2%, and that bank keeps 3%. And it is dependent on trusting that that bank is maintaining it, and they're just keeping values in some database they have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And imagine you could just remove the bank. The code is not hard. You deposit this money, it gives me that money. I owe back that money, and it pays you such and such amount of interest. You could code that up, and that could just run in a decentralized way. There's no one person or no one database that is maintaining that. And when I hear that, I get so excited just thinking about what's emerging, and what's growing, and what can happen. When people start to realize...they call it a smart chain, but it's really that you can write code and deploy it and have these applications that are running in a decentralized fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: And so then how does...and this gets into a topic area that I think there's also a lot of partial knowledge or lack of knowledge about and also maybe a lot of controversy about it. But how do NFTs layer on top of this? And are NFTs something that are just GIFs of cats or?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yes, yes, they are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I mentioned that you can deploy code that runs in the blockchain. Imagine you wrote a piece of code that was just an array of 10,000 pictures of cats, different pictures of cats. And that array just had an association to like, here's the address of who owns each one. Then you deploy that code up to &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;. And then you can ask that contract, assign cat number two to my address, and now I own it. Then when I make a deal, I sell that to you for $10,000, assign cat two to your address. But the beauty is that the decision-making and the assignment is all happening as a smart contract that's living in the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay. Yep. So that makes sense. So then what...and this is the part that I think if you just go hop on Twitter and you go find any thread talking about this, you'll see lots of opinions back and forth. But the gist of it is that, okay, so I buy that GIF of that cat. What does that really mean if somebody else can also just copy that image?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yes. Well, the example I always hear is that there's one Mona Lisa. And you can take a picture when you go visit The Louvre, but you don't own the Mona Lisa. But somebody does own the Mona Lisa. So there's a difference between you just having a copy of it and you owning it. But I think, realistically, if you've collected anything, if you've collected comics, or you've collected Star Wars statues (I have too many action figures downstairs) [laughs], they have a value. There's a small subset of those. And they become collectible because people want them. There's a demand for them, and only a handful of people can have them. So for you to get my Star Wars figure, I'm going to charge you money for it. So it has a perceived value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can look online on proxy figures or trading cards. And there are websites to tell you; here’s the current value for trading these things, and so we can trade them. So that's practically a currency. And so I think that's where NFT...instead of those, it's pictures of cats. But what's even better, if I have a basement full of action figures, now I have to maintain these things, dust them. And if I want to sell one, I had to sell it on eBay and pack it and ship it to you, whereas these pictures on the blockchain it's just a computer transaction. It's a transaction. So I can sell you the picture of that cat on my phone, basically. I don't need to pack and ship things. And then if you hold on to it and more people want the cats, you can sell it to somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Okay. All right, that makes sense. I think it's hard sometimes to find on the internet a nice, clear, concise description of these concepts. All you have to do is go look on Twitter. And while there are definitely very clear expressions of how it works, there are also a lot of confused expressions. And so, I appreciate that simple distillation of the concepts. That's really appreciated. And I think a lot of people will understand that. But is there anything else that you really would like to talk about or like to share with people? Anything that you're working on, anything that you want to communicate out, the floor is yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: It's a practice. As I've gotten better in this architecture role, one of the clear attributes you have to have or clear traits you have to have is trust. And I think this is something that people have a hard time transitioning. Engineers have their code. Any change you want to make to it, I'm going to PR that code. And it's got to be exactly indented the way I like it. [laughs] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you're going to tackle bigger problems, you have to step away and say, "I trust that the next person is going to do a good job with that code." And I can't spend my days watching your semicolon usage. I have to just trust you're going to make the best decision. And as you move up, you have to be able to trust people on it and even more and more trust. And then I think a lot of people fall into the trap of like, I'll trust them, but I'm going to review it. I'll trust but verify. And that's not going to work. I don't think that works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is you hire the best people. And you ask them to do the job, and they're smart, and they're going to do a good job. And you trust that they're going to do a good job. And then that really frees you up to focus on other problems. And as you start to trust more and more people, it just really helps free you up to solve these bigger problems. Because if I'm solving a problem moving 100 systems around, I can't be concerned about are they going to make the right decisions on every little thing? I have to just trust that they're going to make the best decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, to anybody who's thinking about an architecture role, that's something you have to start early in your career because engineers don't necessarily trust. We write lots of tools [chuckles] to do things because we don't trust the next person. But you have to start. And I think that's a really important trait. You have to start practicing in order to grow and to be able to take on bigger challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: That's really fantastic feedback because it is absolutely true. Every engineer has usually pretty strongly held opinions on it should be done this way. It should be done that way. Do we use tabs? Do we use spaces? At some point, those sorts of things, just like you say, become less important to what you need to do. Because it doesn't matter at the end of the day whether the next person down makes the same low-level decisions that you did. They're going to make decisions that work, and that frees you up to do the other things that you need to do to empower them to continue to make those decisions that work. Yeah, that's great advice. I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Yeah. So trust first and just trust in your practice that you're hiring the best people, and they're smart, and they're going to do a good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: Yep. Well, I think that that's a great place to wrap this up and end this. Do you want to let everybody know where they can find you online? Or if they want to reach out, or if they want to learn more about you, where they can look, where they can find you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris: Sure. I mostly interact with Twitter. So it's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmar"&gt;@cmar on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. And please DM me or tweet at me. And if you want to talk crypto, that's my current outside work hobby. I'd love to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirk: All right. Fantastic. Well, thanks again for joining me on here. And for everybody that's listening, thanks for joining us on Polyglot.

&lt;p&gt;Jonan Scheffler: Hello and welcome back to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/observymcobserv"&gt;Observy McObservface&lt;/a&gt;, proudly brought to you by &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com"&gt;New Relic's&lt;/a&gt; Developer Relations team, &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;The Relicans&lt;/a&gt;. Observy is about observability in something a bit more than the traditional sense. It's often about technology and tools that we use to gain visibility into our systems. But it is also about people because, fundamentally, software is about people. You can think of Observy as something of an observability variety show where we will apply systems thinking and think critically about challenges across our entire industry, and we very much look forward to having you join us. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="//developer.newrelic.com/podcasts"&gt;developer.newrelic.com/podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. We're so pleased to have you here this week. Enjoy the show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome back to Observy McObservface. I'm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thejonanshow"&gt;Jonan&lt;/a&gt;. And I'm joined today by my friend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ymotongpoo"&gt;Yoshi&lt;/a&gt;. How are you, Yoshi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi Yamaguci: Hi, how are you, Jonan? I'm pretty much excited to talk about observability stuff with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: I'm pretty excited to hear about observability stuff. You have a lot to say about this given your role. Well, speaking of, what is it that you do, Yoshi?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: I'm a Developer Advocate for &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, especially focusing on observability and SRE practices in the developer relation team there. I think that's the reason why I was invited to your show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: I think so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Maybe otherwise because I'm a Japanese developer, so [laughs] you'd like to talk about some Japanese stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: [laughs] I like to talk to Japanese developers very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: I am excited about all of those things. I've heard of Google. They're quite large. And I've been playing with &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. I got into using &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; stuff because I was playing with a device, the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_nest_speakers_displays"&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; device. I was trying to put together Google action to touch things up. I had one that would tell me at any moment how popular cats were on the internet by checking Twitter. I could ask it for the cat popularity score, and it would tell me back out of the last 10,000 tweets how many times people talked about cats. It was pretty important software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: [laughs] Interesting. I was in the Google Assistant Developer Relation team before joining the Google Cloud Developer Relation team. So I'm glad that you enjoyed &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Oh, cool. So you worked on &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; for how long? How long have you been at Google?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So I've been in Google for ten years plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So this year is the eleventh year. So I've been in the Google Cloud Developer Relation team for almost three years. And before that, I was in the Partner Developer Relations team, which is kind of difficult to explain. So that handles all the client-side technologies such as Android, Chrome, Chromecast, and &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt;, and blah, blah, blah. And then, we were focusing on creating the new use cases of using the latest technologies or latest features released by Google. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before the public release, we worked closely with the big companies or startups that are willing to use the EAP technology, Early Access Program technologies before the public release. And then we launch that feature or that technology in public. Then we showcase those big integrations with those companies. And then we worked on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: So you would work with...like, if you were working on &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; there, then you would work with Jonan's Cat Company, Jonan Cat Corporate to build this important integration, and then we would launch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: I see. Okay. So in that sense, Partner Developer Relations is the name of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Okay. And now you're not doing so much work with Partners like the Early Access Program stuff. What sort of stuff do you do now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: For example, I give a talk about our technologies or latest technologies heavily relevant to Google or cloud in general at developers’ conference. Or I give a talk about specific technologies relevant to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; to our customers in private sessions. And also, we do workshops as well as talks. And internally, we try out the new features or new products before the release and then give the friction log to the product team. And then also, I collect the feedback from the customers who use the EAP program, and I aggregate all of them and then share the feedback on improvement points to the product team. And also, I give comments to the design documentation before the actual implementation of the specific features or product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So we behave like the DevRel's user of the specific product, and then to make the developers' experience with that product better. So that's my day-to-day work. And also, I oftentimes work closely with the open-source people, for example, &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; or other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Let's talk about that. So you've been working with &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; for a while...well since &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; existed. Because before that, you were working with &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt;, the Google half that became...so it was &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; and Open…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: &lt;a href="https://opentracing.io/"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: &lt;a href="https://opentracing.io/"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt;. The two projects combined to become &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;, and that was about what, two years ago, three years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Two years ago, okay. And so what sort of stuff have you been talking about with &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So actually, I was not the core member of &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. But as a DevRel, I introduced &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; for external developers because it reduces the effort to instrument the application, and also, it gives wider options for the purpose which backends to use. So I did a lot of talks externally. And then for that, I had to communicate with the internal &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; team, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/belazzyyy"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;, who is now in the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; core team, and also, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll"&gt;Jaana&lt;/a&gt; who now is working for the AWS observability production team, I think. So I started my relationship with &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganmclean/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Morgan McLean&lt;/a&gt; now is the PM of &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;. He was the main person who worked for &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt;, and then he tried to make &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; the first choice for the instrumentation for &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/trace"&gt;Google Cloud Trace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring"&gt;Cloud Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;. So that's the reason why I had to work with those libraries or the project. So &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganmclean/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Morgan McLean&lt;/a&gt; was really keen on communicating with the &lt;a href="https://opentracing.io/"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt; team because the objectives of instrumentation for trace were the same in the &lt;a href="https://opentracing.io/"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt; project and &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; project. And he was really good at communicating with other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we did a really good competition with the &lt;a href="https://opentracing.io/"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt; team. And then, we decided to merge into one, so that's the origin of &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. And also, &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; had instrumentations for the metrics part. And it is a really good benefit for the &lt;a href="https://opentracing.io/"&gt;OpenTracing&lt;/a&gt; team because they only focus on distributed tracing. So our &lt;a href="https://opencensus.io/"&gt;OpenCensus&lt;/a&gt; metric part gave them a good benefit to have wider instrumentation, tracing, and metrics. So we merged. And now, the tracing part of &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; was released as GA stable 1.0. So it's good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: How long ago was that they released that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: You mean &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; tracing part GA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Yeah, the tracing spec 1.0.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So the stable spec was released six months ago. The stable spec was released in March this year. And then, recently, the Go language stable library was released. In terms of that, Java is leading the implementation. So Java's stable release was maybe June, I guess. So Java and Python already have the stable release. And now the Go is counted as the stable one as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Java is cheating, though. They've been around a long time. Java always has an advantage in these things. They have so many hooks in the JVM already. You mentioned when I spoke to you earlier about the profiling stuff that you've been working on with &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt;. It's just continuous profiling, generally. The GCP does this, but is there a feature name for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So, as you mentioned, &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; is just for one short collection of profiling. It's so confusing. So &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; is included in Go's standard library. Go users can utilize &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; as an out-of-the-box experience, but it is actually the extension of &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt;. So &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; itself is just a visualizer. So you need to have the profile data in advance of using &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt;. And then Go's standard tools include the profile collection tools as well. So that's the reason why Go's &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; is considered as a profile collection and a visualizing tool. But the original &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; itself is just a visualizer. So that's the context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what we do in &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; is that we still use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt;. But it's a kind of forked version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; because the visualization part is totally different. So we give that tool as the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/profiler"&gt;Cloud Profiler&lt;/a&gt;. So that is the product name. And then, the difference between the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/profiler"&gt;Cloud Profiler&lt;/a&gt; is that &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/profiler"&gt;Cloud Profiler&lt;/a&gt; provides the agent library for each famous programming language such as Java, Python, Node.js, and Go. And then what you need to do is to just write 5 to 10 lines of code in a new application. That launches the profile agent in your application as a subsidiary thread of the main thread. And then, that thread periodically collects the profile data of the application and then sends that data back to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/profiler"&gt;Cloud Profiler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: But it's not a separate process. It has to run in the main process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yes. In the case of Java, you can attach the external agent (JAR file is the main application) and then do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Which is why Java is cheating because you could just attach to the running process. It's like strace is tracing the thing. Okay, so we have a lot of things we talked about here. We talked a little bit about the way &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; brought together the metrics and the traces. And then we've talked a little bit about profiling data. But we left an important piece out of this conversation which I'm hearing more and more about in &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; recently, which is logs. I think it has become unpopular to talk about observability being composed of MELT or the pillars of observability. There are no pillars; observability is just all of it together. But logs are certainly important here. And it's a place where we could use a lot of standardization. I think a lot of people don't even treat their logs as data right now. They don't really use all that structured logging. Do you know anything about this, the progress of the logging piece?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So log has a long history. So I do not know the whole of them. But at least the parts that relate to&lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; logs I know some because &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; is now focusing on &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; Collector, which collects the telemetries such as trace and metrics and aggregate them in one binary, one demo, and then sends it back to each backends like for traces and for metrics. But the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; teams thought like...so we now run the Daemon for traces and metrics. And then still, the log agent is working in the same instance. But it would be great if the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; Collector can get the log information as well, then everyone can unify the whole agent that leads to the telemetry collection. So that's the start of the log part in the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then they contacted some famous log collection projects such as the &lt;a href="https://fluentbit.io/"&gt;Fluent Bit&lt;/a&gt; and also others like &lt;a href="https://github.com/observIQ/stanza"&gt;Stanza&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.syslog-ng.com/products/log-management-software/"&gt;Syslog&lt;/a&gt;, I guess. And I didn't read the whole thread of the conversation around log collection. But now, they set the &lt;a href="https://github.com/observIQ/stanza"&gt;Stanza&lt;/a&gt; as the first implementation of &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; logs. And in &lt;a href="https://github.com/observIQ/stanza"&gt;Stanza&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://observiq.com/"&gt;observIQ&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://github.com/observIQ/stanza"&gt;Stanza&lt;/a&gt; is merged under the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; log repository, so that's the status. And then, they try to standardize the format of logs based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/observIQ/stanza"&gt;Stanza&lt;/a&gt; format, such as what kind of information should be included in log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Yeah, this part has always been kind of confusing to me because I think of logs as being very rich data. I can report all kinds of things in my logs. I could report the number of cat tweets found in the last hour, for example. But it's not like we're going to have a bucket for that. There's not going to be a key that is part of the standard that is like, cat count. They're pretty free-form by their very nature. You think that that's a thing that is achievable? Certainly. But is it valuable? You think people are going to end up going off the rails anyway, or is that all just built into it? Much like we have labels where you just have a bucket of key-value whatever you want in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: I think the number with cat tweets could be the label because that totally depends upon the application. So log is basically the record of the events in the application. So there should be some mandatory fields such as timestamp, for example, because it is the most important information of the event and also the severity levels. So the importance of which is the label of the importance of the event itself? This is kind of easy information to have, easy information to come up with. But they'd like to standardize which kind of information should be included as the mandatory field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, in the era of microservices, maybe some instance know the related information should be important, especially in the case of &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, maybe then the pod information, Node information, namespace information. That information should be included in a log. So what they are trying to do is to standardize the attribute of logs in general and try to set out what information is mandatory and what is not. I'm just observing how it goes, but it's a very interesting conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: It's very interesting. I think Kubernetes is a good example of this because it's a standardization. We're trying to come to these standards, not because we want to force people to behave in any certain way, but because we're making everyone's lives easier. In the near term, I think it's hard to say that &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; has made anyone's life easier. It's new, and so there are a lot of things that change very rapidly. And there's a lot to learn, and the resources to learn those things are not there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, I've spent the last week fighting with &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; in a robot that I built where I have &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; running on a bunch of little &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; things. But when you start to understand the pieces of it, it's incredibly powerful, and I really quite like it. I am shocked by what I'm able to get away with in terms of effort of deploying a large, resilient fleet of web applications onto a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;s and blowing them away with ephemeral file systems. It's fantastic from that perspective. I have my own little cloud running on my desk, but it's very hard to get up to speed quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem is still in its very early days, and a lot of that still applies. How do you think people are going to get up to speed quickly on those? &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; has things like &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon&lt;/a&gt; running. And a lot of companies are running &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; now, so they're all very motivated. But what do you think is going to motivate people to start using these sorts of things in the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; project? How is it going to be driven to the people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: That's an interesting question. I think &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; has good features or good nature from its beginning because the motivation of starting out the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; project comes from the challenges that many instrumentation libraries or instrumentation methods had. So the reason why &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; started is because a number of APM vendors or monitoring SaaS vendors provided their own instrumentation away. And the developers struggled with applying those instrumentations into their system one by one, so that was hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So from the developer's point of view, having one single way to instrument application, I think it's good stuff. In the case that they would like to have the multiple output, for example, for standard out as well as the managed services, then what they need to do is to just write single configuration in a configuration file, and then that's it. So I think that's a good benefit for developers. And only that one gives enough motivation for developers still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: I agree with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: And also, the good thing about the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; is that they start everything from having the spec, the common spec among the many languages. So the developers can understand how those libraries are implemented and how they can use those libraries in their application because the way to instrument is always the same among the many libraries, many languages, so that gives the easier understanding of the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; libraries itself. So I think that's another good point of the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; project as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think that compared to new technologies such as &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/"&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; projects, &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; has a long history before its beginning. So now, &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; is a joint project among the many SaaS vendors and also observability-related open-source projects such as &lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://zipkin.io/"&gt;Zipkin&lt;/a&gt;. And then, in terms of the APM vendors, including your company like &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com/"&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt;, Google, AWS, &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;, or Microsoft, &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/"&gt;Dynatrace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://lightstep.com/"&gt;Lightstep&lt;/a&gt;, all of those companies are getting together to make the best solution to instrument the application. And each of those companies have their own struggles, and then they share those struggles and efforts with the community. So all the spec includes those histories and now get into one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; project itself is new, but the outcome is the summary of their long history. So from the developer point of view, though the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; seems relatively new, the idea itself, I think it's well-considered. And it looks like really common old tools such as Linux, command line, and so on. So yeah, I think it's easier for developers to start out &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; once they read the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: It's a more mature project than it might appear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yeah, maturity. In terms of the idea itself, it's mature. Though the implementation of the library is still young and not matured enough to use it in production except for traces. The idea itself is mature, so it's easy to get along with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Yeah, I'm a big fan. I've only really dipped my toe into learning about the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; project, but it's an impressive collaboration. I have a hard time thinking of a time when companies have come across all together with so much consensus around what this thing should be. Even with things like the browser wars and stuff, we've never really had so many people on the same team. And it gets this big enough snowball at some point that it becomes unstoppable where you have a choice to embrace &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; or be left behind. It's a very exciting project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of questions that I like to ask people on this show. And the first one is what you think is coming in the near future. I want you to make a prediction so that we can have this podcast again in a year, and we can tell you that you were wrong. So it has to be a risky one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: So you’re pretty sure that it's going to be a bad one, and then we can...No. But what do you think is coming for our industry or even just software generally over the next couple of years? A year maybe is too short. Five years is too long. Do you have any predictions about where things are headed, maybe in the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; space? Do you think that &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"&gt;pprof&lt;/a&gt; is going to be incorporated here, and everyone's going to have continuous profiling as part of some common spec?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So my focus is on observability, and I'm not really looking at other areas like security and so forth. So I cannot make the assumption of those areas. But in terms of observability, I think in the next couple of years, especially in the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; area, I think more and more plugins are coming into the project. For example, recently, Google announced that &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-sqlcommenter-open-source-orm-auto-instrumentation-library"&gt;Sqlcommenter&lt;/a&gt; will be merged into &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. So &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-sqlcommenter-open-source-orm-auto-instrumentation-library"&gt;Sqlcommenter&lt;/a&gt; is the open-source to put the SQL comment into the actual SQL, actual SQL issued by ORM mappers in applications or query libraries of each programming language. And then this is a good example. This is just an extension of SQL. But once it is integrated with &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;, they can attach the tracing information in the query information like SQL. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, as an example, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql"&gt;Cloud SQL&lt;/a&gt; gives the tracing information into the Google Cloud Trace. And so that gives the information around slow query on a Cloud Trace. But now, Sqlcommenter is merged into &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. So other tracing libraries can collaborate with our RDBMS solutions. So if the RDBMS backend can provide the tracing information of a specific query to the trace visualizer such as &lt;a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zipkin.io/"&gt;Zipkin&lt;/a&gt;, then developers can get the SQL query really easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I believe that in the next couple of years, &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; will be expanded in such a way. So, for example, if the security team can give information, log information, around the latency of encryptions, or like, I don't know, the number of suspicious attacks from the attackers, I don't know…So every single observability-related information can be an extension of the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. So I think in the coming couple of years, &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; can have more and more SIG team in the project. And then they can be established, expanded more and more in a variety of areas. So that's my expected expectation of &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: This SQL feature is very interesting to me. So the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-sqlcommenter-open-source-orm-auto-instrumentation-library"&gt;Sqlcommenter&lt;/a&gt; that we're talking about is concretely a request ID. And we could include a lot of other things, but this query happened on this request. It suddenly allows me to see every request from every query instead of what is often happening now where you're kind of bundling up the queries because that's a lot of information. You run EXPLAIN PLANS on all of these queries. And then you dump all of that into a payload that goes with your telemetry data rather than just being able to pull it out of the database because it's in the query comments on any given query. That's the thing that's merged right now? Sqlcommenter was just recently merged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So it's announced they will merge in the near future. And so, the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-sqlcommenter-open-source-orm-auto-instrumentation-library"&gt;Sqlcommenter&lt;/a&gt; is located under Google's Organization in GitHub. But now, &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; is preparing for the place to the migration, preferred migration. And also, the &lt;a href="%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; team is now asking for the maintenance and approvals of the Sqlcommenter after it is merged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So it's pretty much new and ready to be merged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: It's an exciting project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Okay, I have another question for you, and then we're going to call it a show. But this one's maybe a little bit more personal. This is about what you might tell yourself starting out in your career. I imagine that there are a lot of people out there listening who aspire to be in your shoes today. You've worked at Google for more than a decade. You have a long and successful career. What advice do you have for them getting started? Or what advice do you wish you had for yourself? What would you tell yourself just starting out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: I do not think of myself as a successful engineer, but I managed to survive until today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: And the reason why I could survive is because always I tried to enjoy the technology that I work on, regardless of my will. For example, when I joined the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; team in the developer relations team, the area I focused on, the observability, was not my choice. I was assigned to work on the observability area because not many people were working on it on that day. At the time, I did not have much attention to observability itself. But I felt like, why don't I give it a shot? And then I started out researching what observability is, and also, what kind of products are around that area, and also, what kind of companies and people are there. And now I'm pretty much enjoying observability itself. And I am so excited to talk about it like now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, before joining the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/"&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; team, I was always like that. So I had worked on &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; for a while. And then before that, I had never worked on voice command-related devices or applications. And then, I started learning how to design the application based on the voice, only voice. That was a good experience for me because that gave me a lot of ideas around accessibility, for example. And then that kind of view gave me a good idea on considering what the information should be when we give specific information to other people. So I think the key is to enjoy the area you work on and make everything fun by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: And not necessarily only work on the things that you think are fun already because that's how you stretch yourself. You find the new things that are fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: That's very smart advice. I'll take it. I'm going to go and learn how to do some &lt;a href="https://assistant.google.com/"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; programming now because I feel like the cat tweet analyzer needs to exist. It's an important project. The world needs more cat tweet analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yeah. I'll personally watch how it goes. So yeah, looking forward to more features to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Please follow the repo. It's going to be a great one. I really appreciate you coming on the show, Yoshi. Do you have any parting thoughts for our listeners, or should we just call it a day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: So if you come up with any ideas or any opinions, then just feel free to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ymotongpoo"&gt;reach out to me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I think Jonan will put a link to my account somewhere here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: I will, absolutely. We will have all of the links in the descriptions. And it's nice of you to invite people to reach out if they have questions about any of the things you talked about. They can reach out to you on...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ymotongpoo"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is the best way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: Yeah, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ymotongpoo"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is the best way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: All right. Well, thank you very much, Yoshi. I hope you have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshi: I'm glad. I had a good talk with you. Thank you for the invitation. I'm looking forward to talking with you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of the rest of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;therelicans.com&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, most anything The Relicans get up to online will be on that site. We'll see you next week. Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a direct message chat with a contact list using TalkJS</title>
      <author>Tawanda</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:15:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/talkjs/create-a-direct-message-chat-with-a-contact-list-using-talkjs-2g2g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/talkjs/create-a-direct-message-chat-with-a-contact-list-using-talkjs-2g2g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will create a direct message chat with a contact list using the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com"&gt;TalkJS chat API&lt;/a&gt;. The chat will display a list of contacts from which a user can select a contact and open a &lt;code&gt;chatbox&lt;/code&gt; with a conversation (and a history of that conversation if it exists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the functionality you see on platforms like Linkedin, WhatsApp and Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-our-chat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up our chat
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we will do is set up a basic HTML page on which we will display our chat. On this page we will embed the TalkJS API in a script as specified in the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/docs/Getting_Started/"&gt;Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start by creating a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; to hold our chatbox and the contact list, using the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"display: flex; justify-content: center"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- container element in which TalkJS will display a chat UI --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"talkjs-container"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width: 30%;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Loading chat...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;div id="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;contacts-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Contacts&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; will have two &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;s within it with &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;s of &lt;code&gt;talkjs-container&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;contact-list&lt;/code&gt; respectively. We also apply some basic styling so that the &lt;code&gt;contacts-list&lt;/code&gt; div floats to the right side of the &lt;code&gt;talkjs-container&lt;/code&gt; div.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-contact-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The contact list
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;contact-list&lt;/code&gt; div will be populated by the list of contacts we can chat with. In production it is likely that these users will be retrieved from a database or another location. In our case we will create an array of hardcoded users. The array will contain objects of the users, each with an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;photoUrl&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we add the following code to our script:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lisa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-1.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Alice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-2.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Tina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-3.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-4.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Pete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-5.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Dana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-6.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar-7.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After setting up up our array of users, the next step is to display them in the &lt;code&gt;contacts-list&lt;/code&gt; div.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To display the contacts list we will loop through the &lt;code&gt;contactsList&lt;/code&gt; array and use the contact objects inside that array to create a contacts list with usernames and profile pictures. We will also make the contacts clickable. Finally the list is rendered in the &lt;code&gt;contacts-list&lt;/code&gt; div.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Display contacts list on page&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Get contacts list container from the DOM&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsWrapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;contacts-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Loop through array and display each contact in contact-list div&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Extract contact details&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//create img tag to hold contact pic, give it a class name (for styling purposes) and add photo to it&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactPhoto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactPhoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;contact-photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactPhoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create div to hold contact Name and add name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameDiv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;contact-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create contact parent div and add to it contactPhotoDiv and usernameDiv&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;contact-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactPhoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have loaded our contact list, let us add some styling to make it look nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling-the-contact-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling the contact list
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are going to be doing a bit of styling, we will open a &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag at the top of our page and put all our CSS code there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to reduce the size of the profile pictures, make them rounded and also float the names to the right of the profile pictures. We will also add a &lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-class so that the user can easily see which contact they can select, and change the cursor to a pointer when it hovers over a contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us add the following code to our page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;#contacts-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#d0d8dc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;6px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;510px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#111&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Open Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;#contacts-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#e7ecee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-top-left-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-top-right-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;13.3px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.contact-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.contact-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#e7ecee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.contact-name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contact list will look as shown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CXKTEIRy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c884sx7xvazgvj5c6us0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CXKTEIRy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c884sx7xvazgvj5c6us0.png" alt="Contact List" width="508" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loading-the-chatbox"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loading the chatbox
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After displaying the contact list we now want to initialize and load our chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjruMDj-_jzAhUSTcAKHfcjBAIQFnoECAYQAQ&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FLearn%2FJavaScript%2FAsynchronous&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0Pgg-C8gmgw5YSRDpbuz6G"&gt;asynchronously&lt;/a&gt; calling the &lt;code&gt;Talk&lt;/code&gt; object. Once the promise is resolved, the rest of our code is loaded.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let us create a user called &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; who will be able to interact with the users from our array. As mentioned before, in production this user will likely be extracted from a database, or sent over a network in a data format such as the array above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Demi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;photoUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://talkjs.com/images/avatar.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We then use the &lt;code&gt;appId&lt;/code&gt; to start and authenticate our chat &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/JavaScript_Chat_SDK/Session/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Session&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the TalkJS servers. This &lt;code&gt;appId&lt;/code&gt; is found in the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard"&gt;TalkJS dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, and without it the chat will not load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we create and mount the chatbox where the conversation will be displayed:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chatbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;talkSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createChatbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chatbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;talkjs-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now want to create conversations between the user &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; and each of the users in the &lt;code&gt;contactsList&lt;/code&gt; array. Here we make use of the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.map()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method which creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create conversationBuilder objects for each user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;talkUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;talkSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getOrCreateConversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;oneOnOneId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;talkUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setParticipant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setParticipant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;talkUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-the-chatbox-to-the-contact-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting the chatbox to the contact list
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to link our contacts to the appropriate chatbox, so that when a contact is selected a chatbox of that particular conversation loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this we need to get all instances of the &lt;code&gt;contact-container&lt;/code&gt; class from the DOM, so we can listen in when any of the contacts is clicked. Then we add a &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; event listener to the resultant array and create a callback which is called when the event is triggered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsListDivs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;contact-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsListDivs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chatbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;conversation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our final chat looks and functions as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QlW3_e2V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aaty3kdq5j0qi4rc5xqn.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QlW3_e2V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aaty3kdq5j0qi4rc5xqn.gif" alt="Chat with contact list" width="880" height="476"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the full code for this tutorial.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;d0d8dc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;510&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;111&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Open Sans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;13.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usernameDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactsWrapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contactContainerDiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create user "me"&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Day 26 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: A Life Full of Hardships</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:07:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rammina/day-26-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-a-life-full-of-hardships-a83</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-26-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-a-life-full-of-hardships-a83</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRIGGER WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; The content of this post can be &lt;em&gt;emotionally disturbing&lt;/em&gt;. I politely ask you to &lt;em&gt;turn back if you don't want to suffer from negative emotional reactions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was an extremely rough day. I'm even having trouble writing this down. However, I still managed to do what was required for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#suicidal-tendencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Suicidal Tendencies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife has been suffering from severe anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies for how many years by now. And I'm no different either. I have severe RSI on both hands; I've always fought an uphill battle in trying to become a developer. Our lives are definitely ones full of hardships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, today was pretty bad in terms of emotional distress. My wife and I were already going through so much the past month, and we're not exactly in the best state mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry you had to meet me.&lt;br&gt;
It's something that should have probably not happened.&lt;br&gt;
I wanted you to be happy, but instead, it's like this.&lt;br&gt;
So many others could have been good for you.&lt;br&gt;
I really wish life could have been different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we've had a really bad interaction which pushed both of us downwards. Instead of providing emotional support and respecting her boundaries, I just made her (and myself) feel a lot worse and she was seriously talking about suicide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is she fine? I don't know, and only tomorrow will tell. All I can do is continue doing what I'm supposed to and be there by her side at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#all-journeys-have-hardships"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  All Journeys have Hardships
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn't really the place to be talking about this, and I'm not asking for help or advice either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just see myself writing down my story for these 100 days of coding. These are all the things I've done and went through. And no one's journey is going to be always happy. I'm sure most people go through multiple tough times in their careers, whether be it personal or professional hardships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's move on to my daily report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yesterday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yesterday
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about Next.js web crawling, indexing, and rendering strategies. I wrote Agile user stories for my company website. I read about team arrangements for multiple Scrum teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I learned and worked on today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished the official Next.js tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learned about performance and core web vitals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Largest Contentful Paint&lt;/code&gt; - measures the time it takes for the largest element to load in a page (loading performance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;First Input Delay&lt;/code&gt; - perception of an end-user's experience while interacting with the page. (interactivity and responsiveness).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift&lt;/code&gt; - measure of a site's overall layout stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learned about using &lt;strong&gt;Google Lighthouse&lt;/strong&gt; to monitor the quality of a webpage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scrum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scrum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wrote user stories and tasks for my company website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished reading &lt;a href="https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/"&gt;Scrum and XP from the Trenches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read about scrum of scrums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with distributed teams is a lot more difficult than in-person because of communication issues, lack of proximity, different cultures, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish everyone the best, and that you overcome the difficulties you face. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open source HLS proxy library for manifest manipulation</title>
      <author>Jonas Birmé</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 12:56:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/video/open-source-hls-proxy-library-for-manifest-manipulation-1e9n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/video/open-source-hls-proxy-library-for-manifest-manipulation-1e9n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a number of use cases where HLS manifest manipulation techniques are applicable. Multi CDN switching, server-side ad insertion, looping or truncating a VOD, to mention a few. The fundamental principle is that you need some HLS proxy between the video player and the original HLS you wish to modify somehow. As this is a very common component in all these use cases we have developed and open sourced an NPM library, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Eyevinn/hls-proxy"&gt;hls-proxy&lt;/a&gt;, that takes care of that. In this post we will describe how to use it and examples of some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get started
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-proxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once installed in your NodeJS project you can start by creating a &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt; that could look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@eyevinn/hls-proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proxy server is built on &lt;a href="https://www.fastify.io"&gt;fastify.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handlers object implements the following interface:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IHandlers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;originHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IProxyRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;masterManifestHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IProxyRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m3u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mediaManifestHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IProxyRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m3u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;segmentRedirectHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IProxyRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-originhandler-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;originHandler&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This handler is called on every request handled by the proxy. The function implementing this handler is expected to return the base URL for where the proxy can fetch the original manifest. For example if the video player requests &lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;proxy&amp;gt;/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;originHandler&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology&lt;/code&gt; the proxy will fetch the master manifest from &lt;code&gt;https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-mastermanifesthandler-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;masterManifestHandler&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This handler is called after the proxy has fetched the master manifest from the origin. It provides the original request received by the proxy, base URL set by the &lt;code&gt;originHandler&lt;/code&gt; and a parsed M3U object (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Eyevinn/node-m3u8"&gt;@eyevinn/m3u8&lt;/a&gt;). It is expected to return an HLS master manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-mediamanifesthandler-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;mediaManifestHandler&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the &lt;code&gt;masterManifestHandler&lt;/code&gt; this is called after the proxy has fetched the manifest from the origin. In this case when the media manifest is retrieved. Also in this case a parsed M3U object is provided to the handler. The handler is expected to return an HLS media manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-segmentredirecthandler-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;segmentRedirectHandler&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the segment URLs are not pointing directly to another server the proxy will receive all requests for segments. If the segment URLs are not rewritten by the &lt;code&gt;mediaManifestHandler&lt;/code&gt; this handler needs to be implemented. It is expected to return the URL for where the segment can be found. The proxy will respond with a 302 redirect to the video player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-use-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example use cases
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will present some example use cases where this proxy can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multi-cdn-switching"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multi CDN switching
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be several reasons to have a multi CDN strategy. It could be cost related, reliability related or just pure business rules related. What ever the reason using an HLS proxy and manifest manipulation is one way of switching between the CDNs. The first example below shows how you can do that with this HLS proxy-library using 302 segment redirects. That gives you the possibility to switch in the middle of the stream even when playing a VOD (the media manifest is only fetched once).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@eyevinn/hls-proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cdnSelector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Make decision on which CDN that is best to use here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;originHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cdnSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;segmentRedirectHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirectUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;raw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;redirectUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Example: http://localhost:8000/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example that instead rewrites the media manifest have the benefit that the proxy does not have to handle each segment request by the video player, thus reducing the load a bit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@eyevinn/hls-proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cdnSelector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Make decision on which CDN that is best to use here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;originHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cdnSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;mediaManifestHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m3u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// rewrite segment URLs to point to chosen CDN&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m3u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlaylistItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newSegmentUri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;basePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newSegmentUri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m3u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Example: http://localhost:8000/VINN.mp4/master.m3u8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#looping-a-vod"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Looping a VOD
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us say that you have a VOD as a slate that you use to fill gaps in a schedule. Instead of having a set of slates with different durations you can have a 3 seconds slate that you loop instead. This is something that also can be achieved using HLS proxy and manifest manipulation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Example (2 reps): http://localhost:8000/slate-consuo2.mp4/master.m3u8?r=2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@eyevinn/hls-proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSRepeatVod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@eyevinn/hls-repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HLSProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;originHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Origin where the VOD is found&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://maitv-vod.lab.eyevinn.technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hlsVod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getMediaManifest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;raw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;segmentRedirectHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;raw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;baseUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition to the HLS proxy library this example uses an HLS &lt;a href="https://github.com/Eyevinn/hls-repeat"&gt;manifest manipulation library&lt;/a&gt; that creates a new HLS VOD by repeating the contents of another HLS VOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inserting-a-bumper-or-ad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inserting a bumper or ad
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inserting a bumper or pre-roll ad is another use case for the HLS proxy but we are leaving that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All above mentioned code and libraries are available as open source. More tools and libraries that are open source can be found on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/Eyevinn"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone I am Amr Eldessouki founder of HTMLgApp &amp;amp; URLgapp&lt;br&gt;
I am happy to present weather.io &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vC0O-RCh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjia1npn9dnuwgcfzzsh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vC0O-RCh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjia1npn9dnuwgcfzzsh.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="335"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ZVNDHr9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9v62z32jwwkn55384sif.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ZVNDHr9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9v62z32jwwkn55384sif.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="688"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;weather.io created by &lt;br&gt;
A talented developer Yash Waghmare &lt;br&gt;
Just with his Html , CSS and Javascript files, He used our service to convert this web app code to an android app . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTMLgApp check it : &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://urlgapp.com/home/htmlgapp"&gt;https://urlgapp.com/home/htmlgapp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he uploaded the project files , app logo , email and last thing is app name , and waited for 5 minutes to get his apk , app bundle and google play key for free &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to take a random group of generated apps every day and publish it for free in a shared account on google play store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yash Waghmare's weather.io app is now live on google play store &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urlgapp.app1635785018853"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urlgapp.app1635785018853&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also do this easily &lt;br&gt;
converting your Html , Css and Js code to an android app &lt;br&gt;
Get started now its for free !! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://urlgapp.com/home/htmlgapp"&gt;https://urlgapp.com/home/htmlgapp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe That Your Skills Will Change The World &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you .  &lt;/p&gt;
