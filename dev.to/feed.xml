      <guid>https://dev.to/byteslash/deta-space-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-the-future-52fj</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is not sponsored or biased in any way. I liked the idea behind the product and hence wanted to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deta.sh/"&gt;Deta&lt;/a&gt; was a company founded just over 2 years ago and it has been providing free Cloud solutions since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-deta-space"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Deta Space?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deta Space is a new product from Deta which provides you with your personal cloud hosted by Deta where you can run sandboxed versions of certain apps. It is a relatively new concept but seems to have great potential. Here the developers don't have our data so they cannot sell it. Deta still has our data but in this case, we just need to trust one company rather than trusting a bunch of other companies or developers. You can see Deta's privacy policy &lt;a href="https://www.deta.sh/privacy"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates are on an opt-in basis so if you don't want to update to a newer version of an app, you can choose not to. There is no option to downgrade though but that can be added in the future and I hope they do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z4nzS8jI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632666001421/sATiXbC8w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z4nzS8jI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632666001421/sATiXbC8w.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see all the data stored by an app on a per-app basis through Deta's dashboard. To do so, click on the 3-dot menu on the app's icon and click "My Data" and you will be redirected to a page where you can see all the stored data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  For Developers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iB90cYU9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632666204628/bBAjelQfY.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iB90cYU9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632666204628/bBAjelQfY.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deta Space also provides a marketplace for apps where developers can publish apps. Right now, there are only 5 but as this concept gets more popular and developers start to build more apps compatible with Deta Space, this marketplace is going to expand. You can see the marketplace &lt;a href="https://deta.space/discovery"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deta aims to make it easy for developers to make applications for Deta Space by completely managing the infrastructure from servers, security, data to payments. You can learn more about it &lt;a href="https://www.deta.sh/space"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-deta-space-can-get-better"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Deta Space can get better
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see teams using Deta Space as a future use case. Deta Space only supports spaces for individual users now, but later it can be expanded to provide a space that multiple users can access. Also, only one instance of an app can be created currently but the ability to create multiple instances will be a dealbreaker for some.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey into Technical Writing</title>
      <author>Anish De</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 09:47:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/anishde12020/my-journey-into-technical-writing-6i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/anishde12020/my-journey-into-technical-writing-6i</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-i-started-writing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before I started writing
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interested in tech in general from a very young age and have been expanding my knowledge from watching videos and reading articles for a long time. I used to read articles written across many technical news outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/"&gt;GSMArena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. Programming was something I started learning a few years back but I didn't read as many articles about it. About a year back, I found out &lt;a href="https://dev.to/"&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt; and that is when I started reading a lot of articles on programming. As a side note, I have a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY-rVWTIsN-G7s81C89SzkA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; which I started last year and it has been quite a good experience. I have not uploaded any videos for about 3 months now but I aim to resume sometime in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starting-with-technical-writing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starting with technical writing
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never wrote an article on DEV until I found out about Hashnode back in April of this year. Hashnode was a great place to start my blog so I made a publication and wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.anishde.dev/cryptography-with-python-using-fernet"&gt;my first article&lt;/a&gt;. I also cross-posted that article to DEV and I got quite a lot of views on that article. I liked it and then wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.anishde.dev/the-random-library-in-python"&gt;my second article&lt;/a&gt; a few days later. Note that I was still making videos on my YouTube channel at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-more-interested"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting more interested
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing those two articles, I didn't write any for a few months and that was because I didn't know what to write about and I was still not very confident if I would be able to do good. Things changed with the &lt;a href="https://townhall.hashnode.com/auth0-hackathon"&gt;August Hashnode x Auth0 BootCamp&lt;/a&gt; where I made an application and wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.anishde.dev/easy-comments"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; as a part of my submission. Suddenly, I got more interested in technical writing and I have written 8 blog posts in the last 3 weeks. Hashnode's &lt;a href="https://hashnode.com/challenge/2articles1week"&gt;2articles1week&lt;/a&gt; challenge has got me into writing consistently and the &lt;a href="https://hashnode.com/bootcamp"&gt;Technical Writing Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; has taught me a lot about writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's next?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aim to write more articles about programming and tech from now on. I also plan on reviving my YouTube channel with videos about programming, let me know your thoughts in the comments section. I am also working on a portfolio site right now and will be working on more projects and learning more. &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; is just 3 days away and I plan on participating in Hacktoberfest as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Why and How of Websites for Writers</title>
      <author>Otis Anderson</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 09:13:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/otisons/the-why-and-how-of-websites-for-writers-59de</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/otisons/the-why-and-how-of-websites-for-writers-59de</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#provide-an-authors-shop-window-for-editors-clients-and-readers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Provide an Author's Shop Window for Editors, Clients and Readers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many writers feel that a professional website is too hard (to build themselves) or too expensive (to use a web designer). That might have been so once, but not any more.&lt;br&gt;
Readers, editors and clients are being conditioned to expect writers to have a website, and now it's fast becoming something that writers can't afford to leave for another day. Although they understand this, thousands of freelance writers or authors have put off creating &lt;a href="https://worldscholarshipforum.com/paper-writing-service/"&gt;paper writing service&lt;/a&gt; websites because of a seemingly insurmountable problem: they simply have no idea where to start. They know nothing about building a website – and as for the other option, hiring a web designer to do it instead... isn't it prohibitively expensive to get a professional to do it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--41QXpZbc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/60p8fnt4pzl0id6rw7ht.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--41QXpZbc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/60p8fnt4pzl0id6rw7ht.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#userfriendly-website-templates-xsitepro-and-wordpress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  User-Friendly Website Templates: XSitePro and WordPress
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily things have evolved to the stage where writers can actually have a good shot at building a professional-looking website on their own. This is thanks to software that provides well-designed templates, so the site doesn't have to have that 'home-made' look. One very easy website builder is XSitePro. This software has a great many more bells and whistles than a writer is likely to need, because it was created with internet marketers in mind. However, just ignore the 'extras' until they are needed (if ever) - the main thing that a writer needs to know is that by using this software, it's possible to come up with a nice-looking site in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creators of XSitePro even offer a free header tool, XHeader, that anyone can use to create their own personalised site header graphic. It's worth downloading this just to play around with it - especially since writers can create all sorts of graphics for their sites with this tool. It's easy to export the results in standard image files like jpegs or gifs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XSitePro website design software will create a very professional-looking site for any writer, but the software is not free. On the other hand, writers on a tight budget will find that PageBreeze (which is free to download) has all the functionality they need to build a website, but the trade-off is that there is much more of a learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if an author wants to have a writer's website, but doesn't have the time or inclination to build a website themselves? There are two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hire a web designer to build it, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use an online website builder (where the writer signs into a website then uses the tools on the host website to create pages and upload photos.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consider-starting-a-blog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consider Starting a Blog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a very easy and inexpensive way to make a start on becoming visible on the Internet is to start a blog. In fact, many writers have actually chosen to convert their original websites to a blog format. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blog allows interaction with readers and other writers; they can post comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blog can be customised to look like a website - writers can add extra pages and links at will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress"&gt;WordPress blogs&lt;/a&gt; are easy to use, highly customisable, and there are lots of useful plug-ins available (to combat spam, upload photos, add links to popular social networking pages and so on). WordPress is easily customisable so that the site looks more like a traditional website than a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#doityourself-website-or-pay-a-website-designer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do-It-Yourself Website or Pay a Website Designer?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a writer who can see the benefits of having his or her own website, the first step is to decide how it is going to happen: DIY or use a designer. A few years ago it could become very expensive to have a website professionally designed and uploaded to the Internet. Now there are many website designers who will do this for a very reasonable fee. For example: website designer Gail Breese specalises in creating websites for writers. Her website shows a dozen or so of these sites, along with comments from clients. To find a website designer in your country, just do a search using a phrase like "website designer for writer's website" and see what comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plan-the-content-for-your-writers-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plan the Content for Your Writer's Website
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to plan the content. A good place to start is by spending a few hours looking at other writers' websites – and there are thousands of them around. Check out their home pages, their 'about me' page, and the layout of the site. Look at sites that are based on a blog format as well as traditional websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bookmark any sites that appeal because of the colours, design, or content. This will be useful for writers who design their own sites as well as those to opt to use a website design service. Scroll to the bottom of the home page to see if the site designer has been credited – if so, it's easy to look them up on the Web. Finally, don't be afraid to use the 'Contact Me' section of a website you like to ask the owner who built the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most writers, it is well worth taking the time – and if necessary, investing some money - to create a professional Internet presence. Don't put it off any longer. Make a start today by investigating the various options for a writer's website, and tomorrow... that website might be a reality!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#to-find-other-good-websitebuilding-resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  To Find Other Good Website-Building Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other good website design software and resources for those creating their own paper writing &lt;a href="https://writemypaperbro.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and blog, try entering terms like 'website design software' and 'graphics for websites' into a search engine. There are new programs being created all the time, and one of them might be exactly what is needed!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i have made this website using bootstrap, you can use code and you can download book and also add book in that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-code-all-in-one"&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Hacktoberfest 2021: Let the Contributions Begin! </title>
      <author>Vishnupriya Bhandaram</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 08:56:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appsmith/hacktoberfest-2021-let-the-contributions-begin-3gal</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appsmith/hacktoberfest-2021-let-the-contributions-begin-3gal</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time indeed does fly because it feels just like yesterday when we hosted our first ever Hacktoberfest last year! And what a year it has been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started &lt;a href="https://www.appsmith.com/"&gt;Appsmith&lt;/a&gt; because we wanted to create a developer-first product to make an engineer’s life easy. From being a small, little-known project on &lt;a href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, we now have 5K stars. This wouldn’t have been possible without our community; apart from giving us incredible feedback, they also contributed immensely to our codebase, from contributing new integrations to helping solve bugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have over 100 contributors, and we want to expand our community (that means you!), empowering them to contribute to a project that will always remain developer-first. And so, we’re back again this year for an exciting month-long virtual festival supporting open-source projects. We love it because it’s celebratory and community-oriented! At Appsmith, we genuinely believe open-source can take the way we build things to new heights. And our commitment to the community will never waver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, we are kicking off the &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.appsmith.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfest 2021&lt;/a&gt;. In the run-up to the actual code-fest, there are going to be many talks! We will be bringing together folks from other awesome projects to talk about Hacktoberfest and Open Source. Be sure to check these out. You will definitely get to learn more about how to get involved in open-source projects. And yes! We’re ready to swag it out, too, for every valid PR! And contributors who submit more than 4 PRs and invite others to contribute to our repository will get a special prize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to contribute to the issues on Appsmith’s repository on Github. Be sure to check contribution guidelines, review, and merge policies. Please note that not all pull requests will count towards Hacktoberfest 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way for users to become contributors. And it’s both a fun and rewarding experience. Sure, it can be scary to begin, and many think that only code that implements significant features matters. Well, I am here to tell you that it’s not true. We believe that no contribution is too small. Bug fixes, documentation updates, submitting articles are all fantastic ways of participating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacktoberfest is open to all: Students, developers, anyone really. Background no bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, this year, we’ve included several newbie-friendly issues in the challenge to give a warm welcome to first-timers. If you’ve still got some doubts about participating or need some queries answered, head over to our Hacktoberfest channel on &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/rBTTVJp"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, and we will be happy to help you out!  To know more about how you can participate in this event, take a look at our &lt;a href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;Contributor Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Hacking! 🐱‍💻&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking Page Views in SvelteKit: Intersection Observer</title>
      <author>Rodney Lab</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 08:49:46 +0000</pubDate>

  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%96%B1-tracking-scroll-events-in-sveltekit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🖱 Tracking Scroll Events in SvelteKit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we look at how to make tracking page views in SvelteKit easy.  You might have a blog and want to add a view counter to improve user experience.  You might also want to keep track of which articles or pages on a website get read right to the end.  This will give stakeholders a better impression of what content works well.  Although we focus on a page view example, the techniques we look at here can be used to track a wider set of scroll events.  As an example, you may want to &lt;a href="https://rodneylab.com/lazy-loading-iframes-sveltekit/"&gt;know when an iframe is about to come into the visible viewport to trigger a lazy load&lt;/a&gt;.  Finally, you might want to change a header component based on which section of the page the user is currently viewing.  All of these problems can be solved using the Intersection Observer API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example we will consider the page viewed once the user has scrolled the post banner image completely out of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wddjaCga--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ll1uy9g9dftddhb4yg6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wddjaCga--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ll1uy9g9dftddhb4yg6.png" alt="Tracking Page Views in SvelteKit: Intersection Observer: Screenshot show top of blog post page with a navigation bar up top and a large postbanner image just below"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intersection-observer-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔭 Intersection Observer API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"&gt;Intersection Observer API&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to make tracking scroll event simpler, it can be a little daunting, so we will try to break it down here.  We will end with some SvelteKit code which you can use as a starting point for your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-iframe-endraw-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;iframe&lt;/code&gt; Example
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially we use the Intersection Observer API, to tell us whether an element is in view or not.  This element would be the iframe in the case we were lazy loading an iframe and wanted to know when it was in view.  As well as the element we are tracking we have a reference frame, the root element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the root element is the viewport.  So we track whether the observed element (the iframe in our example) is inside the root element.  In the case of a lazy loading iframe, if we wanted to maximise user experience, we would start lazy loading the iframe before it came into the root element (the viewport in our case).  To do this we might say trigger the lazy load when the iframe is within 100 px of the bottom of the root element, so it is not yet visible, but will be visible as soon a the user scrolls up just anothe 100 pixels.  In this case the &lt;code&gt;rootMargin&lt;/code&gt; parameter is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ad-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ad Example
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the iframe example, we want to trigger as soon as the first pixel of the iframe enters our (extended) root element.  If we were placing an ad on our site and want to record the number of views of the ad, we might consider the add viewed once say 90% of it is visible in the viewport.  Here we would not need to extend the root element as with the iframe.  But we would want to trigger once 90% was in view, rather than the very first pixel and can do this by using the &lt;code&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note on the Intersection Observer is that it is triggered in either direction.  Meaning, by default, with the iframe example.  With the iframe initially out of view, the user scrolls down and the event is triggered (iframe switches from being outside the root element to being inside). If the user now scrolls up again, a fresh event is triggered (iframe switches from being inside the reference element to outside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, when the iframe is in view and the user scrolls right down to the bottom of the page, so the iframe is no longer visible, another event is triggered (iframe switches from being inside the root element to being outside).  Taking this into account, depending on the use case, you probably want to disable the observer once the first event is triggered.  In the iframe example, you only need to lazy load it once!  In the ad example, the advertiser might accuse you of fraud if you count a view (and bill them for it) when the ad enters the viewport and another when it leaves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-rootmargin-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;rootMargin&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root margin can be used to grow or shrink the root element.  Think of it like a CSS margin when you set parameters.  That said, you can only specify in units of pixels or a percentage (also, be sure to write &lt;code&gt;0px&lt;/code&gt;, rather than just &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;).  Why would you want to grow or shrink the root element?  By default the root element is the visible viewport.  If we want to the observer to trigger a lazy load of an iframe, it makes sense to trigger before the iframe enters the viewport, to give it time to load and improve user experience.  Here growing the root element helps.  Let's say we went for this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rootMargin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0px 0px 100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We interpret this as we would a CSS margin, so the first &lt;code&gt;0px&lt;/code&gt; means apply a top margin of zero (i.e. do nothing with the top of the root element).  The second &lt;code&gt;0px&lt;/code&gt; refers to left and right margin, again we do nothing.  The &lt;code&gt;100px&lt;/code&gt; refers to the bottom margin.  We are saying grow the root element by shifting the bottom of it out 100 pixels.  This is just what we need; by growing the root element, we can trigger the observation earlier and anticipate the iframe coming into the view, getting ready a touch sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this parameter works like a CSS margin so a negative value will decrease the size of the root element while a positive value increases it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-threshold-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; option just controls how much of the observed element needs to be visible for an event to be triggered.  For the iframe example, we can keep it at the default 0, meaning as soon as the first pixel enters the root element, we trigger an observation.  For the ad example, we might try somehting like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rootMargin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we need to have the observed element 90% visible to trigger.  Rememember that triggers work both ways.  So if we are scrolling the observer element into view and it goes from the top 89% being visible to the top 91% being visible, we have a trigger.  If we continue scrolling, we might get to a point where only the bottom 91% is visible.  If we continue scrolling, we will trigger another event once less than the bottom 90% is visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that I explained it well enough!  Let me know if there's some element I can improve on.  That's enough theory for now.  Let's code up an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tracking-page-views-in-sveltekit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🧱 Tracking Page Views in SvelteKit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's leave behind our iframe and ad examples and look at a page view.  We have a blog and want to know how many times each post gets viewed.  We could trigger a view as soon as the page loads.  Though what happens if the user clicked the wrong link and immediately presses the back button?  We would count a view, when the user didn't event read the first sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality you would want to trigger a view once the user scrolls past let's say 25%, 50% or 75% of the article into view.  You would choose the threshold based best-suited to your needs. We'll keep it simple here.  We assume you write semantic HTML and have exactly one &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; element on your blog post pages.  We trigger a view once the user scrolls the first child element of the main element out of view.  So let's say we have a structure somthing like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;picture&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        ...
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/picture&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Article Title&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;First sentence&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first child element of the main element is the picture, so once the user scrolls past that, we trigger a view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wddjaCga--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ll1uy9g9dftddhb4yg6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wddjaCga--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ll1uy9g9dftddhb4yg6.png" alt="Tracking Page Views in SvelteKit: Intersection Observer: Screenshot show top of blog post page with a navigation bar up top and a large post banner image just below"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we know what our metric is, let's write some Svelte!  We'll create a component just for the intersection observer and place it in its own file.  Although the content is in a &lt;code&gt;.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file, it will not actually render anything in our example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onDestroy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;svelte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;$app/env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Intersection Observer view event triggered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleIntersect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isIntersecting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unobserve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rootMargin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;100% 0% -100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleIntersect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstElementChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onDestroy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;disconnect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-closer-look-at-the-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Closer Look at the Code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not as daunting as it might first look.  Let's break it down and see why.  First we import &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;onDestroy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;browser&lt;/code&gt;.  You might already know &lt;code&gt;browser&lt;/code&gt; is a SvelteKit inbuilt boolean which returns true when our code is running in the browser and false, on the server.  &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onDestroy&lt;/code&gt; let us create code that only needs to be run once, as the component is created or once no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;handleView&lt;/code&gt; function is lines &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; contains the code we would normally run on a view.  This would involve updating the view counter in the UI and also letting the database know there was a new view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create an &lt;code&gt;observer&lt;/code&gt; variable and want to access it both in &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt; and in &lt;code&gt;onDestroy&lt;/code&gt;.  For that reason we declare it without assigning a value outside of both those functions, so that in can de accessed from within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intersection-observer-options"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intersection Observer Options
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;onMount&lt;/code&gt; function contains the substance of our component.  First let's look at line &lt;code&gt;21&lt;/code&gt;.  Here we define the options.  We set a threshold of 1, meaning we trigger the intersection when we go from the picture being less than 100% visible to being 100% visible or vice versa. This does not sound like it will do what we want it to but let's carry on anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we are increasing the top margin by 100% (also in line &lt;code&gt;21&lt;/code&gt;), this makes the root element bigger.  So if we have a viewport height of 812 px, our root element now starts 812 px above the top of the viewport and ends at the bottom of the view port.  Next, we make no change to the left and right root margin, but decrease the bottom margin by 100%.  Now the bottom margin essentially moves to the top of the view port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have we done here? We have shifted the entire root element so that it is off screen, standing on top of the viewport.  This is actually quite convenient for our use case.  Remember we want to know when our observed element scrolls off the top of the visible viewport.  Now (because of our margin adjustments), when that happens, the entire element will be in our shifted rootElement.  When the last pixel of the picture scrolls up out of view, 100% of the picture will be in our shifted root element.  This is why we set the trigger to 1 —  once 100% of the picture is in the  shifted rootElement, we want to trigger an intersection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-an-intersection-observer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating an Intersection Observer
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line &lt;code&gt;22&lt;/code&gt; we create the Intersection Observer, using the options we just defined.  As well as the options we pass a callback function.  This is called when an intersection is observed. The next lines find the element we want to observe and tell the Intersection Observer to observe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intersection-observer-callback"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intersection Observer Callback
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have our callback function: &lt;code&gt;handleIntersect&lt;/code&gt;.  The API passes in two parameters which we will use: &lt;code&gt;entries&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;observer&lt;/code&gt;.  Entries is an array, in our case it will only ever have one entry.  That is because we defined a single threshold.  You can define &lt;code&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; as an array though (let's say you want to know when 25%, 50% and 75% of the element is visible) and be able to discern which threshold was triggered in the callback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line &lt;code&gt;16&lt;/code&gt; is quite important as it tells the observer to stop observing, once we have an intersection.  We only need to count a view once the picture first scrolls out of view.  If the user scrolls to the top of the page again, we don't need to count another view.  Once the first view is counted, the observer has done its work and can chill!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important is remembering to use our intersection event.  In line &lt;code&gt;17&lt;/code&gt; we call our &lt;code&gt;handleView&lt;/code&gt; function.  In a real-world application, this would add a new view to our database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-it-out"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  💯 Testing it Out
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can test the component by &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-blog-mdx"&gt;cloning the SvelteKit MDsveX starter&lt;/a&gt;, adding the new component and then adding the component to the rendered content in the BlogPost template.  Let's do that quickly now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Track Page Views in SvelteKit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="how-to-track-page-views-in-svelte-kit-1-1"&gt;Clone the MDsveX blog starter and spin up a local dev server:&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rodneylab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sveltekit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;git sveltekit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;intersection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd sveltekit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;intersection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cp &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;pnpm install # or npm install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;pnpm run dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="how-to-track-page-views-in-svelte-kit-1-2"&gt;Create a new file &lt;code&gt;src/lib/components/IntersectionObserver.svelte&lt;/code&gt; and paste in the code block above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="how-to-track-page-views-in-svelte-kit-1-3"&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;src/lib/components/BlogPost.svelte&lt;/code&gt; component to import the IntersectionObserver component and add it to the DOM:&lt;span&gt;src/lib/components/BlogPost.svelte&lt;/span&gt;jsx&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; readingTime &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'reading-time'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; BannerImage &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'$lib/components/BannerImage.svelte'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="CodeFragment-module--line-number--1xoCV CodeFragment-module--line-number-highlighted--2ykbA"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; IntersectionObserver &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'$lib/components/IntersectionObserver.svelte'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'$lib/components/SEO/index.svelte'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;src/lib/components/BlogPost.svelte&lt;/span&gt;jsx&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="CodeFragment-module--line-number--1xoCV CodeFragment-module--line-number-highlighted--2ykbA"&gt;72&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;73&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;BannerImage &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;imageData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;74&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;heading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="how-to-track-page-views-in-svelte-kit-1-4"&gt;Navigate to a blog post on the dev site and scroll past a picture, an alert should appear.  You can now customise the code, adding a counter to the DOM and hooking up the &lt;code&gt;handleView&lt;/code&gt; function in the Intersection Observer component to your database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-intersection-observer"&gt;full working example on the Rodney Lab GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;.  As well as this I have &lt;a href="https://sveltekit-intersection-observer.rodneylab.com/"&gt;deployed a full working demo&lt;/a&gt;. I hope all the steps above are clear and you know have a working knowledge of the Intersection Observer API and how to use it in SvelteKit.  If there is any way I could improve on this post, please drop a comment below or get in touch.  Also check out the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"&gt;MDN docs on the Intersection Observer API&lt;/a&gt;.  I deliberately explained it a little differently here so that you can use those docs to complement the explanation above.  They have a nice animation which might bring it home, if you are not yet 100% comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>✨Top React Charts Libraries [2021] </title>
      <author>reactjsfav</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 08:36:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pccprint/top-react-charts-libraries-2021-50be</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pccprint/top-react-charts-libraries-2021-50be</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#recharts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://recharts.org/en-US"&gt;Recharts&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recharts is a &lt;strong&gt;Redefined&lt;/strong&gt; chart library built with &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://d3js.org"&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this library is to help you to write charts in React applications without any pain. Main principles of Recharts are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Simply&lt;/strong&gt; deploy with React components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Native&lt;/strong&gt; SVG support, lightweight depending only on some D3 submodules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Declarative&lt;/strong&gt; components, components of charts are purely presentational.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the components of Recharts are clearly separated. The lineChart is composed of x axis, tooltip, grid, and line items, and each of them is an independent React Component. The clear separation and composition of components is one of the principle Recharts follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://airbnb.io/visx"&gt;visx&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;visx is a collection of reusable low-level visualization components. visx combines the power of d3 to generate your visualization with the benefits of react for updating the DOM.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://airbnb.io/visx/gallery"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mlT6CB6r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/airbnb/visx/raw/master/assets/visx-gallery.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more examples using &lt;code&gt;visx&lt;/code&gt;, check out the &lt;a href="https://airbnb.io/visx/gallery"&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nivo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://nivo.rocks/"&gt;nivo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nivo&lt;/strong&gt; provides supercharged React components to easily build dataviz apps, it's built on top of d3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several libraries already exist for React d3 integration, but just a few provide server side rendering ability and fully declarative charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use nivo, you have to install the &lt;code&gt;@nivo/core&lt;/code&gt; package and then choose some of the scoped &lt;code&gt;@nivo&lt;/code&gt; packages according to the charts you wish to use:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add @nivo/core @nivo/bar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Overview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collection of react components to render common data visualization charts, such as &lt;strong&gt;line/area/bar charts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;heat maps&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;scatterplots&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;contour plots&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hexagon heatmaps&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pie and donut charts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sunbursts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;radar charts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;parallel coordinates&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tree maps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notable features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity. &lt;code&gt;react-vis&lt;/code&gt; doesn't require any deep knowledge of data visualization libraries to start building your first visualizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility. &lt;code&gt;react-vis&lt;/code&gt; provides a set of basic building blocks for different charts. For instance, separate X and Y axis components. This provides a high level of control of chart layout for applications that need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of use. The library provides a set of defaults which can be overridden by the custom user's settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with React. &lt;code&gt;react-vis&lt;/code&gt; supports the React's lifecycle and doesn't create unnecessary nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;a href="#hello-netizens-of-hashnodegot-you-some-interesting-stuffs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HELLO NETIZENS OF HASHNODE,GOT YOU SOME INTERESTING STUFFS😊!!!
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5hHvf0ZQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/d8oI97avlJAygnp7RC/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761146a2e976690a1defb30a5e95a0906f5b47fcb23f%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 11 will bring you closer to what you love when the PC plays a more important role in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f1pTKjMl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media3.giphy.com/media/hJaQNVrOPC4Ja/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47v2vqo97os2b647fivujz3fvtapl3rv2wv5wlizqx%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows has long served as a global innovation platform. It's where scrappy companies are named after households, and it's the backbone of global companies. The internet was born and grew up on Windows. Many of us have written our first email, played our first computer game, and coded the first line. Windows is a platform for people to create, connect, learn and achieve – a platform used by more than a billion people today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't take the responsibility of lightly designing so many people. We went from the PC into our lives to try to fit our whole life on the PC for the last 18 months. Our phones were not just for conferences, lectures, and things are done; they were also where we went for games with friends, watch our favorite shows, and perhaps most importantly, interact with each other. We digitally replicated office conversations, hallways, workouts, happy times, and holidays during the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from something useful and useful to something personal and emotional was profound on the PC we saw and felt. This is why we have created the next Windows iteration. To provide you with a familiar environment where you can create, learn, play, and, above all, connect in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is honored and pleased to present you with Windows 11, the operating system that brings you closer to your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have simplified design and user experience to boost your productivity and stimulate your creativity. It is modern, fresh, clever and beautiful. Everything was done to control and bring a sense of peace and ease to every sound, typeface, and icon from the new Start button and Task Bar. We put Start in the center to make finding what you are looking for easier. Start uses the cloud and Microsoft 365 to view your recent files, regardless of the platform or device you used to view them, including Android and iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows has always been about how you can work, with many windows and the ability to snap apps together. Snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops are all new in Windows 11, offering an even more powerful multi-task procedure that stays above what you need to do. These are new tools to help you manage your windows so that you can see exactly what you need in a visually attractive design. You may also build and adjust separate desktops to various aspects of your life, such as work desktops, gaming, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Methods✨
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there are 2 methods to update to windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Update Windows From ISO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update Windows Officially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-windows-from-iso"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update Windows From ISO.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, you have to download the latest Windows ISO from  &lt;a href="https://uupdump.net/"&gt;UUP-DUMP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then&lt;/strong&gt; you have to Download This Bypass File. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/loh5cggo3oh2nm7/Windows11_appraiserres.zip/file"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4RBSHk_5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://img.icons8.com/external-flatart-icons-lineal-color-flatarticons/50/000000/external-download-web-security-flatart-icons-lineal-color-flatarticons.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then After that, Boot Windows 11 ISO with the help of Rufus  &lt;a href="https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.14/rufus-3.14.exe"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extract the Bypass File And &lt;strong&gt;Copy&lt;/strong&gt; Them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goto USB Drive (Where you have booted the windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Booted &lt;strong&gt;USB.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to **Resources **Folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paste&lt;/strong&gt; Files There.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, Install Windows normally :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;NOTE: *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your USB doesn't boot, then copy all your windows files from USB an  past it somewhere on HDD (NOT IN SYSTEM PARTITION), then install from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-from-system-update"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update From System Update.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, the topic of this article "How to Install Windows 11 on Unsupported Devices," but how can we install the update from Windows Update, so actually guys, you can, by Changing some registry files from your pc, the process is pretty simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, You have To Join Windows Insider Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then&lt;/strong&gt;, You have to download this file.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/twqlkskacb7hbhn/win11bypass.zip/file"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4RBSHk_5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://img.icons8.com/external-flatart-icons-lineal-color-flatarticons/50/000000/external-download-web-security-flatart-icons-lineal-color-flatarticons.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.After downloading** Extract** ZIP file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Run &lt;strong&gt;Bypass.reg&lt;/strong&gt; file as an &lt;strong&gt;administrator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   Then Simply Restart your PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Restarting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to** Windows Settings.**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Windows Updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly** Update Windows** From There.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-words"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Words
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were two alternative methods to obtain and install the Windows 11 Insider preview update on an unsupported or incompatible PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do try both of these, and let me know which one works for you in the comments. Also, please continue with caution and be sure you back up any vital data. Feel free to reach out via comments in case of any issues or queries.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  THIS IS AN ARROW FUNCTIONS
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;function called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myfunction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-function-calls-itself"&gt;

  THIS FUNCTION CALLS ITSELF
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inner1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//code&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually a javascript newbie (started a month ago)&lt;br&gt;
So if there's a mistake please tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Better Types using Discriminated Unions in TypeScript</title>
      <author>Maina Wycliffe</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 08:03:07 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-learning/better-types-using-discriminated-unions-in-typescript-4i3g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How we define our types in Typescript impacts how effective typescript is at warning us when we make mistakes. If we take a broad approach i.e. to cover many types in a single type, we end up handicapping typescript and it becomes less effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more specific we are, the more effective typescript can be at catching possible errors. In this article, we are going to look at how we can use discriminative unions to write better and more specific types and help typescript to be more helpful to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take the simplest example I can think of - &lt;strong&gt;Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;. In shapes, we can have Circles, Rectangles, Squares, etc; you get the idea. There is no way you can have a single type alias that can cover all shapes without compromising on something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to define a &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; type alias for just the above 3 shapes, it would need to account for the possibility that all fields are not there for all shapes, i.e. Circle only has a radius, which doesn't exist in either Rectangle or Square, while the circle doesn't have either width or height. As you can imagine, our problem only becomes bigger as you add more shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, our type alias would look like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Circle&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rectangle&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Rectangle&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Square side Length&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this above example, I am assuming that the Square can't take height and width. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the type alias above is not very useful, since if you had a circle, you could easily leave out all fields or add all of them to &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; and typescript will not be able to help you at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially not a good practice for third-party SDKs, where you have to keep referring to the documentation just to get an idea of the shape of the data you are dealing with. Types help us avoid making silly and avoidable mistakes, which we all make as it's in our nature as human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we also lose out on the ability to narrow types. It's not easy to narrow the above type to either Circle, Rectangle, or Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type narrowing is the process of moving a type from a less precise type to a more precise type. You can learn more about type narrowing &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/type-guards-and-narrowing-in-typescript"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#discriminated-unions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Discriminated Unions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discriminated type union is where you use code flow analysis to reduce a set of potential objects down to one specific object. - Typescript &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/discriminate-types"&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let me offer a possible solution to the above problem. We will start by defining three different type-aliases. Each type alias will have a literal type member property - &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt; - distinguishing for its corresponding shape i.e. &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Square&lt;/code&gt; for each of our shapes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Square&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we can use a union of the three to declare a type alias of shape that can only be a single type of the above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Square&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; type alias can only be Square, Rectangle or Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the advantage of the above you may ask? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#strongly-typed-shapes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Strongly Typed Shapes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first advantage is that our types are now strongly typed for each shape as compared to the previous solution. For instance, if you specify the shape to be &lt;strong&gt;Circle&lt;/strong&gt;, then, we only provide radius and if it's missing, Typescript throws an error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error ---&amp;gt; Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'width' does not exist in type 'Circle'.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, once you specify the shape property to be &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt;, then you are restricted to only specifying properties available in the &lt;code&gt;Circle&lt;/code&gt; type alias. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to add fields that do not exist will result in the following error: &lt;code&gt;// Error ---&amp;gt; Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'width' does not exist in type 'Circle'.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-narrowing-is-now-possible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type Narrowing is Now Possible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type narrowing is now possible using the literal property &lt;code&gt;shape&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the type is now a Circle only&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we learned how we can use discriminated unions to write more specific types in Typescript, and thus better types overall and have an improved developer experience. This allows us in turn to write more type-safe code, which can help typescript eliminate a lot of bugs from our code that would otherwise slip through. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Features of ASP.Net Core 3.0 for Web Development</title>
      <author>Tarun Gurang</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:54:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tarungurang/new-features-of-asp-net-core-3-0-for-web-development-1j0c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tarungurang/new-features-of-asp-net-core-3-0-for-web-development-1j0c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;.NET Core 3 was released on 23 September 2019. If you have been using ASP.NET Core for a duration, the major change is that .NET Core 3.0 cannot run on top of the .NET Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET Core 3.0 originates an opt-in feature that permits your app to roll forward to the current major version of .NET Core. Microsoft has introduced that .NET Core in specific is where the revolution will be. There is a plan to coincide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is a free, open-source development environment for developing any genre of application such as web, Android, iOS, cloud, and IoT Applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.Net Core is one of the most preferred platforms in almost many &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/asp-net-cms-web-development-company"&gt;.Net web development companies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; because .Net core is supported by Microsoft as well as the .NET community on GitHub. An updated setting has been attached to control how to roll forward is involved in your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three main features of .NET Core 3.0, chief of Microsoft expressed are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI interoperability and Desktop caseload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud and web app development efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new in .NET Core 3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With comprehensive support from Microsoft, you can now use many of the new features in your production applications. Let’s explore what is new to the platform and take them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.Net Core 3 platform support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It maintains an ample range of Operating System like Windows Server: 2012, Windows Client: 7, 8.1, 10, RHEL: 6+, macOS: 10.12+, Ubuntu: 16.04+, Fedora: 26+, SLES: 12+, Alpine: 3.8+, and openSUSE: 42.3+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/blog/how-to-use-asp-net-core-web-apis-for-web-development"&gt;How To Use Asp.net Core Web Apis For Web Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP.NET Core packaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET Core 3.0 announced that ASP.NET Core is now an SDK, not a set of apparent libraries. In previous versions of ASP.NET Core, you might have gained the different pieces of ASP.NET Core as separate NuGet packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assembly loadability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With it, an application can store and empty gathering with no memory spill. It is another ability of AssemblyLoadContext, which is effortless from an API viewpoint and unwrapped with only a couple of new APIs. It allows releasing all memory for classification types, a loader set to be emptied and get together intrinsically, and static fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASP.NET Core SignalR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a persuading theme but the new endpoint routing modifies how you wire up SignalR as well. In ASP.NET Core 3.0, make sure you are using the Core version of SignalR but this hasn’t replaced much from the 2.2 version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows desktop apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can fabricate windows desktop applications exploiting windows forms and WPF with the .NET Core 3.0. It holds up deploying modern controls and familiar styling from the Windows UI XAML Library (WinUI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layered Compilation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is by default feature in .NET Core 3.0 that authorizes the runtime to all the more adjustable in exploiting the Just-In-Time compiler to represent efficiently better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security in ASP.NET Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security in ASP.NET Core offers other plumbing changes, but this one is slight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET Core 3.0 also has some trivial features including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently added AES-CCM and AES- GCM cyphers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/2 maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 on Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import or Export unsymmetrical keys without any necessity for an X.509 certificate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blazor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blazor is the latest ASP.NET Core related framework that enables us to build interactive client-side web User Interface with .NET. Being a competitive alternative of JavaScript, it uses C# instead of JavaScript for creating UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blazor Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the updates applied for the UI, Blazor dissociates the rendering logic of the component. In an Asp.Net Core app, the Blazor server offers impeccable support for Razor components to get hosted on the server. And through the help of the SignalR connection, the User Interface updates would be efficiently handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JSON serialization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asp.net Core 3.0 no longer relies on JSON.NET to serialize and deserialize JSON Data. There is a new library that has been introduced in System.Text.Json namespace for serializing and deserializing JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C# 8 support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET Core 3.0 has full support for C# 8. C# 8 has lost of performance changes and language improvements. The following are some major changes in C# 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Async streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The supporting features of Range and Index classes make working with arrays much simpler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the usage of Nullable Reference Types, it becomes possible to deal with null related concerns in the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default implementations for functions (methods) would be displayed for Interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To overcome the code indentation related issues, the variable could be scoped by using-declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pattern matching support with returning expression would now be possible through a switch statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/hire-asp-net-core-developer"&gt;Hire ASP.Net Core Developer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? Contact Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduction in memory usages when using the built-in dependency injection container for scoped variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce memory usages for WebSocket connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce memory usage and throughput improvements in form parsing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for HTTP/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HttpClient class has included with the HTTP/2 protocol, a new data communication standard over the web. Compared to its previous, HTTP/2 is less prone to errors and can reduce latency. It also has a smaller network footprint. default protocol in ASP.NET Core 3.0 is HTTP/1.1. if one wants to use HTTP/2 than it has to set manually. Keep in mind both server and client both have support for HTTP/s than only one can use HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gRPC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gRPC is an open-source framework that is developed by the tech giant Google possibly to form distributed systems by connecting the services. Basically, this project is implemented for the purpose of communication between the web services promoting with the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the release of the .NET Core 3.0 framework, the C# applications have to utilize the Grpc.Core library to work with gRPC, a C# wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These given characteristics of gRPC functionality are included in ASP.NET Core 3.0:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grpc.AspNetCore: It is a popular ASP.NET Core framework for that is helpful to host gRPC services. gRPC on ASP.NET Core integrates with standard features of ASP.NET Core such as dependency injection (DI), logging, authorization, and authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grpc.Net.Client: A gRPC client for .NET Core that builds upon the familiar HttpClient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grpc.Net.ClientFactory: gRPC client integration with HttpClientFactory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
