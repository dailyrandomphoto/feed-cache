      <title>How to Bypass Captcha Using Javascript and 2Captcha</title>
      <author>Olubisi Idris Ayinde💡</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 12:55:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/olanetsoft/how-to-bypass-captcha-using-javascript-and-2captcha-57p7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/olanetsoft/how-to-bypass-captcha-using-javascript-and-2captcha-57p7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most unpleasant and ineffective user interface features is CAPTCHA. &lt;br&gt;
CAPTCHA is for a Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart, and these tests have previously reached this level of &lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/inscrutability"&gt;inscrutability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will learn how to bypass captcha using javascript and 2Captcha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-captchas"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are CAPTCHAs?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a website wants to make sure the user isn't a robot, it uses CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart). CAPTCHAs are typically used to prevent spam bots from tampering with content for fraudulent or malicious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular CAPTCHAs we see requires the user to look at a partially obscured image of characters and input the letters they see. In recent years, CAPTCHAS has advanced in sophistication and now incorporates mini-games, picture recognition, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#captchas-downsides"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CAPTCHA's Downsides
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some CAPTCHA types are inaccessible to people who use screen readers or assistive technology to access a website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users find it inconvenient and frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some audiences, it may be challenging to comprehend or use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some CAPTCHA types aren't compatible with all browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-2captcha"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is 2Captcha
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://2captcha.com/"&gt;2Captcha&lt;/a&gt; is a service that recognizes images and CAPTCHAs. The primary goal of 2Captcha is for human employees to solve CAPTCHAs quickly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://2captcha.com?from=12724794"&gt;2Captcha&lt;/a&gt; solves a variety of CAPTCHA styles using essentially the same two API endpoints. The first request sends the data needed to solve the CAPTCHA and returns a request ID (or a base64-ed image in the case of image CAPTCHAs). Once you obtain the request ID, you must send requests to the resulting endpoint, which we will query periodically until the solution is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2captcha-account-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2Captcha Account Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to sign up on &lt;a href="https://2captcha.com?from=12724794"&gt;2Captcha&lt;/a&gt; 's platform to create an API Key for making requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m9xF95lv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632953966239/45i1DDz2b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m9xF95lv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632953966239/45i1DDz2b.png" alt="Register on 2Captcha"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the signup process, we need to pay a token starting at 0.5 USD for 1000 completed CAPTCHAs to request our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As displayed below, we now have access to API Key on our dashboard, which we will use later in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GnkngSnh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632954844875/V_-_4rUmD.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GnkngSnh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632954844875/V_-_4rUmD.png" alt="2Captcha Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-bypass-captcha-on-a-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to bypass CAPTCHA on a website
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, we'll need to set up our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Visual Studio Code by navigating to a directory of your choice on your machine and opening it on the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then execute:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;code.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;code&gt;code .&lt;/code&gt; won't work if you don't have Visual Studio Code installed on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-create-a-directory-and-initialize-raw-npm-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 - Create a directory and initialize &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a directory and initialize npm by typing the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows power shell
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir solve-recaptcha-demo

cd solve-recaptcha-demo

npm init -y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir solve-recaptcha-demo

cd solve-recaptcha-demo

npm init -y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-create-a-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 - Create a file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In step 1, we initialized npm with the command npm init -y, which automatically created a package.json.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create the file using the command below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-install-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 - Install dependencies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll install several dependencies like axios, 2captcha.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i 2captcha axios
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-demo-site"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 - Demo SIte
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll use Discord to see if we can get around the captcha on their signup page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Most websites' terms of service restrict bypassing captchas; this article is solely for educational reasons. Please don't use it for anything malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try inspecting and creating an account on the &lt;a href="https://discord.com/register"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; page so we can get the request payload, fingerprint, captcha key, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request payload after we signed up and were forwarded to the captcha page in the browser's &lt;code&gt;network tab,&lt;/code&gt; which we would be sent from our application, is shown in the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XfjSytlW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632957638390/LzzQvU0H5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XfjSytlW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632957638390/LzzQvU0H5.png" alt="2Captcha request payload"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need a site/captcha key, which will be included in our request body when sending a request from our application. Let's head over to the &lt;code&gt;Response tab&lt;/code&gt; as shown below to copy the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YcpwGcDo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632957868107/YeFvYsEDH.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YcpwGcDo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632957868107/YeFvYsEDH.png" alt="2Captcha key"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-demo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5 - Demo
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We successfully retrieved all the request payload, site key, and fingerprint details in Step 4, so let's head over to our application to register an account and bypass the captcha, which is what we set out to accomplish in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;index.js,&lt;/code&gt; let's create a function with the required data to request 2captcha to bypass captcha on user registration action as shown in the snippet below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const Captcha = require("2captcha");
const axios = require("axios");

// Get access to solver by passing your API key
const captchaSolver = new Captcha.Solver("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");

// Bypass Captcha function
const bypassCaptcha = async () =&amp;gt; {
  console.log("Waiting for response...");

  // Send the captcha solution to the server
  try {
    // Get the captcha image and solve it using 2Captcha
    const { data } = await captchaSolver.hcaptcha(
      "f5561ba9-8f1e-40ca-9b5b-a0b3f719ef34",
      "https://discord.com/register"
    );

    let response = await axios.post(
      "https://discord.com/api/v9/auth/register",
      {
        captcha_key: data,
        consent: true,
        date_of_birth: "1995-06-04",
        email: "testnewmail22@gmail.com",
        fingerprint: "892890553807699989.RrSzl_XX1W9EjtTtvu6v-hIRTww",
        gift_code_sku_id: null,
        invite: null,
        password: "testMail12345",
        promotional_email_opt_in: false,
        username: "testMail12",
      }
    );

    // Print the response
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};

// Run the function
bypassCaptcha();


&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the snippet above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get access to the solver by passing our API key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also get the captcha image and solve it using 2Captcha inside the function created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We send the captcha solution and other data to the server using axios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We then log the response and wait for 2Captcha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run this, type the command below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node index
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Waiting for response...&lt;/code&gt; will be printed on the console almost immediately then we can wait for approximately 5 to 20 secs for the response, which will be similar to what we have below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BJoFimWo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633340941537/u6XUTaDX_.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BJoFimWo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633340941537/u6XUTaDX_.png" alt="2Captcha resolved captcha"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila 🥳 We successfully bypassed the captcha during the registration, and now we have a token to log in, as shown above. Let us proceed to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-6-login"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6 - Login
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll use the token we got after bypassing the captcha to log in, which we can do directly from the console by pasting the snippet below into the console and executing the &lt;code&gt;login&lt;/code&gt; method, which will redirect us when necessary.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function login(token) {
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; {
    document.body.appendChild(
      document.createElement`iframe`
    ).contentWindow.localStorage.token = `"${token}"`;
  }, 50);
  setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
    location.reload();
  }, 2500);
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will execute the login method in the console using the snippet below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;login("TOKEN_HERE")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After pasting the snippet above, we should end up with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tuzCi4PD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633342286853/ZS7kZpz8H.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tuzCi4PD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633342286853/ZS7kZpz8H.png" alt="Login Token"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final result is displayed below, in which we are redirected to validate/verify our phone number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MrYs1D5E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633342430105/gJrHSkOsY.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MrYs1D5E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633342430105/gJrHSkOsY.png" alt="captcha bypassed"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Robotics Influence In Health-Care🧬</title>
      <author>KrishnaBMU</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/krishnabmu/robotics-influence-in-health-care-4mne</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dSfFWIBU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4drupbc1mrsl5oza27g0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dSfFWIBU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4drupbc1mrsl5oza27g0.png" alt="Animated robot and medicine box"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food delivery&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Surgeries&lt;/strong&gt;, robotics are used everywhere. It is so common in everyday life, that it is very intuitive to notice them. They are the frontiers in reducing the work on humans and making us productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#health-care"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Health Care🏥
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors rely a lot on robotics from uploading the &lt;em&gt;prescription&lt;/em&gt; to performing complex &lt;em&gt;spinal cord surgery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It has vastly decreased the human error in heath care industries. Robotics have become so important in health care that people say they can completely replace physicians, but that may be highly unlikely. Now let's talk in specific about the different healthcare robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#surgical-robots"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Surgical Robots
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently robots only perform minor surgeries like "Minimally invasive procedures" and "surgical procedures" but the cap for its total potential is not completely opened, full surgery robots are still in experimentation stage. They are yet to be field tested. Common examples where we use these are for Heart Stent, Mitral valve repair, Coronary artery bypass yeah yeah I know fancy names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LPpeGNXa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian-Hernandez-10/publication/280494916/figure/fig1/AS:614181690691598%401523443734606/Example-of-Exoskeleton-where-actuators-are-placed-close-to-the-joints.png%3Fsize%3D200" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LPpeGNXa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian-Hernandez-10/publication/280494916/figure/fig1/AS:614181690691598%401523443734606/Example-of-Exoskeleton-where-actuators-are-placed-close-to-the-joints.png%3Fsize%3D200" alt="Exoskeleton picture"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exoskeletons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exoskeletons🦾
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wow this is an interesting topic, They are support structures for our body. In healthcare they are used when motor ability of human body is affected. &lt;br&gt;
For suppose when someone gets their hand fractured or loose their control over their body, sensors can be placed to get their neural input from brain and control a &lt;em&gt;assistive limb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
They are recently being used in military to increase the efficiency of a soldier in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#general"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  General🧬
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applications of robotics are a lot in health care they can be used to deliver medicines, monitor patients, handle sensitive materials and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#story-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Story Time🎶
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an experience that I had in my family, My sister who is in her 20s drove into a pothole which led to the breakage of her collar bone🦴. We had a hard time finding the right procedure to get her bone back to normal, After many scans and inspections we had to make her go through a surgery, We though the surgery would leave a mark on her shoulder but thanks to the advancement in healthcare with robotics all the procedures and the surgery went well, she recovered shortly.&lt;br&gt;
Now let us think, what are the different places, robotics are involved, oh boy oh boy I was surprised to see almost all the parts from scanning to the surgery depend on them some or the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEO Tips &amp; Tricks for Single Page Website</title>
      <author>kennyloris109</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 12:28:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shahbazkhan/seo-tips-tricks-for-single-page-website-1fkf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shahbazkhan/seo-tips-tricks-for-single-page-website-1fkf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Single-page websites -- also known as one-page websites -- have become quite popular lately. Instead of causing clutter, you simplify everything on your Home page. A visitor can get an idea of what your website is about, where to go for a certain action, and can easily navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a downside of such websites. The loading speed of such pages is slower than the traditional multi-page websites, and creating a keyword strategy for these is also a challenge. Optimizing such websites is always a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s first understand what a single-page website is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-a-singlepage-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What’s a Single-Page Website?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single-page website is a compressed website compared to the traditional ones, as all the content of a page is compiled in one page. Such websites feature single scroll navigation, you scroll down to the bottom until you have understood what the website is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a user, such websites are time-saving. They don’t have to navigate from one page to another and they get their answer without navigating from one page to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can You Optimize a Single Page Website for SEO?&lt;br&gt;
Here are some proven tips and tricks to optimize a single-page website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1write-descriptive-titles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.Write Descriptive Titles
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since single-page websites don’t have much content, you don’t have much to play with when it comes to incorporating keywords into your content. But still, you get some opportunities to optimize your website for particular keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your website’s title is the first place to use your primary keywords. A descriptive title will tell both Google and the visitors what your website is about and what it offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But make sure your website’s title is original and attractive. Don’t end up writing a complete phrase or copying your competitor’s title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2write-meta-descriptions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2.Write Meta Descriptions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be an SEO expert if you underestimate the importance of a catchy, keyword-optimized meta description. This description is a snippet that appears on the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of content usually tells the searcher what the content contains. But make sure the description is specific and relevant. Avoid keyword stuffing because nobody clicks on such pages whose description doesn’t even make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3optimize-your-page-speed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3.Optimize Your Page Speed
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said before, one-page websites have a slower loading speed. And this slow loading speed ultimately affects the user experience and ranking of your website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, you can optimize your page speed. If you have a WordPress website, you can use plugins for this purpose. And you can find numerous articles online to resolve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4create-fresh-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4.Create Fresh Content
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t have just a single page, you know you have very little space to cover your keywords and create content. And when all your competitors have multi-page websites, beating them in the organic search results becomes challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by creating fresh content on a regular basis you can beat them. Fresh and dynamic content keeps you afloat. Therefore, you must rewrite content for different sections of the page. Keep enriching the page with fresh copy and observe the results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional SEO, this approach is rarely followed but for a single page website writing content every now and then can boost your website’s visibility on search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5include-keywords-in-headings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5.Include Keywords in Headings
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google understands what your website is about from your content. And by including your main keywords in the headings, you can make it further easier for Google to understand and rank your content for relevant queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, you have only a single page to tell Google. So make sure you add keywords in all the headings on your page. But once again, those keywords should look natural and readable. Keyword stuffing should be avoided at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6build-authority"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6.Build Authority
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter whether you have a single-page app or a multi-page website, you can only climb the ladder by building authority. The more authority you build in the eyes of Google, the higher Google will rank you in your niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To optimize a single-page website, link building plays an important role. Since you are not spending to create bulk content for multiple pages, you can utilize the same resources for building high-quality links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be done through buying high-quality links or approaching those sites that have linked to your competitors. Besides that, include social media buttons to the website so content can be shared easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7patience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7.Patience!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you heard it right. Patience is the key when you are working on a single-page website because it’s much more challenging than a multi-page one. &lt;br&gt;
Use analytics to track your users, their behavior, and what they like more on your site. Gather data and tweak your SEO strategy accordingly. If a multi-page site is taking 3 months to show results, a single-page site might take 5-6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to do If You are Unable to Rank Your Single-Page Website?&lt;br&gt;
If you have a single-page website for your business and you are struggling to drive traffic to it, hire an expert &lt;a href="https://www.digitalexpress.agency/SEO"&gt;SEO Agency&lt;/a&gt; to optimize it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEO demands time and focus, and if you devote your full attention to SEO you won’t be able to focus on the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use the VoiceOver Screen Reader</title>
      <author>Tyler Hawkins</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 12:26:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thawkin3/how-to-use-the-voiceover-screen-reader-5bo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thawkin3/how-to-use-the-voiceover-screen-reader-5bo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a frontend software engineer building web applications, accessibility is an essential component to keep in mind. While there are many automated tools out there that can help you in your accessibility efforts, none of these are adequate replacements for simple manual testing with a keyboard and with a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, frontend engineers need to learn how to use a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screen readers are assistive technology that help blind or low-vision users to navigate their computers. VoiceOver is a screen reader that ships with the operating system on every Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with screen readers, learning how to use one can feel like a daunting task. But, it’s actually not that hard to get started! By learning just a few simple commands, you can be navigating your web app in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we’ll go over some of the most common VoiceOver commands to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#voiceover-keyboard-shortcuts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  VoiceOver Keyboard Shortcuts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the keyboard shortcuts you would normally use when navigating a web page using VoiceOver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Command + F5&lt;/code&gt; - Start or stop VoiceOver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Right/Left Arrows&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next/previous item on the page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Shift + Up/Down Arrows&lt;/code&gt; - Drill up/down on an element&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Space&lt;/code&gt; - Click or interact with an element&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Command + H&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next heading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Command + L&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next link&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Command + X&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Command + G&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Command + J&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next form field (buttons, checkboxes, comboboxes, radio buttons, text inputs, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate to the next focusable element&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt; - Stop VoiceOver from reading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Control + Option + U&lt;/code&gt; - Open the web rotor for quick access to various page content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go backwards with many of these commands, you can hold &lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt; while pressing the keys.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! During 90% of my navigation with a screen reader, I find myself using just a few of the commands listed above. I’ll turn on VoiceOver with &lt;code&gt;Command + F5&lt;/code&gt;, navigate through the page using &lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Right/Left Arrows&lt;/code&gt;, and interact with clickable content using &lt;code&gt;Control + Option + Space&lt;/code&gt;. Just about every other command on that list is just bonus content to help you skip around the page even more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a complete list of VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts, feel free to check out either of these two wonderful guides created by &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/"&gt;WebAIM&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href="https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/voiceover-keyboard-shortcuts"&gt;Deque&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, and thanks for being an accessibility advocate!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vizzu: Open source library for animated data visualizations and data stories</title>
      <author>Simon László</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 12:16:40 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/simzer/vizzu-open-source-library-for-animated-data-visualizations-and-data-stories-1d4i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, dev.to community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four years of coding and navigating the rough waters of bootstrapping a startup and finding the right path forward, our small team of Vizzu is at the best place it can be: We finally have our first product: an open-source library. (I admit, I might be biased here as an open-source enthusiast developer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to announce that we are releasing Vizzu’s first public beta (v0.3.1) into the world, and I’d like to say a few words about why we think it is unique among the dataviz libraries and why we hope that you will love to use it as much as we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About the project:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vizzu is a free, open-source Javascript/C++ library utilizing a generic dataviz engine that generates many types of charts and seamlessly animates between them. It is designed for building animated data stories and interactive explorers as Vizzu enables showing different perspectives of the data that the viewers can easily follow due to the animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zraAM9UP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://lib.vizzuhq.com/mediakit/banner/infinite_chart_small.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zraAM9UP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://lib.vizzuhq.com/mediakit/banner/infinite_chart_small.gif" alt="Vizzu"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the project, please visit our: &lt;br&gt;
Project page on GitHub: &lt;a href="https://github.com/vizzuhq/vizzu-lib"&gt;https://github.com/vizzuhq/vizzu-lib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tutorial: &lt;a href="https://lib.vizzuhq.com/0.3.0/"&gt;https://lib.vizzuhq.com/0.3.0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Examples: &lt;a href="https://lib.vizzuhq.com/0.3.0/#examples-1.1"&gt;https://lib.vizzuhq.com/0.3.0/#examples-1.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a little taste of the API, here is a small snippet from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/vizzuhq/vizzu-lib/blob/main/README.md"&gt;readme&lt;/a&gt;. After you set your data of three data series named ‘Foo’, ‘Bar’, ‘Baz’, creating a bar chart is as simple as this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;chart.animate({
  x: 'Foo',
  y: 'Bar'
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can transform it into a scatter plot by changing the data series governing different aspects of the chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;chart.animate({
  color: 'Foo',
  x: 'Baz', 
  geometry: 'circle' 
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2nbHOQcf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://vizzuhq.github.io/vizzu-lib-doc/readme/example.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2nbHOQcf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://vizzuhq.github.io/vizzu-lib-doc/readme/example.gif" alt="Example chart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-is-so-special-about-vizzu"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what is so special about Vizzu?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you built animated data visualizations in the past, you had a big decision to make: You could go for a low-level library, most likely D3, which you could use to create stunning, highly customized animated dataviz, for the price of putting a lot of code and effort into your project. Or you could choose one of the high-level charting libraries, create static charts with considerably less code, and then animate a growing number (pun intended) of aspects of your chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-level charting libraries are easier to use, because they implement the rules of data visualization (axes, legends, etc) and provide a high-level interface over this ruleset. Sometimes with a separate interface for each chart type, other times using the abstract interface of the 'Grammar of Graphics', like the Vega library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out to build a dataviz tool, which offers you a third path. We think that the missing link for making animation a first-class citizen is to extend the data visualization ruleset into the time dimension, by working towards the Grammar of Animation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first step, we created our engine that is inspired by the Grammar of Graphics, and provides a common interface for several different chart types. Then we looked at the parameter space of this engine and made each parameter interpolatable, turning our engine into a generic chart morpher, which can continuously interpolate between any chart types that can be described on its interface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step on this road was to analyze these transitions and come up with rules that make them self-explanatory and easy to follow for the viewers.  Finally, we built these rules into our engine to guide you through the mostly uncharted sea of dataviz animations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have a lot to do, but we believe we are at a big milestone, as now we can give you a tool you can use to build highly animated data visualizations easily. Check out the examples and the tutorial, and decide for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about our results on the path towards the Grammar of Animation, check out Peter's talk later this week at Crunch conf: &lt;a href="https://crunchconf.com/speaker/P%C3%A9terVidzi"&gt;https://crunchconf.com/speaker/P%C3%A9terVidzi&lt;/a&gt; and follow us on Twitter: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/VizzuHQ"&gt;http://twitter.com/VizzuHQ&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting salary expectations with cousin Izzy</title>
      <author>rinaarts</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:59:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rinaarts/setting-salary-expectations-with-cousin-izzy-3mdf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rinaarts/setting-salary-expectations-with-cousin-izzy-3mdf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So… you're looking for a job and you get a call from a recruiter. The conversation is going well and they'd like to move you into the technical interviews stage. Or maybe, you've already completed all the technical part and they want to prepare the job offer. And then they ask the dreaded question: What are your salary expectations? And you freeze. Or, at least - I freeze. I'm no good at this part… I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I know what I'm worth - but what if I have it all wrong? Or what if they can pay more than I expect? Or they can't afford what I'm asking for and they won't want to continue with the interview process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cousin-izzy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cousin Izzy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a family story about our savvy-salesperson cousin Izzy who (legend has it) used to offer the following sales advice: Imagine you're selling two birds in a cage. A buyer comes in to your shop and asks "how much?". &lt;br&gt;
You answer: "$50". &lt;br&gt;
If they blink, you sell for that price. If they don't - you say "for the cage". &lt;br&gt;
They ask: "How much for the birds?", you answer: "$20". &lt;br&gt;
If they blink - sell for that price. If they don't - say "each".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: It's quite possible none of this story is true, but that's how I heard it and now it's mine to tell as I please.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-this-translate-into-salary-expectations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does this translate into salary expectations?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I do my research. I know how much I make now and how much of an upgrade I expect. I ask friends and use my network, check salary surveys, ask in suitable forums etc. Once I understand what the expected salary range for me should be, I want to maximize how much I can get within that range. That's where cousin Izzy comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say I've determined I should be paid X. When I'm asked what my salary expectations are, I say: "I don't know what your compensation package includes, but I was thinking of X".&lt;br&gt;
If they "blink", I stop there. If they don't blink - I continue saying: "base salary, of course. On top of that I expect there will be a signing bonus and equity".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use their reactions as a signal if I can ask for more at this point or not. From my experience, salary ranges can vary extensively between different companies and I've had times when I say X and they'll blink metaphorically by saying something like "we can probably get to that with equity and other benefits". If they react along those lines - I know there's not much point asking for more at this stage, while other recruiters will ask "base salary?" which tells me I can push for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've anchored your salary expectations and the highest place you can, you can and should negotiate the offer you get, but that's out of scope and there are many other excellent articles on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frequently-asked-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frequently asked questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#isnt-that-greedy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Isn't that greedy?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no greedy in salary. This is a business relationship. Would you work for free? I hope not. Your time and expertise is worth something to the company, or they wouldn't hire you. You're just trying to figure out how much it's worth, and this is never a level playing field. They'll always know more about the market, how much they're willing to pay, how much other people at the same level are being paid… Remove greedy from your vocabulary (for this interaction at least).&lt;br&gt;
In fact, from my experience as a woman, who's gotten some backlash for trying to negotiate - what I like about this method is it's easy and gradual, and doesn't require you to be especially brave or savvy, or have much of a poker face (none of which I'm very good at). You're just softly reacting to the conversation and what's happening in it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-what-if-they-rescind-the-offer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But what if they rescind the offer?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decent places won't do that. They'll tell you what they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pay and try to reach agreement. However, not all places are decent and even of the decent ones - they may think it's not worth anyone's time to continue the process if the expectations are way off. This can happen. I'm not saying this is not a risk. In fact, it happened to me the last two times I was looking for a job. I was (and am) privileged to have been working while looking for a job - so this didn't worry me much. If they didn't want to pay what I was asking, that was fine. I didn't have to work for them. If you're in that position - that's the attitude you should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other folk are not in this position - whether it's their first job or because they're acutely suffering at their current job. And I totally get that. In that case you can just aim at getting an offer. Don't try to maximize anything. If you can get two offers - that's usually a good time to try to negotiate (this is always true). If not, take the offer you got - but don't get too comfortable, after a year or so, try looking around to see what you're worth, maybe you're being underpaid and you should ask for a raise. Maybe you can look for another job from a better starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option, if you can afford it, is to try maximizing the offer &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt;. If they rescind, you can try again at another company. And again at another. It's unlikely all of them will rescind, and if they do - that may be a sign you are asking for too much. In that case you should lower your expectations. You can even go back to some of those other companies and say "Hey! I really liked your product/culture/whatever, can we try again?". They might say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shouldnt-you-try-and-make-them-tell-you-what-the-salary-range-is"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Shouldn't you try and make them tell you what the salary range is?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you absolutely should. But quite often, they will not share this information. And, as I said before, it's not a level playing field - it's good to have some tools in your toolbox for the case where you don't have this information and can't get it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this far! I hope it was helpful. And if it wasn't - well, at least remember to blink if you ever happen to want to buy a pair of birds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use Lettering in UI/UX Design</title>
      <author>UI/UX Design Services </author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:57:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reloadux/how-to-use-lettering-in-ui-ux-design-1fg6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reloadux/how-to-use-lettering-in-ui-ux-design-1fg6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In simple words, lettering is that the art of drawing letters. Using this system, you'll create unique inscriptions on paper, blackboard, wall, or a display screen in any graphic editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional &lt;a href="https://reloadux.com/ux-services"&gt;UI/UX design agencies&lt;/a&gt; like Tkxel in Poland use lettering for &lt;a href="https://tkxel.com/mobile-app-development-services/"&gt;mobile and web design&lt;/a&gt;. This post will discuss lettering in additional detail and see what possibilities it provides to web designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it equal to calligraphy thing as lettering?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In calligraphy, letters are written with a pen, brush, or marker. The form of the letters in calligraphy depends on the writing instrument's size and shape, tilt, and therefore the pressure on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lettering isn't writing but a literal drawing of letters. To try to do this, you'll take a pencil with a ruler, draw the specified shape on paper, and shade it with a marker. Or do an equivalent thing during a vector editor employing a graphics tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calligraphy may be a more complex art. What must draw an excellent and delightful inscription during a single touch, otherwise you need to start over. When doing lettering, the letter's shape is often corrected repeatedly, measured with a ruler, painted over, and altered as constantly as you wish. It doesn't need such subtle skills as calligraphy so that any designer can try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the difference between fonts and lettering?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready-made fonts are often wont to type any text, but the proportions of the letters, style, and spacing remain unchanged. On the other hand, with lettering, unique letters are created for a selected inscription. Therefore, you would like lettering if you would like to form them of various sizes, thicknesses, or with another inclination for esthetical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of lettering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lettering is of great use if you would like to form people to concentrate on the message. It allows you to style the text and make it more visible. For instance, it's unlikely that it'll be possible to arrange the text during a cat shape from words using conventional ready-made fonts. However, with lettering, it's no problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The letters are often almost of any shape and sort. It's essential that they were within the same style and obeyed a standard logic. A minimum of in one word, the letters are drawn within the same type. If the caption is long, different graphics are often used for other dishes. But there must be something in common within the whole composition. For instance, they often attempt to maintain uniform proportions of letters – the ratio of their width and height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where is lettering used now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite often, different inscriptions are created for corporate identity. For instance, lettering is employed within the Coca-Cola and Disney logos. Competitors may take an equivalent font if you write the company's name during a publicly available font tomorrow. With lettering, the inscription is going to be the one and only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lettering isn't only a recognition tool. Sometimes it's simply a matter of beauty. Postcards and souvenirs, websites, and apps are decorated with hand-drawn letters because it's fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://reloadux.com"&gt;UI/UX design&lt;/a&gt;, lettering is often wont to add a special touch to digital projects. It's helpful to form a selected message to stand out, create an environment, or embellish the page. Lettering allows designers to play with the text and organize it in several forms with almost no limitations. Moreover, every lettering sample is exclusive and can not be stolen by competitors.&lt;br&gt;
All in all, if you're performing on a project where a unique atmosphere and wonder are essential, lettering is your ally.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multiple Classes in Material UI or MUI</title>
      <author>Rohit Nishad</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:55:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rohitnishad613/multiple-classes-in-material-ui-or-mui-3ee6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rohitnishad613/multiple-classes-in-material-ui-or-mui-3ee6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can either use a proper String concatenation or if your needs are wide and highly used then I recommend adding a package for this purpose. In this post, we talk about Multiple classes in Material UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s add Multiple classes in Material UI with or without usestyles, withstyles, makestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-1-concat-classes-properly-in-classname-property"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method #1: Concat classes properly in className property
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can concat your classes with backticks&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const classes = usestyles()
className={`${classes.container} ${classes.spacious}`}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more info and credit &lt;a href="https://360techexplorer.com/material-ui-multiple-classes/"&gt;read this blog post from 360TechExplorer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up Eslint(airbnb configuration), Prettier and Husky pre-commit hooks in CRA </title>
      <author>Ankit Tiwari</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:51:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ankitt8/setting-up-eslint-airbnb-configuration-prettier-and-husky-pre-commit-hooks-in-cra-5dbo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ankitt8/setting-up-eslint-airbnb-configuration-prettier-and-husky-pre-commit-hooks-in-cra-5dbo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Talk is cheap, lets directly get into how to get setting up eslint, prettier and husky pre-commit hook DONE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-install-eslint-as-dev-dependency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Install eslint as dev dependency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install eslint --save-dev&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if using yarn &lt;code&gt;yarn add eslint --dev&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-setup-eslint-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Setup eslint configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx eslint --init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if using yarn &lt;code&gt;yarn run eslint --init&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;above will ask for few configurations I had selected for my purpose below configuration

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eslint to check syntax and find problems, project react, project uses typescript yes, typeof module JavaScript, format of configuration .json.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b_1mTz-s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c3u17omxfjxsozjlnw1x.png" alt="ESLint configuration"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-install-airbnb-style-guide"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Install airbnb style guide
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install eslint-config-airbnb —-save-dev&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn add eslint-config-airbnb --dev&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if copying above command doesn't work type the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-edit-raw-eslintrcjson-endraw-file-created-in-step-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Edit &lt;code&gt;.eslintrc.json&lt;/code&gt; file created in &lt;em&gt;step 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add inside &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; rule &lt;code&gt;"airbnb"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my current extends rule inside .eslintrc.json
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"extends"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"eslint:recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"plugin:react/recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"airbnb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-lets-test-if-everything-is-working-fine-till-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Lets test if everything is working fine till now
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a &lt;code&gt;test.js (or .ts, .jsx, .tsx)&lt;/code&gt; file &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write some code which is against the airbnb style guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then run command &lt;code&gt;./node_moduels/.bin/eslint test.js&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it should throw eslint erros with specific rules
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IL5vaA-k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3tjkt8giisw9iy76sonf.png" alt="Linting Errors"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are getting above linting errors implies your eslint set up is correct till now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-set-up-raw-prettier-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Set up &lt;code&gt;prettier&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install prettier --save-dev&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn add prettier --dev&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;since prettier and eslint have their own set of formatting rules to avoid conflicts lets install plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install eslint-config-prettier --save-dev&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn add eslint-config-prettier --dev&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted prettier to be run as eslint rule to do that add another plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn add eslint-plugin-prettier --dev&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now add above plugins in &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; rule of &lt;code&gt;.eslintrc.json&lt;/code&gt; i.e eslint configuration file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add to the existing rule of extends : &lt;code&gt;"plugin:prettier/recommended"&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; is
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"extends"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"eslint:recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"plugin:react/recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"airbnb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"plugin:prettier/recommended"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier"&gt;eslint-config-prettier&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier"&gt;eslint-plugin-prettier&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-now-lets-again-run-the-testjs-file-using-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Now lets again run the test.js file using command
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./node_modules/.bin/eslint test.js&lt;/code&gt; prettier errors should also be reported ideally
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wEVxec7N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrqcv8o8c8dr69zxebrc.png" alt="Formatting errors are overridden by Prettier"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the difference between this image and image at step 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-vs-code-eslint-extenstion-to-rescue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. VS Code eslint extenstion to rescue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unrealistic to run this command on every file we will be coding manually , here comes the VS code &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"&gt;eslint extension&lt;/a&gt; to rescue, once restart after installing it, now as you code it will highlight the linting errors hurreeyy 
e.g
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DCyVpAbg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e7w8bdfftgjrr87q0kms.png" alt="VSCode eslint extension"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-now-i-want-scripts-which-will-lint-and-format-the-changes-done-by-me-in-a-commit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Now I wan't scripts (which will lint and format the changes done by me in a commit)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lets first include the scripts then we will come to husky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include below scripts inside &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"_lint"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"eslint --config ./.eslintrc.json --ext js --ext jsx --ext tsx --ext ts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"lint"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run _lint -- ./src/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"lint:fix"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run _lint -- --fix ./src/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"format"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"prettier --write './**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss,md,json}' --config ./.prettierrc"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40271230/how-to-run-eslint-fix-from-npm-script/58954298#comment117386806_58954298"&gt;reason why -- is added&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;you can create &lt;code&gt;.prettierrc&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;sample &lt;code&gt;.prettierrc&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"trailingComma"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"none"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"semi"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"quoteProps"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"as-needed"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"overrides"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"*.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"options"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"parser"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"files"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"*.scss"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"options"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"parser"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"scss"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html"&gt;prettier options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-now-lets-integrate-lintig-to-be-run-on-all-staged-files-included-in-a-commit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Now lets integrate lintig to be run on all staged files included in a commit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;here comes to rescue &lt;a href="https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged"&gt;lint-staged&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-i-know-its-a-lot-one-more-final-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11. I know its a lot, one more final step
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as official docs say only command is enough to set up and here it is &lt;code&gt;npx mrm@2 lint-staged&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this command will install and configure &lt;a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky"&gt;husky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged"&gt;lint-staged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;now add change lint-staged configuration in package.json
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"lint-staged"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"prettier --write"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"eslint --config ./.eslintrc.json --ext js --ext ts --ext jsx --ext tsx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what this does is what ever .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx files are preset in src directory in a commit are first formatted using prettier then they are linted using eslint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8a-u5idQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/832ahgffinb9w4d3y25y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8a-u5idQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/832ahgffinb9w4d3y25y.png" alt="DEMO"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as you can see prettier formatted the code and added in staging, and eslint showed errors hence commit was not successful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Ahh finally we are done, now you can start your development server &lt;code&gt;npm run start&lt;/code&gt; *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure you got some errors if(there would have been any eslint erros in your code base src directory), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whats happening is react-scripts doesn't start the server if there are any eslint errors &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me how to avoid it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;ESLINT_NO_DEV_ERRORS='true'&lt;/code&gt; just before &lt;code&gt;react-scripts start&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you are good to do development, hope everything goes well while doing deployment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its not so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you do &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt; again &lt;code&gt;react-scripts build&lt;/code&gt; doesn't build if there are any eslint errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN='true'&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;code&gt;react-scripts build&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now yes nothing else is remaining, &lt;br&gt;
I always wanted to set up eslint, prettier husky pre-commit hook from the day I had seen this cool stuff, had ready various blogs docs, were not able to setup it properly, finally this weekend I did it, hurrreyyy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-code-quality-easier-pr-reviews-across-team"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better Code Quality, easier PR reviews across team.
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Fixing the Host Header vulnerability with Nginx</title>
      <author>Shalvah</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 11:18:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shalvah/fixing-the-host-header-vulnerability-with-nginx-2237</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shalvah/fixing-the-host-header-vulnerability-with-nginx-2237</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I was investigating an error report from Sentry on &lt;a href="http://usetentacle.app"&gt;Tentacle&lt;/a&gt;. I noticed something baffling: the URL wasn't mine. The error was definitely from my site, but the URL it happened on was not mine. After wondering if someone had managed to deploy my private code elsewhere, I eventually realized I was looking at a case of &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting"&gt;Host header injection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#investigation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Investigation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A HTTP 1.1 request consists of a line containing the requested path and method, followed by zero or more lines of headers, something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight http"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;/path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;somedomain.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This request is sent to a server. But one server can host multiple sites, so the Host header is often used to determine which site to route the request too. In your app, it might feel like the host is something from your server, something you can trust. But it isn't! It's user input (like all HTTP headers), so it makes sense that it can be an attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Host header injection attack, the attacker tries to make your site think it's running on a different domain, which opens up several possibilities. For instance, if your site generates password reset links using the current domain, an attacker could trick you into generating links pointing to their site. Then when a user clicks on one of those, they're taken to the attacker's site instead. The attacker can then retrieve the reset token and use it on your site to change the user's password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confirm, I tried to replicate the injection request. There are different ways of trying this; the simplest way is to set a different Host header from the URL you're requesting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://mydomain.com &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Host: someotherdomain.com'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It didn't work at first. My site is behind CloudFlare, which adequately protects against this kind of thing, so it returned an error. But then I switched the request URL to my server's public IP, and it worked, unfortunately. My site, &lt;code&gt;mydomain.com&lt;/code&gt;, had loaded, but the request logs were showing the Host as &lt;code&gt;someotherdomain.com&lt;/code&gt;. Welp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resolution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resolution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I had confirmed that it worked. Now to find a fix. The first step was to cut it off at the source: my site sits behind an Nginx server, so I could configure it to reject requests like this. It was surprisingly difficult to find information on this. After some tests, I was able to come up with this as my Nginx configuration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight nginx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;default_server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mydomain.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;!~*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;^(mydomain.com|www.mydomain.com)&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="s"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$http_host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;!~*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;^(mydomain.com|www.mydomain.com)&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="s"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Other stuff...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;\.php$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Other PHP FastCGI configs...&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="kn"&gt;fastcgi_param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;HTTP_HOST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$http_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are two main parts to the fix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements check if the host matches one of my expected domains; if not, they kill the request &lt;a href="https://httpstatuses.com/444"&gt;with a 444&lt;/a&gt;. I added two checks because the &lt;code&gt;$http_host&lt;/code&gt; (Host header) and &lt;code&gt;$host&lt;/code&gt; (the Nginx server name) &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67226842/7370522"&gt;may differ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fastcgi_param&lt;/code&gt; directive sets the value of the &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header that is passed to PHP. This was necessary because I noticed that if I made a raw request like this (two Host headers):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight http"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mydomain.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;someotherdomain.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;the earlier host checks would pass (because of the first Host header), but the second Host header would be passed to my app. I'm not sure why that happens, but adding the FastCGI directive ensures that the Host header seen by Nginx is the same one seen by PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably more direct ways to configure Nginx for this, but this was the best I could come up with.😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#assessment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Assessment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it was unlikely the attacker had been able to achieve any damage with this, and manual checks confirmed this. My app doesn't use the Host header for anything or output it anywhere. And mature web frameworks like Laravel don't rely on the Host header. Laravel requires you to set an &lt;code&gt;APP_URL&lt;/code&gt; environment variable, which is what it uses for URL generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not new to bots trying exploits—even before I launched Tentacle, I've been seeing requests to /wp-admin and friends. My strategy for dealing with these is to use tools that are secure by default, backed up with automated security scans, and manual reviews. I didn't know about this vulnerability before I encountered this, but this was a good reminder to never trust user input, and use tools that take security seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#appendix"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Appendix
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in reading more about this vulnerability, here are a few links:

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.skeletonscribe.net/2013/05/practical-http-host-header-attacks.html"&gt;Old examples in some web frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting"&gt;In-depth look in 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to test this in-depth, you'll probably need to send a raw HTTP request, as many request libraries (including curl) limit the weird things you can do (like duplicate headers). A readily available option on Linux is netcat. Create a file containing the request:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight http"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;yourdomain.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;someotherdomain.com&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;then pipe that to a netcat session to your server's IP:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat &lt;/span&gt;raw.http | nc 144.45.71.8 80
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Design Patterns : Creational Patterns</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creational-patterns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creational Patterns
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Provide object creation mechanism"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creational Design Patterns are concerned with the way in which objects are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-we-need-creational-patterns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do we need Creational Patterns?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creational Design Patterns&lt;/strong&gt; address this issue by &lt;em&gt;decoupling&lt;/em&gt; the client entirely from the actual initialization process. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Difficult to understand right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, sometimes its important to be &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; with the nature of your object. When its required that the nature of the object must be changed according to the nature of the program. In such cases, creational design patterns come in handy to provide more general and flexible approach to object creation.&lt;br&gt;
In other words, the general way of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design and to prevent this we use Creational Design Patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-use-creational-design-patterns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to use Creational design Patterns?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well if your aim resonates with any of the below scenario,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want at most only one instance of an object available throughout the application. eg. Service classes should be stateless, and hence they don't need more than one instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to create objects of several related different classes and you do not want to specify which object is created and also you do not want to coupled your code to use one class so that if later you introduce another class, this would require to make change in the entire codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More such scenarios exist however the intake should be that if you want your code less coupled in terms on initialization and reduce complexities and instability by creating objects in a controlled manner, maybe creational pattern can come to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-different-creational-design-patterns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the different Creational design Patterns?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be discussing about 5 of the commonly used Creational design Patterns namely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singleton Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factory Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract Factory Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Builder Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be discussing about above mentioned patterns in the upcoming posts starting with Singleton Pattern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note - Be part of the discussion and also leave a heart if you found it helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
