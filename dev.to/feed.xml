      <title>#2 CSS PROPERTY - BACKGROUND ATTACHMENT</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/pawanbhayde/2-css-property-background-attachment-pic</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value:&lt;/strong&gt; scroll | fixed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial:&lt;/strong&gt; scroll&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applies to:&lt;/strong&gt; all elements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inherited:&lt;/strong&gt; no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage values:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a background image is specified, the CSS property "background-attachment" determines if the image is in a fixed position in relation to the screen or if it scrolls with the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body{
background-color: red;
background-image: url(image.gif);
background-repeat: repeat-y;
background-attachment: fixed;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSS1 core: UAs may treat "fixed" as "scroll". However, it is recommended they interpret "fixed" correctly, at least on the "HTML" and "BODY" elements, since there is no way for an author to provide an image only for those browsers that support "fixed".&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Subtle Art of Being A Developer Advocate</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/wassimchegham/the-subtle-art-of-being-a-developer-advocate-gdg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wrote this article called "&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-the-heck-is-a-developer-advocate-87ab4faccfc4/"&gt;What the heck is a developer advocate?&lt;/a&gt;" which tried to help people in the tech industry understand what this role entails. Yet, I still get tons of questions on Twitter about this role.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am going to try to demystify the role of a Developer Advocate by giving, this time, concrete examples of tasks and activities I do on my day-to-day job working as a Senior Developer Advocate at Microsoft, and as someone who's been doing developer advocacy since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disclaimer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disclaimer:
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Views expressed in this post are my own and do not represent my employer nor my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first shed some light on the difference between a Developer Advocate and a Technology Evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#developer-advocate-and-technology-evangelist"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Developer Advocate and Technology Evangelist
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain confusion between Developer Advocacy and Technology Evangelism. Let's look at both terms' definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the term "tech evangelist" was invented by Apple as part of their initiative to persuade developers to create apps for Macintosh. The verb "persuade" is very important because it implies that an Evangelist would try to convince developers to adopt a certain technology without necessarily listening, or caring about their needs or opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the opposite of what Advocacy is all about!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Advocacy" is an old concept that comes from the Medieval Latin word "advocare" which means "to add a voice". The term "advocate" comes from Old French word "avocat" which means "a lawyer". So, an Advocate literarily means someone who "pleads a case or a cause", who "argues that something needs to be changed or improved".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to the tech industry, these two terms may seem quite similar but the subtle difference lies in the fact that a Tech. Evangelist role is done one-way only (outbound), and a Developer Advocate role is considered two-way (outbound and inbound). In other words, a Tech Evangelist would typically be interested in convincing developers that certain technology is what they need. A Developer Advocate would typically be interested in listening to developers' needs and providing them with the most adequate help. A Developer Advocate also collects developers' feedback and advocates for them internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the two titles should be used wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I want to take a step back to highlight that beyond the theoretical definition, it turns out that in practice there are always some exceptions to what the job titles may entail. I know some of my friends whose job title was Tech Evangelist, but the work they did was more of a Developer Advocate (and vice-versa). What really matters is not the job title but rather what you do to help developers be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8zyQ-dil--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7gu61d6gy428zj4y83zz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8zyQ-dil--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7gu61d6gy428zj4y83zz.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#developer-advocates-and-marketers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Developer Advocates and Marketers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you ask a Developer Advocate to define their role, each one of them will give you a different answer, which is confusing. That's common. But, have you ever wondered why? The main reason for this is that many companies tend to hire Developer Advocates to do different kinds of tasks, from sales to communication and, most commonly, Marketing. Why Marketing? Because companies usually spend between 5 to 12% of their revenue on Marketing, and when they need to reach to more developers, they usually would hire someone as a "Developer Advocate" (or any other variation of this title) who reports to marketing (or business unit) and is driven by marketing and sales KPIs. Most importantly, in this situation, this role is usually led outside of the product engineering team, which might be problematic (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad with companies using marketing and sales to reach out to developers, but doing this under the Developer Advocacy titles umbrella isn't doing anyone a favor. Either way, this usually turns out to be a bad move because not all developers are great at marketing (or sales) and end up not performing well. Developers have excellent ingenuity and creativity but some of us may lack basic business marketing skills. Why do you think most successful startups are founded by at least 2 people? If I were good at Marketing or Sales I would have done a better job promoting my own open-source projects, yet you've never heard about &lt;a href="https://xlayers.dev"&gt;xlayers.dev&lt;/a&gt;. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3niuPYfq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t79tsnseb70spzk8y936.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3niuPYfq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t79tsnseb70spzk8y936.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reaching to developers, Marketing teams should collaborate with Developer Advocates to help them tailor the message for developers. Why? Because Developer Advocates are, before anything else, developers themselves and speak the same language as other developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many other cases, companies simply ignore the true meaning behind Advocacy and end up making their own definition, based on their business needs. That's why almost no Developer Advocate understands what their role is or should be. I hope this article would help somehow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#developer-advocates-and-developer-relations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Developer Advocates and Developer Relations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Developer Relations is the umbrella term for the teams including Developer Advocates, Community Managers, and any team whose responsibility is to create and foster communities of developers. Some larger companies, as we do at Microsoft, also include teams responsible for documentation, events, and social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a Developer Advocacy team is a tiny subset of Developer Relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yjYq1k3e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5d20yko6tc28sy7s0or4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yjYq1k3e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5d20yko6tc28sy7s0or4.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-my-role-at-microsoft"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's my role at Microsoft?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Developer Advocates, we may not agree on what we do or should be doing, but we all agree on one common definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our role is to act as the bridge between internal engineering teams and our developer community. We also advocate for developers internally".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I describe the work I do at Microsoft, let me give you some context: I was hired because of my JavaScript skills and my close relationship with the JavaScript developer community. I currently work as part of the JavaScript advocacy team. Our team belongs to the Developer Relation organization which is part of the Azure Engineering department at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day-to-day job is to advocate for JavaScript developers internally at Microsoft, act as their voice during product team meetings or internal studies. Externally, I support and gather JavaScript developers' feedback so we can improve our products and services. Basically, I help JavaScript developers be successful using Microsoft Clouds, services, and open-source developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've probably seen that Microsoft is raising the bar for its products and to achieve this, the company is investing in Developers and open-source. That's why our &lt;strong&gt;Developer Relations team's mission is to empower developers to achieve more&lt;/strong&gt;. Our larger Developer Advocacy team (or Cloud Developer Advocacy, as we refer to it internally because we are also helping DevOps teams) is composed of multiple sub-teams focusing on different developer communities such as Rust, Java, Python...etc, but also audiences like students, academia, and startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Cloud Developer Advocacy team is to win the hearts and minds of Developers through authenticity, community, and technical engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ihaP-IZg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tebfywwy2jxt22tdi1yd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ihaP-IZg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tebfywwy2jxt22tdi1yd.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-my-typical-day-looks-like-as-a-developer-advocate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What my typical day looks like as a Developer Advocate?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tasks I am going to disclose below are the activities "I" regularly do. My team members may or may not do the "exact" same activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating content
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participate in writing technical documentation and content in different formats used by engineers worldwide. This can be as simple as updating existing documentation or creating full documentation like the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-wachegha"&gt;Azure Static Web Apps documentation&lt;/a&gt; that my team and I collaborated on with the Microsoft documentation team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other content also includes creating and hosting workshops for developers, coding challenges as well as snackable content that I regularly publish on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="ltag__twitter-tweet"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#public-speaking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Public speaking
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the highly visible activities that most Developer Advocates are notorious for is public events. That's also part of my work, giving technical talks, and keynotes at international conferences and events. Basically going where the developers are. This also includes live streamings, podcasts, and similar types of mediums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-tools-in-the-open"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building tools in the open
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the work I do for my company, I am also an active member of the open-source community, and most of the work I do for my employer is done in the Open as well. This means that my job is also to help developers be successful using the tools that help them use and integrate Azure with their products and applications. My recent tools include &lt;a href="https://hexa.run"&gt;https://hexa.run&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nestjs/azure-database"&gt;Nest.JS libraries for Azure CosmosDB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/nestjs/azure-storage"&gt;Azure Storage&lt;/a&gt;. You can check my other open-source work at &lt;a href="https://wassim.dev"&gt;wassim.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#product-feedback"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Product feedback
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuously improving the products and services that developers use is one of our team's core missions. I spend the majority of my time interacting with developers and engineers through social media, or at online or onsite events. I get tons of requests from developers who are asking questions, reporting issues, or asking for feature requests. I always try to help them first, if I am familiar with the product. For major issues or popular feature requests, I create a work item on our internal dashboard and collaborate closely with the product team to improve the experience based on the feedback gathered from the community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really where, as a Developer Advocate, I can advocate for JavaScript developers and act as their voice internally. A recent example of this is with the Azure Static Web Apps product where I spent the last year and a half contributing to the product and helping the engineering team designing part of the service, providing critical feedback, trying early access features, and implementing the CLI developer tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shipping-products"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Shipping products
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other aspect of being a Developer Advocate that many people probably ignore is that as Developer Advocates, some of us also contribute to creating and shipping products, either for internal or external use, or both. For the last 6 months, I had the opportunity to create, lead and ship the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli"&gt;official Azure Static Web Apps CLI&lt;/a&gt; to allow developers to run and debug their apps locally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that's something that every Developer Advocate should be doing because it's essential to understand how a product or a service is designed, implemented, know its strengths and weaknesses. That a knowledge that we will have to have if we need to better help developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#being-the-customer-zero"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Being the Customer Zero
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good amount of my time is spent improving Azure products and services, and working with Azure engineering teams across the company to try out new features, provide feedback about JavaScript developers' expectations. The products I've worked on during the last 2 years were: Azure Functions, Storage, Cosmos DB, IoT, and Static Web Apps. Acting as "customer zero" is a really great way to have a tremendous impact on a product before it gets released. One example of this is Azure Static Web Apps: my team and I are working closely with the engineering team to help provide the best developer experience for the Web developers community who will be using this service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#constantly-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Constantly learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since JavaScript is widely used in many different areas, the technical stacks that I usually focus on include Node.js, TypeScript, Serverless, IoT architectures, databases, and hosting. I also must be honest, I've also been fascinated by the Rust programming language and I am planning to start learning it in the near future! Luckily one of my colleagues on the Rust Advocacy team has built this &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/rust-first-steps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-00000-wachegha"&gt;5 hours free guide about Rust for beginners&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like a good start for me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-and-improving-official-docs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating and improving official docs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Developer Advocate, I also spend some time creating comprehensive technical guides for many Microsoft Clouds services. One of the latest guides that my team and I worked on for 4 months is &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/"&gt;the Node.js Learn Path&lt;/a&gt;. The good thing about our official documentation is that is open and anyone can help improve it. We also regularly participate in this and send Pull Requests to improve and update the docs at &lt;a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-wachegha"&gt;http://docs.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineers' main responsibilities are to own, design, implement, and ship products, and for those who want to share their experience with the developer community, they are able to do it. Developer Advocates are not different than engineers except that their responsibilities are not working full time on products but help the engineering teams reach out and listen to developers' needs in order to create the best experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#developer-advocates-are-engineers-who-love-to-learn-in-the-open"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Developer Advocates are engineers who love to learn in the open.
&lt;/h1&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/saviomartin/set-up-tailwind-in-react-the-fastest-way-2a4d</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hello-folks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hello Folks 👋
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Savio here. I'm young dev with an intention to enhance as a successful web developer. I love building web apps with React. I have proved my superiority in frontend technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'll show you the easiest and the fastest way to set up Tailwind CSS in your React App. So, be with me! Lets code something amazing!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Tailwind CSS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P7Jdchbl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618930600242/rxcg2HQ7j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P7Jdchbl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618930600242/rxcg2HQ7j.png" alt="tailwind.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind is designed to be component friendly. It is so much easier to separate a site's elements into smaller components and not pollute the codebase with objects or extraneous CSS classes. Furthermore, every class is inlined in the component, making it much easier to read and understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-your-react-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create Your React Project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, lets create a react project. Just use the command below to create a react app ⚛️.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app your_react_project_name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup Tailwind CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, lets check how we can setup tailwind css on the react app, we just created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-npm-packages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install NPM Packages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need some NPM packages to setup tailwind. These are the npm packages-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PostCSS:&lt;/strong&gt; A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Autoprefixer:&lt;/strong&gt; PostCSS plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from Can I Use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tailwindcss:&lt;/strong&gt; A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets install all of them, paste the command in the terminal ⬇️.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer postcss-cli &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-raw-tailwindcss-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating &lt;code&gt;tailwind.css&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing NPM packages, let's create a folder named &lt;code&gt;styles&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; folder. Create a new &lt;code&gt;tailwind.css&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;output.css&lt;/code&gt;. Here is the folder structure of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; ⬇️&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/
├── styles/
         ├── output.css
         └── tailwind.css
├── app.js
└── index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, paste the following contents into &lt;code&gt;tailwind.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;utilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leave the &lt;code&gt;output.css&lt;/code&gt; empty. It will be taken care by tailwindcss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-config-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Config Files
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, lets create the config files. First, lets generate the default configuration file on tailwind css. Paste the code ⬇️ and you'll be good to go!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx tailwindcss init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--full&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command generates a &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; with all the default configuration. Now, we have 2 more files to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;tailwindcss-config.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;postcss.config.js&lt;/code&gt; config file by using the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx tailwindcss init tailwindcss-config.js &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, lets not touch the files, we can jump onto the last part!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#edit-raw-packagejson-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Edit &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the last part, it is so simple, we just have to add a new command &lt;code&gt;watch:css&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;. I have made it in the way, every time you start the app, it get automatically called. So, here goes the &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; part of &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"scripts"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run watch:css &amp;amp;&amp;amp; react-scripts start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run watch:css &amp;amp;&amp;amp; react-scripts build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"test"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"react-scripts test"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"eject"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"react-scripts eject"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"watch:css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"postcss src/styles/tailwind.css -o src/styles/output.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, if we just run &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; we can see our &lt;code&gt;output.css&lt;/code&gt; gets filled with the styles of tailwindcss. That means, Everything gone absolutely correct. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing Tailwind CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is time to test. To, use the styles of &lt;code&gt;tailwind&lt;/code&gt;, we have to import &lt;code&gt;output.css&lt;/code&gt; to our &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./styles/output.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that's it. We're good to go! Lets add some tailwind styles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the following code to test your app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./styles/output.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bg-gray-900 p-20 h-screen flex justify-center items-start flex-col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text-5xl text-white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;👋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text-gray-400 mt-5 text-lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Lorem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ipsum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dolor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;amet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;consectetur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;adipisicing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Fugit&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;consequuntur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;odio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nobis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reiciendis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doloremque&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fugiat&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;eveniet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempora&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atque&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;earum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ullam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inventore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;itaque&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sapiente&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;iste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;p-4 bg-green-600 rounded-lg font-bold text-white mt-5 hover:bg-gray-600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Friends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, lets do &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; and check if it is working!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VHWJUKsH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618933369814/9fN9EA_Qe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VHWJUKsH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618933369814/9fN9EA_Qe.png" alt="screenshot (2).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurray 🎉 That's it we could see our good-looking app in the browser. We just made it with a little line of code. That's all! I hope it was fast! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have deployed it! So, have a demo 🚀 &lt;a href="https://create-react-app-tailwind.vercel.app/"&gt;create-react-app-tailwind.vercel.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created a starter repo on &lt;a href="https://github.com/saviomartin/create-react-app-tailwind"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="https://github.com/saviomartin/create-react-app-tailwind"&gt;saviomartin/create-react-app-tailwind&lt;/a&gt;. It would be a good idea if you really wish to avoid these stuffs, just clone the repo and start app. You are good to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star the repository! 🌟 &lt;a href="https://github.com/saviomartin/create-react-app-tailwind"&gt;saviomartin/create-react-app-tailwind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Django Graphs and Charts – Argon Dashboard</title>
      <author>Sm0ke</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 09:57:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sm0ke/django-graphs-and-charts-argon-dashboard-1p0b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sm0ke/django-graphs-and-charts-argon-dashboard-1p0b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello coders, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article presents an open-source sample that might help beginners to learn and code a real project using Django as a backend framework. &lt;strong&gt;Django Argon Charts&lt;/strong&gt; sample provides functional code that shows different metrics regarding a 12mo timeframe: total sales, total orders, best sale, and best month (in sales value). Information is provided using charts, widgets, and a paginated data table that allows editing/adding new sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://django-argon-charts.appseed-srv1.com"&gt;Django Argon Charts&lt;/a&gt; - Sample LIVE deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/app-generator/django-argon-charts"&gt;Django Argon Charts&lt;/a&gt; - Source Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard-django"&gt;Argon Dashboard Django&lt;/a&gt; - the original starter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q4qAwLmb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-generator/static/master/samples/django-argon-charts-import-data.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q4qAwLmb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-generator/static/master/samples/django-argon-charts-import-data.gif" alt="Django Graphs and Charts - Open-source Django sample, animated presentation."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The information displayed in the charts is loaded from a sample file provided along with the source code on Github. On top of this basic provisioning, authenticated users have the option to edit and add new records. Once the new information is saved, charts are automatically updated.  The project can be used by any developer with basic programming knowledge and familiarity with Python.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in the box&lt;/strong&gt; (app features):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A beautiful, modern UI: Argon Dashboard (free version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session-based authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import/Export feature – available in the admin section for bulk import of sample data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charts for orders and sales for a 12mo timeframe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widgets that counts total sales, orders, and best month selected based on the total sales value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paginated data table with &lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;add new record&lt;/strong&gt; option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;To compile the project and play with the code, please follow the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/app-generator/django-argon-charts/blob/master/README.md#how-to-use-it"&gt;build instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provided in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/app-generator/django-argon-charts/blob/master/README.md"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; file. The basic flow is to install the required dependencies, create the database and app tables and load the information using the admin section. Once the information is saved in the database, we can use the UI to play with the information and see the LIVE effects in the charts.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Line Chart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarize the sales for the last 12mo, initially provisioned by a &lt;a href="https://github.com/app-generator/django-argon-charts/blob/master/media/sample_data/orders.csv"&gt;sample file&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PlUwh0RV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lqy1cxg39vxw822y9ssx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PlUwh0RV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lqy1cxg39vxw822y9ssx.png" alt="Django Graphs and Charts - Sample Line Chart."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bar Chart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MZyymX41--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nuq2z1dlqasct7ahucir.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MZyymX41--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nuq2z1dlqasct7ahucir.png" alt="Django Graphs and Charts - Sample Bar Chart."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The visual features are enhanced with a table-based view of the information that allows navigating the database content with ease. The records can be edited and the charts will be refreshed automatically to reflect the latest changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3arzRd_I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a10ggersydl4kg63l6xv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3arzRd_I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a10ggersydl4kg63l6xv.png" alt="Django graphs and charts – edit existing row."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;From this point, the project can be extended with ease to support more advanced features like adding more relevant charts, compute sales predictions using the sales statistics from the previous year or add a social login to speed up the user registration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where do you like to travel the most? 🏔🏝</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As post-vacation, most of the countries are going back to normal. Most of us can travel to close tourists destination keeping precautions in mind. Few of us are even able to do remote work from such places. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm myself in Himachal (India 🇮🇳) since this month, work from there. I have spent most of my vacations here only. It's my second home and every time there is something new that you can find and experience here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="ltag__twitter-tweet"&gt;

      <title>What is "White Screen of Death 💀" (WSoD), and how do you detect it in time? </title>
      <author>kaspera</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 09:27:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kaspera/what-is-white-screen-of-death-wsod-and-how-do-you-detect-it-in-time-28hi</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kaspera/what-is-white-screen-of-death-wsod-and-how-do-you-detect-it-in-time-28hi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚠️ NOTE: This article and its solution are based on our own product - Alertdesk, which is a paid product. If you have an alternative solution to the problem, feel free to post it in the comment below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website errors. They come in all shades and are every website owner's fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that there was an error so cunning that it was named after Death itself? Then you would be scared. Very scared 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BkchoMJYKvU"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we turn down the drama a bit, then "White Screen of Death" (WSoD) is an extremely irritating error. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes your page inaccessible to visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can shut you out of your backend (e.g., the WordPress admin area).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can occur suddenly and without you making any changes yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most "Uptime Monitoring" services will not necessarily catch the error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it mildly, it's annoying as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is the "White Screen of Death," and how does it occur?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-white-screen-of-death"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is White Screen of Death?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xJ_KklCh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuimni596p8ileesirw5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xJ_KklCh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuimni596p8ileesirw5.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"White Screen of Death" is an error that gives the visitor a white/blank screen. There is often no information about the error, just the color white as far as the eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may occur as a result of a PHP and database error. Therefore, it also affects many CMS', including Magento and PrestaShop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where the error is most prevalent is probably at the world's most popular CMS, WordPress, where it has even found a place in the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/common-wordpress-errors/#the-white-screen-of-death"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, this article will also be based on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of a WSoD-error is a faulty plugin or theme. Other reasons can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A syntax error in the code - e.g., if you have made edits yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Memory Limit is set to low in either your wp-config.php file, .htaccess file, or php.ini file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A failed auto-update of WordPress - e.g., due to a server timeout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems with your &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/changing-file-permissions/"&gt;File Permissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-fix-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you fix it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start by finding out what is causing the error. It may sound easier said than done when all you have to work with is a blank screen. But fear not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress has a built-in &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/"&gt;debugging mode&lt;/a&gt; that makes errors visible on your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable it, open your &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/"&gt;wp-config.php file&lt;/a&gt; and find the following line:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;define( 'WP_DEBUG', false);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then change &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt;, so it looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;define( 'WP_DEBUG', true);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Error messages will now be visible on your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are not that much into messing with files, then the &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-debugging/"&gt;WP Debugging plugin&lt;/a&gt; does the same (obviously requires you to be able to get into the WordPress admin area). However, this is Dev.to so this properly isn't the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority of cases, it will be a plugin that is causing the error. You will be able to see the name of the plugin in the error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have access to your WordPress admin area, simply deactivate the plugin on the "Installed plugins"-page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't access the admin area, you can deactivate the plugin manually via an FTP program or your web host's "File Manager"-tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to your plugin folder (wp-content -&amp;gt; plugins) and find the plugin that throws the error. Then rename the folder to something else, e.g., from "hello-dolly" to "hello-dolly-1". The plugin will now be disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Plugins can also be disabled via phpMyAdmin and WP-CLI - I just find this solution the easiest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reload your page and see if the issue is resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#what-can-be-done-to-detect-it-in-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What can be done to detect it in time?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying things about the WSoD error is that it can occur suddenly - even without you actively changing anything on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's worse, if you have traditional "uptime monitoring" enabled, it will not necessarily catch the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ks5CqB37--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/919s9e8fh1q3lugdk8qt.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ks5CqB37--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/919s9e8fh1q3lugdk8qt.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Most services, including Alertdesk, look at your site’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes"&gt;HTTP status code&lt;/a&gt;. If the page gives a status code 2XX or 3XX, it gets interpreted as up, where status code 4XX and 5XX gets interpreted as down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uYuxd3c7ns"&gt;There's got to be a better way!&lt;/a&gt;" you may think - and for fear of sounding like a classic American infomercial: Yes, there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HpF_C52x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/scahqcmtmgzxvgukn8b0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HpF_C52x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/scahqcmtmgzxvgukn8b0.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you set up an Uptime-check in Alertdesk, you have the option to set up specific "rules" for that check. We call this &lt;a href="https://help.alertdesk.com/docs/uptime-check/#5-assertions-rules"&gt;Assertions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the rules you can set up is that a piece of text must be present on the page in order for it to be "up".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a super powerful tool when it comes to checking for WSoD errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the text is not visible (which it won't be in the event of a WSoD error), your check will get marked as "down". You will then get notified immediately by E-mail, Push, Slack, or the channel you have selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to set up an Uptime-check with Assertions in Alertdesk
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by creating an account on Alertdesk. Go to Monitoring, click the &lt;strong&gt;"Add check"&lt;/strong&gt;-button and choose &lt;strong&gt;"Uptime check"&lt;/strong&gt;. Enter your URL and click the &lt;em&gt;"Advanced settings"&lt;/em&gt;-toggle in the right corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Assertions&lt;/strong&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;"Text body"&lt;/strong&gt; under "Source", &lt;strong&gt;Contains&lt;/strong&gt; under "Comparison," and then paste the piece of text that should be present on your page under "Target" (is case sensitive). Then click the &lt;strong&gt;Add&lt;/strong&gt;-button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hEuH-CZ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r6huw9tkr9q6d7w2geh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hEuH-CZ2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r6huw9tkr9q6d7w2geh.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚠️ &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; There may be issues with special characters, as they may be converted to HTML characters instead, which will not match. Therefore use text without special characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click the &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;-button. Select who to notify and then click the &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;-button again. Give your check a name and make sure everything looks fine. Finally, click &lt;strong&gt;Save check&lt;/strong&gt;, and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy lemon squeezy 🍋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now get notified immediately if your website should get a “White Screen of Death” error.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Connecting React project with Firebase</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While developing a web application, developers often have to interact with the database (save and fetch data to and from a database).&lt;br&gt;
This blog post describes an easy way to connect your React project with Firebase database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To read this blog post, you need to be familiar with &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; library and &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/"&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt; database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-firebase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Firebase
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firebase&lt;/strong&gt; is a backend service provided by Google. It contains a &lt;em&gt;database&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;API&lt;/em&gt; to which we can send requests. To start working with this service, you only need a Goggle account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZtIFJaeK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6hl67vrzgojpmqkrmgsa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZtIFJaeK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6hl67vrzgojpmqkrmgsa.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-to-use-firebase-with-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why to use Firebase with React
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use React library in our frontend project, we would not want to connect to database directly. If we do so, we will have security issues. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could simply connect our single page React app in a similar way as we connect a Node.js app (or any other server-side app):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;database-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;SELECT * FROM users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As written in the code above, we could use some database driver/ package (in this example for MySQL) and then use methods exposed by that driver to connect to the database and then run queries against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; if we connect to database like shown above, we have to put all our database credentials and queries directly into our frontend code. This code is accessible by everyone though! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just open the dev tools in browser and see the code - that's how web works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why any code that “talks” to a database belongs onto a server and the users can’t access that code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the way how &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; works with &lt;strong&gt;Firebase&lt;/strong&gt; - React needs a backend API to which it will send HTTP requests and Firebase provides that API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-react-project-with-firebase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting React project with Firebase
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Firebase provides a database API, which accepts a data in a JSON format returns a data in a special format back. React will use this API to fetch data from it or to send data to it to store into database (buy using methods POST and GET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To configure a Firebase, just simply follow the steps on &lt;a href="https://firebase.google.com/"&gt;Firebase official page&lt;/a&gt;. Below Ill write down them shortly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click Get Started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a new project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to Realtime Database (on the left side) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create database &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose "Start in test mode"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you got your database and API link (see screenshot below):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xKVZ4B9L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/izdadov677cqhe70d3xv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xKVZ4B9L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/izdadov677cqhe70d3xv.png" alt="firebase_api"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was simple :) Now let's use it in our project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume we have a simple React project with a form. The user fills in the form and after button click all info goes to database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Form component will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// Form.js&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We are using refs here to access the value of DOM nodes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;titleRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addressRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;descRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;htmlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title:&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;titleRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;htmlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Image:&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"url"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;htmlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"address"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Address:&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"address"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addressRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;htmlFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"desc"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Description:&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Add&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the user fills in the required fields in the form and click on Add button, the form will trigger &lt;code&gt;onSubmit&lt;/code&gt; event, which in its turn will call a method &lt;code&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
This method creates an object, which we will use to &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt; the user's data to the database:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enteredData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;titleRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addressRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;descRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can send &lt;code&gt;enteredData&lt;/code&gt; object to the database by using API provided by database and JavaScript method &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;accepts as parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;path&lt;/strong&gt; (in our case - Firebase API link)
Note: When we use the Firebase API link as path, we need to add the name of data we store and &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; to the end (for example, if we store todos, we add &lt;code&gt;todos.json&lt;/code&gt; to the end of API link)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;init object&lt;/strong&gt; with number of different settings &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we use &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; just with &lt;strong&gt;path&lt;/strong&gt;, it will execute GET method by default. Since we want to send data, we need to add second parameter and specify that we want to use POST method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/code&gt; method now would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;enteredData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;titleRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;imageRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addressRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;descRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://test-a02ef-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/info.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;enteredData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the user provided all required data to the form and clicked &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; button, the form sends the data to database. We can refresh our Firebase project and see the data being stored there. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Firebase we can store our data to the database. We can also fetch the data from our database and render it to the page we need by using the same API link provided by Firebase. It might look as if we are interacting directly with a database, but now we know that this is not what’s happening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, services like Firebase give you a backend which is kind of hidden from the user and we only use that backend API to interact with the database.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chrome Dino Game using Python...</title>
      <author>Dhruv Panchal</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dhhruv/chrome-dino-game-using-python-2595</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Replica of the hidden Dinosaur Game from Chrome Browser Offline mode so you don't have to be offline to play it...😂😂&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The Dinosaur Game, also known as the &lt;strong&gt;T-Rex Game, Steve the Jumping Dinosaur, or Dino Runner&lt;/strong&gt; and initially codenamed Project Bolan, is a built-in browser game in the &lt;strong&gt;Google Chrome Web Browser&lt;/strong&gt;. The game was created by &lt;strong&gt;Sebastien Gabriel in 2014&lt;/strong&gt;, and can be accessed by hitting the space bar when in offline mode on Google Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The following represents a recreated version of the famous Dinosaur Game from Chrome Browser Offline mode implemented using &lt;strong&gt;Python and PyGame&lt;/strong&gt;. The project file contains &lt;strong&gt;Image Files&lt;/strong&gt; and a python script &lt;strong&gt;(chromedino.py)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A simple and easy-to-use GUI is provided for better gameplay. The gameplay design is so simple that the user won’t find it difficult to use and understand. Different images are used in the development of this simple game project, the gaming environment is just like the original Chrome Dino Run game. For demo of the project, have a look at the GIF below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vp8XqYkH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gmqwaosjf703c2gnrjba.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vp8XqYkH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gmqwaosjf703c2gnrjba.gif" alt="Dino GIF"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  First of all, &lt;strong&gt;clone the repository&lt;/strong&gt; using:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/dhhruv/Chrome-Dino-Runner.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Download the Zip and extract it's contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Then download the dependencies in your Command Prompt OR Terminal using:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  After installation, just run the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhhruv/Chrome-Dino-Runner/blob/master/chromedino.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;chromedino.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python chromedino.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#input"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Input:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Keys&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Any Key&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Press any key to Start the Game.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;↑&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;Up Arrow&lt;/code&gt; to jump and avoid cacti.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;↓&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;Down Arrow&lt;/code&gt; to duck and avoid pterodactyls.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, stay tuned for further updates on GitHub:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quelle est la différence entre un site Web et une application Web?</title>
      <author>lawalalao</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 08:44:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lawalalao/quelle-est-la-difference-entre-un-site-web-et-une-application-web-2ml1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lawalalao/quelle-est-la-difference-entre-un-site-web-et-une-application-web-2ml1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Il est généralement difficile pour un utilisateur final de faire la différence entre une application Web et un site Web. Ils tapent simplement l'URL et boum, les résultats sont là.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Et c'est ce qui compte vraiment pour l'utilisateur: obtenir les résultats pour ce qu'il recherche. Si cela se produit, c'est essentiellement ce dont ils se soucient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mais pour vous en tant que développeur, c'est vous qui devez créer ces produits pour l'utilisateur. Vous devez donc bien connaître leurs différences. Connaissez-vous les principales différences entre un site Web et une application Web?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nous adopterons une approche technique de base dans cet article. Et bien qu'il y ait des opinions contradictoires parmi certains développeurs, je vais essayer de mettre en évidence certaines des différences clés qui m'ont aidé à comprendre en quoi les sites Web et les applications Web diffèrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commençons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#questce-quun-site-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Qu'est-ce qu'un site Web?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zjb8aPA---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617986470434/gKzdMD0h1.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zjb8aPA---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617986470434/gKzdMD0h1.jpeg" alt="4fdfe883e72834c012b96b359f121156.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un site Web est un ensemble de pages Web associées contenant des images, du texte, de l'audio, de la vidéo, etc. Il peut se composer d'une page ou de plusieurs pages, et il fournit à la fois un contenu visuel et textuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Il existe de nombreux types de sites Web, par exemple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sites de rencontre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sites de blogs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sites communautaires&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sites pédagogiques&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moteurs de recherche&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Et plus...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voici quelques exemples de sites Web: Wikipedia, Google, Amazon et Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#caract%C3%A9ristiques-dun-site-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Caractéristiques d'un site Web.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C'est convivial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Il peut être facilement recherché à l'aide d'un moteur de recherche&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Il affiche un contenu de qualité&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Il devrait avoir une mise en page pour une facilite de naviguation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pourquoi-vous-pourriez-avoir-besoin-dun-site-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pourquoi vous pourriez avoir besoin d'un site Web.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vous aurez peut-être besoin d'un site Web pour présenter vos produits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un site Web vous aide à établir une marque pour votre entreprise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cela aide à créer une preuve sociale afin que les autres puissent voir ce que vous faites et avez fait&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Il vous donne une présence en ligne afin que vos clients puissent vous trouver&lt;br&gt;
Vous pouvez l'utiliser pour faire de la publicité et faire connaître votre marque&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  Qu'est-ce qu'une application Web?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dML8sMsI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617986453135/tQUFxN_6r.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dML8sMsI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1617986453135/tQUFxN_6r.gif" alt="web-application.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Une application Web est un logiciel accessible par le navigateur. En d'autres termes, nous pouvons dire que les applications Web sont des sites Web dotés de fonctionnalités et d'éléments interactifs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les applications Web sont extrêmement personnalisables et peuvent effectuer un large éventail de tâches et de fonctionnalités. Ils sont généralement plus complexes et difficiles à construire, et ils nécessitent une équipe expérimentée de développeurs de logiciels pour les créer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Quelques exemples d'applications Web populaires sont Twitter, Facebook, Gmail, Adobe CC et Youtube.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#caract%C3%A9ristiques-dune-application-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Caractéristiques d'une application Web.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ils sont pour la plupart multiplateformes, ce qui signifie qu'ils devraient pouvoir travailler sur n'importe quelle plateforme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ils sont facilement testés avec des tests automatisés&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ils sont hébergés dans le cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pourquoi-vous-pourriez-avoir-besoin-dune-application-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pourquoi vous pourriez avoir besoin d'une application Web
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ils peuvent être utilisés sur n'importe quelle plate-forme car ils prennent en charge tous les navigateurs modernes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vous n'avez pas besoin de l'approbation de l'App Store pour avoir une application Web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les utilisateurs peuvent y accéder à tout moment depuis n'importe où&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ils peuvent être utilisés à la fois sur des appareils mobiles ou des ordinateurs de bureau pour accéder aux données&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ils sont plus faciles à gérer car ils utilisent le même code dans toute l'application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#diff%C3%A9rences-cl%C3%A9s-entre-site-web-et-application-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Différences clés entre site Web et application Web
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Résumons quelques-unes des principales différences entre les deux:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. INTERACTION DE L'UTILISATEUR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un site Web fournit un contenu visuel et textuel que l'utilisateur peut voir et lire, mais cela n'affecte pas le fonctionnement du site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dans une application Web, l'utilisateur n'affiche pas seulement le contenu de la page, mais manipule également les données. L'utilisateur peut interagir individuellement en remplissant des formulaires ou en fournissant les données requises pour interagir avec l'application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. AUTHENTIFICATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L'authentification n'est pas toujours nécessaire pour les sites Web basés sur des informations. L'utilisateur peut être invité à s'inscrire pour obtenir des mises à jour régulières pour accéder à des options supplémentaires, et c'est tout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les applications Web ont besoin d'une authentification car elles offrent un éventail d'options et de fonctionnalités/interactivité beaucoup plus large qu'un site Web. Cela signifie que vous devez avoir un nom d'utilisateur et un mot de passe pour accéder à votre compte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. TÂCHES ET COMPLEXITÉ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un site Web n'affichera que les données et informations collectées sur une page spécifique telle que recherchée par l'utilisateur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dans une application Web, les fonctions sont plus élevées et plus complexes par rapport à celles d'un site Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. CRÉÉ POUR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un site Web se compose principalement de contenu statique. Cela signifie que les informations sont accessibles publiquement à tous les visiteurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Une application Web est conçue pour interagir avec l'utilisateur final. Cela signifie que sans les informations d'identification requises, vous ne pourrez peut-être pas accéder aux données.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. DÉPLOIEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorsqu'il s'agit d'un site Web, les petits changements ne nécessitent jamais une recompilation et un déploiement complets. Il vous suffit de mettre à jour le code HTML et tout sera mis à jour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Désormais, lorsqu'il s'agit d'une application Web, vous devez recompiler et redéployer l'application chaque fois que vous apportez des modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le développement d'un site Web est un processus relativement simple. Mais la création d'une application Web nécessite des connaissances plus approfondies, plus d'expérience et plus de planification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenant que vous avez une compréhension plus claire des différences entre les sites Web et les applications Web, vous devriez également avoir une meilleure compréhension de celle dont vous avez vraiment besoin. Vous devriez également être en mesure de dire avec quoi vous interagissez quotidiennement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si vous avez lu jusqu'ici, je l'apprécie vraiment!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/mrdanishsaleem/12-important-http-status-codes-their-meaning-3223</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 200: OK&lt;/strong&gt; - status code indicates that the request has succeeded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 201: CREATED&lt;/strong&gt; - request has succeeded and a new resource has been created&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 204: NO CONTENT&lt;/strong&gt; - server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return a response body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 304: NOT MODIFIED&lt;/strong&gt; - Indicates the client that the response has not been modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 400: BAD REQUEST&lt;/strong&gt; - The request could not be understood by the server due to incorrect syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 401: UNAUTHORIZED&lt;/strong&gt; - the request requires user authentication information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 403: FORBIDDEN&lt;/strong&gt; - client does not have access rights to the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 404: NOT FOUND&lt;/strong&gt; - The server cannot find the requested resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 409: CONFLICT&lt;/strong&gt; - request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 500: INTERNAL SERVER ERROR&lt;/strong&gt; - server encountered an unexpected condition which prevents it from fulfilling the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 503: SERVICE UNAVAILABLE&lt;/strong&gt; - The server is not ready to handle the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 504: GATEWAY TIMEOUT&lt;/strong&gt; - The server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time for a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 1xx: Informational&lt;/strong&gt; - Communicates transfer protocol-level information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 2xx: Success&lt;/strong&gt; - Indicates that the client's request was accepted successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 3xx: Redirection&lt;/strong&gt; - Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 4xx: Client Error&lt;/strong&gt; - This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• 5xx: Server Error&lt;/strong&gt; - The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you know other status code. Let me know in the comment section. Thanks, 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 helpful ways to manage Impostor Syndrome</title>
      <author>DeltaShoppe</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 08:40:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/deltashoppe/7-helpful-ways-to-manage-impostor-syndrome-1071</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/deltashoppe/7-helpful-ways-to-manage-impostor-syndrome-1071</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-exactly-is-impostor-syndrome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What exactly is impostor syndrome?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, you are given a task that nobody else has managed to do so far. However, not only do you fail but your performance is worst than your other peers. This one event can completely transform your self-confidence. The whole phenomenon of the personality can go into negativity, to a point where the feeling of being substandard starts to sound better. This is called impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-why-failure-to-begin-with"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But why failure to begin with?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are to determine the initial reluctance of taking on a challenge that is different from your previous experiences, then the best way to feel about it is what your gut tells you. Moreover, the ability to move forward with that challenge is also an interesting aspect to look into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example-software-industry"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example: Software Industry
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every software engineer in the industry is facing a diversified number of tasks as the delegation of the tasks are multifaceted. &lt;br&gt;
But how does this point out impostor syndrome? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common occurrence in the software industry, the causes of impostor syndrome could be due to multiple factors. Popular ones are being overcritical, not properly able to consume the technicalities of the task, and even a point where one task is not being able to meet the requirements that shatter down the confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#addressing-impostor-syndrome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Addressing impostor syndrome...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to address the problem of impostor syndrome, one must find the root cause first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-start-with-the-basics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's start with the basics:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with our example of the software industry, some of the most common JD's for software engineers include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be exceptionally good at coding using the latest technologies.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of the codebase architecture, technologies, programming languages, and frameworks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to deliver quality solutions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand different business logics to work with i.e. Must have worked on projects with different industries &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other interpersonal skills that also develop with time e.g. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good team player &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open to ideas &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who ticks in if not all but most of the boxes above should be the most ideal candidate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-troubling-part"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The troubling part:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the strengths that somehow turn into weaknesses in some of us. Even the most ideal candidate can become troubled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason: Setting greater standards which if not met brings an internal shakedown in confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can lead to the belief that one is not just good enough because the standards set were far greater and now there is a mountain to climb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although climbing the mountain should be taken as a motivation, but the opposite of it is also very true. This is where impostor syndrome comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-most-common-sign-of-impostor-syndrome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the most common sign of impostor syndrome?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common sign of an impostor syndrome effect is the individual not meeting expectations of the goal that were set initially. At times, having doubt in all the hard work being put in and falling into the trap of developing fears over competence and skills i.e. not being good enough to take on a challenging task are clear signs of the impostor syndrome effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overthinking causes negative impressions which can undermine your performance. The most appealing aspect is that because of working on a diversified number of projects, one does feel overwhelmed at times. This overwhelming effect can result in negative thinking for e.g., doing a project for a different kind of industry for the very first time can actually have the effect of impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being proficient technically, the understanding part of the industry is at times a little difficult. Moreover, the task at hand is arduous and the overall zest to feel good on taking a challenging task becomes less fun and more sporadic. This affects everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while this is a mental phenomenon, there are certain things where a solution lies to these underlying issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-7-helpful-ways-to-manage-impostor-syndrome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are 7 helpful ways to manage impostor syndrome:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop assuming&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
One should stop assuming things will go bad, instead go back to the basics. At times going back to the drawing board and starting from scratch can change the overall perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Discussing the problem with those who matter will help. It will give you a feeling of inclusiveness. Talking creates a lot of difference.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restart with small steps&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Create small goals that you can achieve. It will help regain confidence in yourself. Go easy on yourself, just do the first few basic things right. Build on that momentum, record the peaks, and celebrate on the small things because that will help you stand up again.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This too shall pass&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Work with the skills that you are best at and acknowledge yourself. Maybe you are not familiar with the technology but you can always trust your skills. You didn’t master to learn the computer in a single day but you eventually stood up and were able to move from something basic like Hello World to something more complex and managed to succeed at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing's perfect, but you can make it better&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It’s not about perfection, it’s more about putting in efforts to bring quality. Nothing is perfect. There is no perfect solution. Ever heard of maintenance and technical support. Yes, the quality with which the work is done shall matter. Start with the aim of let’s run this thing first, then go on and change the face of it with let’s run this thing better. Make it better every time. The better it gets, the more quality it meets. It’s not about perfection. It’s all about persistence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give yourself some leverage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
You are destined to achieve greatness but along the way, you will make mistakes. It’s not the end of the world. Take notes from when things start going bad, start focusing primarily on the mistakes first and try to rectify them. Most of us were never that perfect when we first started coding. How many of you aced running the Hello World code really well the very first time?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowly begin taking responsibility again&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The more you adapt to taking responsibility, the easier things will become. It will help you gain focus on the task. Further, it will help in bringing out better solutions to your work. Moreover, at times the frame of mind completely starts operating differently when responsibility comes in. You start to feel that there is a solution that fits right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-can-happen-to-the-best-of-us"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It can happen to the best of us:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right here, right now, we do feel burdened, reading lines of codes daily, understanding the depth of the problem in many projects, and what not. This does affect mental well-being but it doesn’t mean that one should undermine their efforts put into these lines of code. The art of fun lies in taking on different challenges rather than shying away. The mindset that we have done the best in this and we can’t make it better is overrated. It's a question of belief in your ability and understanding you can go wrong. But that doesn't mean you will be stand exposed, it would only mean that you are learning and do not hesitate to show that you can learn. One should rather be more inclined towards let’s make it better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e0fn0tlR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5m40cctcdr9fm49wd6h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e0fn0tlR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5m40cctcdr9fm49wd6h.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-all-about-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It's all about you:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how to deal with impostor syndrome completely depends on you and only you alone. Trust your instinct and you can certainly manage the impostor syndrome anxiety and become helpful to others too in this manner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with impostor syndrome? Share your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optimize your API responses using DTOs</title>
      <author>Abdulcelil Cercenazi</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 08:28:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jarjanazy/optimize-your-api-responses-using-dtos-io4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jarjanazy/optimize-your-api-responses-using-dtos-io4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is it? 🧠
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DTO is short for &lt;strong&gt;Data Transfer Object&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-we-need-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do we need it? 🤔
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows us to decouple domain objects from objects we present to the client.&lt;br&gt;
It helps us present customizable views of our domain objects to the client.&lt;br&gt;
It helps us deliver only the necessary data to the client, thus making our responses smaller and easier to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an example of this use case, there was a page in our front-end application that was taking a long time to load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After investigation, we noticed that the backend was sending a response with a lot of data inside of it, thus making its processing time longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We then, applied the DTO principle and sent only the needed data thus resulting in &lt;strong&gt;5x&lt;/strong&gt; faster response time.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-do-it-%F0%9F%9B%A0"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to do it? 🛠
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the business object from the persistence layer (database for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new DTO object using values from the business object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the DTO to the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-lets-code-a-bit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok, let's code a bit ⚙️⚙️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have a domain class called &lt;strong&gt;Shipment&lt;/strong&gt;🚚&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;lombok.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Setter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Builder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Shipment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;serialNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A mock persistence layer 🗂 (database for example) to get Shipment records&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// methods to get Shipment from database &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A DTO for admins' 👷🏿‍♂️ view of the Shipment&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;lombok.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Setter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Builder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Shipment_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;serialNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another DTO for users' 👷🏿‍♀️ view of the Shipment&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;lombok.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Setter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Builder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Shipment_UserDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A service to get the Shipment from the repository, convert it to a DTO, and return it to the client&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;lombok.AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentRepository&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipment_UserDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipment_ForUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipmentById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getShipment_UserDTO_FromShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;orElseThrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Shipment Not Found"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipment_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipment_ForAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipmentById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getShipment_AdminDTO_FromShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;orElseThrow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Shipment Not Found"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipment_UserDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipment_UserDTO_FromShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Shipment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Shipment_UserDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getShipmentDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getProductCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getOwner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipment_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipment_AdminDTO_FromShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Shipment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Shipment_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getProductCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getOwner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An example response for an admin DTO could be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"productCode"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"VVV"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"serialNumber"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"3XX"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An example response for a user DTO could be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"shipmentDate"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"04/16/2021"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"productCode"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ZZZ"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"owner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jalil"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#important-note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Important Note 👇🏼 👇🏼
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's preferable to not return a list Of DTOs as a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say in the future we would like to return another field alongside the list of DTOs, like their total count, or some other metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, we might break other people's code that is using our API and expecting a list of objects to find an object with inner fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it had an object from the beginning, we could add fields to it without breaking code that uses our API.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A code example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;lombok.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Setter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@AllArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Shipments_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipment_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipment_adminDTOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipments_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getShipments_ForAdmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Shipment_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipment_adminDTOS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;getAllShipments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getShipment_AdminDTO_FromShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;toList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;  

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Shipments_AdminDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shipment_adminDTOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
