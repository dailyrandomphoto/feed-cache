      <title>What are basic string methods in Python?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Python, strings are immutable.This means that they can not be modified.So if we wanted to repair a typo in string,we can’t simply modify the incorrect character.&lt;br&gt;
We would need to create a replacement string with typo corrected.We can also assign a replacement value to the variable holding our string.&lt;br&gt;
If we aren’t sure what the index of our type is, we will use the string method index to locate it and return the index. lets say we’ve the string”lions tigers and bears” within the variable animals.We can locate the index that contains the letter g using animals index(“9”), which can return the index; during this case 8.&lt;br&gt;
We can also use sub strings to locate the index where the sub string begins, animal index(“bears”) would return 17, since that is the start of the sub string.If there’s quite one match for a sub string, the index method will return the primary match.If we attempt to locate a sub string that does not exist within the string, we’ll receive a worth Error explaining that the sub string wasn’t found.&lt;br&gt;
We can avoid a worth Error by first checking if the sub string exists within the string.This can be done using the in keyword.&lt;br&gt;
In this case, it is a conditional which will be either True or False.If the sub string is found within the string, it’ll be True, if the sub string isn’t found within the string, it’ll be False.&lt;br&gt;
Using our previous variable animals, we will do “horses” in animals to see if the sub string “horses” is found in our variable.In this case, it might evaluate to False,since horses aren’t included in our example string.If we did “tigers” in animals, we’d get True, since this sub string is contained in our string. &lt;br&gt;
 Method                                             Description&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the importance of IQ?</title>
      <author>Jacqueline R. Swearingen</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 10:18:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/real-iq-test/what-is-the-importance-of-iq-1flb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/real-iq-test/what-is-the-importance-of-iq-1flb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time you probably hear about your child’s IQ is when there is some question about their abilities in school, whether it’s above or below expectations. This often misunderstood concept is foreign to most people, perhaps with the exception of those quick tests that they offer online. You know the ones to which I refer. But, IQ in relation to what it means for assessment, academics, and even expectations, merits serious attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-iq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is IQ?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person’s reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. &lt;a href="https://iqcertificate.org/real-iq-test"&gt;Real IQ tests&lt;/a&gt; begin to assess this by measuring short- and long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should know his/her IQ score and use it to evaluate one’s self, but indiscriminately, objectivity should be maintained. For some people, knowing their IQ helps boost their self confidence and morale, and eggs them on to attempt new things, fight challenges or to tax their mental resources and stretch the arch to scale greater heights. For others, it may have adverse effects. Learning that one’s IQ is below average, can be a shattering experience. They may withdraw into themselves and tag themselves complete losers who would never taste any fruit of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-iq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding IQ
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence quotients are definitely useful and can be instrumental in clinical practice and education, but it is important to remember what such tests are and aren’t good for. An IQ score tells a story but not always the whole story. It can be critical for helping someone on the road to success but not crippling. And it can be informative to know and sometimes unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ride-hailing App Development: Technology Stack to Build a Taxi Booking App</title>

      <link>https://dev.to/wenttworth/ride-hailing-app-development-technology-stack-to-build-a-taxi-booking-app-289l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/wenttworth/ride-hailing-app-development-technology-stack-to-build-a-taxi-booking-app-289l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kFcVPkZn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aalhcmeh6gh5wc3ognl0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kFcVPkZn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aalhcmeh6gh5wc3ognl0.png" alt="Ride-hailing App Development"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ride-Hailing is a developing service that is preferred by many people at present. The obvious advantages of ride-hailing or ride-sharing are that the cost of traveling from the source to the destination is reduced drastically, pollution is under control, and the maintenance cost is decreased. When you share a ride, you will be paying 50% of the share or lesser than that. The share percentage varies based on the number of people sharing the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber and Lyft are the most well-established companies that provide ride-sharing services effectively to their customers. Their taxi service began a few years back, and ever since, they have an online-based portal or app and went on to become an instant success in the market. They introduced the concept of ride-hailing to customers, and users were attracted by the low cost and safety features that are provided by the taxi companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of technological approaches is involved in building an app like Uber. When developing an Uber like app or a taxi booking app, the following essential parts of an app needs to employ the following technology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backend of the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App development for Android/iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web or app design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-backend-of-the-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The backend of the app
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the backend interface for an application is highly important. It is responsible for connecting the apt functions to the concerned icons or options. For instance, if you tap the register icon or button, the registration form should be displayed correctly. Likewise, the developer has to connect the suitable functionality with the correct option. The backend structure formation is the initial stage of the Uber Clone app development. To build a strong foundation for the backend, developers can make use of the JavaScript or Python language to link the app to the correct interface. The next step in this stage is to decide how to store the app data. Database systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, or any other system can be used, and the data can be securely stored in it. The development of the backend structure is very time consuming, and you will require a lot of resources to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#website-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Website Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proceeding phase in the technology stack is the development of a set of web pages or a website. The app will need a web portal using which the administrator or the end-user can gain access to the app using a desktop system also. For each web page, code has to be written for the client-side, server-side, and for the database. For web development, languages such as Java, Python, CSS/HTML, and more can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#app-development-for-androidios"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  App Development for Android/iOS
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing a ride-hailing app, customers with both Android and iOS devices must be targeted for obtaining a higher rate of success. The backend interface will be the same for the Android/iOS app. Only the tools that are used to develop the app and the framework employed will be different. To construct an Android or iOS app, you can make use of PHP, Java, HTML5, and other languages. Write the code based on the requirements posed by the client, and you can launch it in the App Store or Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ios-tech"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  iOS Tech
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WosrD2n2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ko1k1ij6w7jjkve7u12j.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WosrD2n2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ko1k1ij6w7jjkve7u12j.PNG" alt="Taxi App iOS Tech"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#android-tech"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Android tech
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uF8O7KRz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hj87oot277u9ugcar004.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uF8O7KRz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hj87oot277u9ugcar004.PNG" alt="Android App iOS Tech"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-or-app-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web or App Design
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design or the layout required for the website or the app you are going to develop is very much important. It includes graphic designing, interface designing, coding, user experience design, and basic SEO guidelines. Attractive backgrounds and pictures will generate more traffic to the site. Motion graphics can also be used to make the site appealing. There are several web design tools such as DreamWeaver, Panic Coda, Photoshop, and more that will help in designing the layout of a website or application. For the coding part, you can make use of any programming languages that are in the trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the following components are implemented or designed using various techniques, tools, and coding languages, the end product will be an efficient website or app for the ride-hailing service. Be sure about the requirements and design of the app before you begin the development process. Fix a programming language of your choice to develop the app. Follow the above-specified technology stack to develop a complete app with all the features you require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#to-conclude"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  To Conclude
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small scale organizations that want to construct an app like Uber can opt to use an &lt;a href="https://www.appdupe.com/uber-for-x-clone-script"&gt;Uber Clone app&lt;/a&gt;. It is a clone of the Uber app that will help you spread out your business to many customers. It has all the necessary features in it, and the facility of including or excluding any element of the app is also available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Tailwind CSS breadcrumb component</title>
      <author>Zoltán Szőgyényi</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 10:06:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/themesberg/building-a-tailwind-css-breadcrumb-components-nl8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/themesberg/building-a-tailwind-css-breadcrumb-components-nl8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tailwind CSS is a framework that I've been using for quite some time and I must say that I've completely discarded the possibility to work with any other framework in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one particular thing that I feel lacking when building new projects: the necessity to build the web components over and over such as buttons, dropdowns, navigation bars, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o40SgiQr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2mlhb5gd3ct8bn211d54.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o40SgiQr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2mlhb5gd3ct8bn211d54.png" alt="Tailwind CSS breadcrumb component"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started a series of tutorials where I show you how to build the most commonly used web components on the web and today I want to show you how you can build a breadcrumb component using the utility classes from Tailwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwind-css-breadcrumb-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tailwind CSS breadcrumb component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breadcrumb component is a commonly used element for websites to show the current location of a page in a hierarchical structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of semantics we should use a nav element and an order list element with links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first code the HTML only.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav aria-label="Breadcrumb"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href="#"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href="#"&amp;gt;Projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li aria-current="page"&amp;gt;FlowBite&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we also used the &lt;code&gt;aria-*&lt;/code&gt; attributes to also make the component accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should use the &lt;code&gt;aria-current="page"&lt;/code&gt; attribute on the currently active page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the HTML ready we should start styling the breadcrumb component. Let's start with the &lt;code&gt;nav&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ol&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav class="flex" aria-label="Breadcrumb"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol class="inline-flex items-center space-x-1 md:space-x-3"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href="#"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href="#"&amp;gt;Projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li aria-current="page"&amp;gt;FlowBite&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great, now let's start styling each of the &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; elements inside the list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav class="flex" aria-label="Breadcrumb"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol class="inline-flex items-center space-x-1 md:space-x-3"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href="#"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href="#"&amp;gt;Projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center" aria-current="page"&amp;gt;FlowBite&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome! Now let's style the link elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav class="flex" aria-label="Breadcrumb"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol class="inline-flex items-center space-x-1 md:space-x-3"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 inline-flex items-center" href="#"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 ml-1 md:ml-2 text-sm font-medium" href="#"&amp;gt;Projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center" aria-current="page"&amp;gt;FlowBite&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's finally also add the SVG arrows so that the component gets it final form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav class="flex" aria-label="Breadcrumb"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol class="inline-flex items-center space-x-1 md:space-x-3"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href="#" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;svg class="w-5 h-5 mr-2.5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;path d="M10.707 2.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 0l-7 7a1 1 0 001.414 1.414L4 10.414V17a1 1 0 001 1h2a1 1 0 001-1v-2a1 1 0 011-1h2a1 1 0 011 1v2a1 1 0 001 1h2a1 1 0 001-1v-6.586l.293.293a1 1 0 001.414-1.414l-7-7z"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
        Home
      &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class="flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;svg class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-400" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.293 14.707a1 1 0 010-1.414L10.586 10 7.293 6.707a1 1 0 011.414-1.414l4 4a1 1 0 010 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href="#" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 ml-1 md:ml-2 text-sm font-medium"&amp;gt;Projects&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li aria-current="page"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class="flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;svg class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-400" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.293 14.707a1 1 0 010-1.414L10.586 10 7.293 6.707a1 1 0 011.414-1.414l4 4a1 1 0 010 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;span class="text-gray-400 ml-1 md:ml-2 text-sm font-medium"&amp;gt;FlowBite&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_qLYPYjU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xpc453tzwwf63kb0piq7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_qLYPYjU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xpc453tzwwf63kb0piq7.png" alt="Tailwind CSS Breadcrumb"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#breadcrumb-with-colorful-backgrounds"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Breadcrumb with colorful backgrounds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use this example to build a breadcrumb element using a colored background:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav class="flex bg-blue-50 text-blue-700 border border-blue-200 py-3 px-5 rounded-lg mb-4" aria-label="Breadcrumb"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ol class="inline-flex items-center space-x-1 md:space-x-3"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li class="inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a href="#" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 inline-flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;svg class="w-5 h-5 mr-2.5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;path d="M10.707 2.293a1 1 0 00-1.414 0l-7 7a1 1 0 001.414 1.414L4 10.414V17a1 1 0 001 1h2a1 1 0 001-1v-2a1 1 0 011-1h2a1 1 0 011 1v2a1 1 0 001 1h2a1 1 0 001-1v-6.586l.293.293a1 1 0 001.414-1.414l-7-7z"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
        Home
      &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class="flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;svg class="w-6 h-6 text-blue-400" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.293 14.707a1 1 0 010-1.414L10.586 10 7.293 6.707a1 1 0 011.414-1.414l4 4a1 1 0 010 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href="#" class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900 ml-1 md:ml-2 text-sm font-medium"&amp;gt;Templates&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;li aria-current="page"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class="flex items-center"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;svg class="w-6 h-6 text-blue-400" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.293 14.707a1 1 0 010-1.414L10.586 10 7.293 6.707a1 1 0 011.414-1.414l4 4a1 1 0 010 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z" clip-rule="evenodd"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/path&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;span class="text-blue-400 ml-1 md:ml-2 text-sm font-medium"&amp;gt;FlowBite&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! I hope that this tutorial helps you with your Tailwind CSS journey and your project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>For a Newbie, by a Veteran Newbie</title>
      <author>Shruti Santosh</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 09:54:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shrutisantosh/for-a-newbie-by-a-veteran-newbie-2bip</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shrutisantosh/for-a-newbie-by-a-veteran-newbie-2bip</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is more like a letter to my freshman self. I am a computer science senior now. And I have made a thousand mistakes that I would love to tell other freshmen and sophomore from not very great colleges (probably the tier II and tier III) in India. &lt;br&gt;
(This blog is assuming you know how to print hello world in some programming language)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to start?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are from a not-so-famous university or college, have not taken computer science as major, or don't even attend college, you might feel like getting a good SDE job (because that is what you are studying for, right?) is a hard thing. Well, it depends. &lt;br&gt;
You are among the 1000s of people like you, who are fighting the similar battles like you are. Even though you are the main character of your life, there are other main characters in their own story, which you share too. So it is all intermixed. How do you differentiate from them? How do you not be a part of the herd, and set yourself apart, and noticeable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn&lt;/em&gt;. It is the mantra. Start learning, something, anything, right now. When you are given an opportunity, to attend a hackathon, a workshop, a seminar... grab it. If you learn something new from it, do it. Since you are a newbie, no one is expecting you to have an in depth knowledge about everything. But it is always good to know something rather than nothing. Anything is intimidating? Watch YouTube videos of it. &lt;br&gt;
What to learn? Well, now asking the right questions. So you have observed enough, looked around. Emerging and developing technologies like ML, AI, BlockChain, Cloud computing, yada yada yada, nothing felt like striking a cord? Though it is always good to have a little experience in these emerging technologies, it is not necessary to start with them. They are interesting, but hard to grasp without strong fundamentals, and dedication. So if you didn't feel like they are your cup of tea, let me tell you about a few domains you can actually dig in, and will prove helpful in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive Coding / DSA&lt;br&gt;
So you wanna be a software engineer at Google? Go to AlgoExpert- just kidding. &lt;br&gt;
So competitive programming is a mind sport according to a lot of the top coders. It is basically solving a given problem using code, within the given time period. &lt;br&gt;
Now don't get me wrong. CP is hard, but it is worth knowing and practicing if you are aiming those FAANG companies. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google).&lt;br&gt;
Most competitive programmers got good at it after years of practice, so don't feel sad if you weren't able to solve a few questions. What matters in CP is that you try try try. &lt;br&gt;
The interesting thing about CP is, even if you are not a particularly excellent competitive programmer, the experience in CP will give you an upper hand in most interviews you are gonna face in your life. Interviews are not as hard as CP (generally) so if you practice for CP, interviews are gonna be a piece of cake for you. &lt;br&gt;
This is where I made the mistake. I didn't learn competitive programming and stuff, in my first and second years, thinking I would need the basics, namely trees, graphs, linked lists, and so on, under my belt. I waited for the semesters where these data structures were taught, and by then most of my friends were already good coders. This is because they practiced from youtube, leetcode, geeksforgeeks. They also got placed even before the 4th year started. I would attribute it to their practice of CP and problem solving. There are thousands of easily understandable videos on youtube, books on the internet, and courses on udemy. It all just needs a google search. To start with, you can see videos by William Lin or Nick White, among many, many others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front end Development&lt;br&gt;
This is another interesting domain, and was the first thing I started with. Developing is really cool if you love to build things from scratch.&lt;br&gt;
Front end, I wouldn't say is the easiest, but is the relatively easiest among all the forms of development. It will give you a head start on what development really is. But beaware, don't be fooled by the instant results of it. The thing about of front end is that there are n number of frameworks and languages you can work on. The mistake I did was to learn one, and then be done with it. No! The key to surviving in Tech Industry is to be updated about technologies you like. &lt;br&gt;
To begin with, you can start learning HTML, CSS and JS (a little bit at least) and start making static websites. Static, because it doesn't change, and there is no need of input or dynamic changes in it. There are people like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Prathkum"&gt;Pratham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jh3yy"&gt;Jhey&lt;/a&gt;, and countless amazing people (you can find on twitter just by searching #css) who make magic with just pure CSS. So front end is amazing to start with, and even expertise in, because you can do freelancing and even earn money. There are many other front end frameworks like react.js and svelte and all that makes your life easier. It is good to have a hold of the basics (HTML, CSS, JS) before jumping into these biggies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backend Development&lt;br&gt;
So if you are the stereotypical guy/girl who doesn't like to decorate stuff and come to the logical and nitty gritty of the working of a website, this is for you. Since I am not the said person, backend development is the least ventured domain by me. So my knowledge in it is limited. All I know that, backend is everything that is working behind your website or application. Everything from fetching your data from the server to inputting it to store to server to play a video, backend is a huge task, but highly satisfying too. You do need to know a little bit of front end so as to know how to actually display your work, but otherwise backend is mainly invisible, but essential. There are a thousand of videos on YouTube for the same. I have tried my hand in Django, which is also a great place to start with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full Stack Developer&lt;br&gt;
Wow! so you want to make a complete website yourself rather than employing a different developer for front end or backend, then this is your call. A full stack web developer is one who has expertise in both front and back end technologies. It is always good to know more, and full stack developer means a lot of opportunities. There are various technology stacks and you can chose among them, after ample research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I have not mentioned it exclusively above, you have to learn git and learn how to use GitHub, so that you can harness the power of version control and also contribute to open source. It is a wonderful field with a vibrant community, where everyone, from newbies to veterans, are accepted to contribute. You can also push the projects you make to GitHub, so that people can view it, and work on it if they like. Git is essential for developers, so try to learn it ASAP, obviously, while developing projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list is not obviously over. There are domains like application development (android or iOS) which also has a lot of scope. The benefit of learning development is to get into start-ups and product companies, which usually don't care about your algorithms, but rather your experience. So that brings me to the next point,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Because learning is not enough. Your resume, needs to be attractive, to differentiate yourself from others. In today's world, Certificates of completion of a course has very less value. It will give the interviewer an idea that you know about such technology, but not how much. The how much comes from working on projects. These are the most important aspects of a techie's journey, to have a project. Many better than one. A project proves that you have done something in the respective technology. Even if you have no original idea, do something generic. &lt;br&gt;
[&lt;a href="https://workshops.hackclub.com/"&gt;https://workshops.hackclub.com/&lt;/a&gt;] here is a list of projects you can start from. &lt;br&gt;
As you do, so you reap. The more you do projects, the more you get to know about the language. Soon you will be able to think of an original idea. And by that time, you will be capable enough to make it from scratch. But till then, work.&lt;br&gt;
There are numerous tutorials on YouTube to start with one along with your studies of these technologies. After deciding what you like, start doing it. Trust me, the gratification of completing a project is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than projects, one important thing is to have an internship. If you are anything like me, finding an internship is hard. Which is why you always have to sharp in terms of time taken to apply, and your resume should be perfect. Since you are a newbie and your resume has nothing, DO PROJECTS. They attract the interviewer, and they might hire you. From an internship, you get unparalleled industry experience before getting a job. This will make you even more suited for a full time job, because you already have some experience in the industry. It is fine if you have no prior experience, apply to 50 internships, and you will surely get at least one. When you get one experience, it adds up with others to increase your chances to getting better and better internships. Never miss an opportunity, apply to Google, Facebook, Amazon even if you have no hope. Better try and fail that regret not trying at all. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed? Don't be. Because you don't have to do it alone. There are many many tech communities having people who are experts in what they do, to people like us. Join one, or two, or all, and try to contact them if you ever feel stuck. The thing about developers is that they are very happy to help, and are always ready to ask clarify your doubts. You don't have to do all this alone, since in a community, you can find people like you, collaborate, and do something together. You can ask around your college, google search, join some discord community, and voila, you are never alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yes, an essential skill, and probably the only one you need to start off, is to, yes, GOOGLE. Try to google everything when you are stuck. Most times, stack-overflow will be there to save you. When not, some other forum. But in the end, you have to try your best to extract the cause of error from google. And only then ask a developer. Because most times, they are also googling their errors :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet is your weapon. Everything is available on internet. If you are overwhelmed by the amount of resources, start with freeCodeCamp. It is a good place to start with, the generous people there are constantly giving knowledge for free. I also bought a course on Udemy by Angela Yu, called Web development bootcamp, to learn full stack web development. It was also worth it so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have said a lot now. There are a lot more that I want to say. These things are probably what you have already heard from a lot of places. But I feel like it is my duty to guide my dear freshmen and newbies to help them not repeat the mistakes I did. I am obviously not a better developer than you are, but I guess at this point of time, I just learnt what not to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best, and thanks for reading till the end :)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Early Years
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology was something I was interested in since a very young age. At first, I was mainly interested in electronics and robotics. I didn't make anything at the age of 5 or 6 but I would play around with whatever I would find at home. Then, I started getting interested in cars at the age of 7 and used to keep up with the latest news. This was also the time I started getting interested in gadgets likes phones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lego"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lego
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interested in playing with Lego from a very young age and every time I got a new set, I would try to make as many models as possible from that. I got a Lego Mindstorm (it is a robot that can be programmed) and many models can be built out of it. I would be making a new model every week and spending a lot of time doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starting with coding
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about 9 or 10 when I started some real coding. I started working with some Arduino stuff and then learned the C programming language. I learned Java when I was 11 and started some Android Development but I lost interest in it after some time. I didn't do much for the next one year. Then I started working on an Arduino project and then another but didn't succeed with any of them. I started learning Python a few months later and then started working on some small projects. I also tried to learn machine learning but realized that I needed to learn more maths to understand the theory behind all the algorithms and things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#youtube"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  YouTube
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to watch a lot of tech YouTubers upload content on YouTube and I was fascinated by it. I decided to make my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY-rVWTIsN-G7s81C89SzkA"&gt;own channel&lt;/a&gt; last year and started uploading a lot of videos. Now I have over 450 subscribers and over 90000 views. I haven't uploaded there for a while but I plan on getting my channel out of the grave with development-related videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Development
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning Javascript earlier this year and then learned React. Next, I learn NextJS and then made my first proper application, &lt;a href="https://easycomments.anishde.dev/"&gt;EasyComments&lt;/a&gt;, as a part of the &lt;a href="https://townhall.hashnode.com/auth0-hackathon"&gt;Hashnode x Auth0 Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; which was conducted back in August. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my journey into development so far and I aim to learn more, build more applications and contribute to open-source.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Take notes on the web with their context</title>
      <author>Jim Chan</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 09:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/betterrunner/take-notes-on-the-web-with-their-context-38j5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/betterrunner/take-notes-on-the-web-with-their-context-38j5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have developed a free open source chrome extension named &lt;a href="https://github.com/betterRunner/context-note"&gt;context-note&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to provide a better way to take, search and review notes on the web.&lt;br&gt;
Imaging we are browsing some websites and come across important information that we want to markdown, what would we do?&lt;br&gt;
We might properly copy the text and paste it to a cloud note-taking app (Evernote, Onenote, etc.) just like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VcVsLaMp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bd6sx7y3o6yki3amnk5y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VcVsLaMp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bd6sx7y3o6yki3amnk5y.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Several shortcomings comes into my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It could be &lt;strong&gt;cumbersome&lt;/strong&gt; and time-consuming: at least four operations (c&amp;amp;p the text, c&amp;amp;p the website link, write the note, c&amp;amp;p the image) need to be done to finish this single note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Loss of context details&lt;/strong&gt;: when reviewing this note, you can only read the sentence and image instead of the whole page, useless you open the link and scroll to the exact place where you have token this note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, another more easy method is simply clicking star ⭐ of the browser to throw the website link into the bookmark. As you can imagine, &lt;strong&gt;without the content and note information&lt;/strong&gt;, you basically can not remember why you marked down this link someday after two months.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So I think a more efficient tool should be used during taking notes on the web, especially when you are reading articles or learning something new. That is why I built context-note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZcakhGp_-HQ"&gt;https://youtu.be/ZcakhGp_-HQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a chrome extension with three key fetarues:&lt;br&gt;
📝 &lt;strong&gt;Notebook&lt;/strong&gt;, where text content, note itself and context information would be stored.&lt;br&gt;
🏷️ &lt;strong&gt;Tagbook&lt;/strong&gt;, manage the notes neatly with a handy tag system.&lt;br&gt;
⌨️ &lt;strong&gt;Rich text editor&lt;/strong&gt;: embed quill as the rich text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking notes with their context, I believe it would be a better way to &lt;strong&gt;store and review things that really matter to us&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS code&lt;/a&gt; has become so feature-rich in built-in settings, you should always double check if you really need the extension you have in mind: &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/robole" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wt3nseC2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CSYlAzie--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/361098/c72054fa-7e10-4e56-8abe-40906f536dfb.png" alt="robole"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/robole/vs-code-you-don-t-need-that-extension-18d7" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;VS Code: You don't need that extension&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Rob OLeary ・ Aug 5 '20 ・ 7 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#webdev&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#vscode&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#productivity&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#tips&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have also witnessed the features of many great extensions being baked in, like &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the best extensions I use to increase productivity include: &lt;a href="https://www.tabnine.com/"&gt;TabNine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode"&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer"&gt;Bracket Pair Colorizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Auth Firebase</title>
      <author>fireninja333</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 08:58:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fireninja333/google-auth-firebase-356c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fireninja333/google-auth-firebase-356c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog I am going to cover some basic concepts about the Firebase Authentication with google-auth. So lets zoom in and write some code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off all lets create a login and dashboard screen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QYbhrzLQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8jyvegvdyke1b97a3kwf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QYbhrzLQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8jyvegvdyke1b97a3kwf.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here in login screen div we have a button and then when we click on that button a pop up window will open and after selecting/creating/logging in with our google account it will redirect to our dashboard and show us our profile details like profile-picture, email and username. We will display it using the innerhtml method. Now lets create a firebase project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qhgiym19--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3h7091miv2idx8ecql8j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qhgiym19--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3h7091miv2idx8ecql8j.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n8iFsSaC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6gcl30q7wjugdn0p0x34.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n8iFsSaC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6gcl30q7wjugdn0p0x34.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After creating it lets create a web app&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rx5tY_oF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mlgp9gp6qalq11ejvag5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rx5tY_oF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mlgp9gp6qalq11ejvag5.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nRdKa0Ad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07gaftp4xmkonrkef8ga.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nRdKa0Ad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07gaftp4xmkonrkef8ga.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Give it a name and click next.&lt;br&gt;
Now lets enable Authentication and authentication with google &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bKwlzzxp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4fdho9b4eodt5vw58nng.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bKwlzzxp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4fdho9b4eodt5vw58nng.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTiYRQpo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ixsrfogvtojnco9trw9o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tTiYRQpo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ixsrfogvtojnco9trw9o.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Next: lets import authentication and our app&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.2.7/firebase-app.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.2.7/firebase-auth.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets create a javascript file and paste our config. You can find your config in project settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lOZS74qa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8w5o6mgz60zqgnul5xy8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lOZS74qa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8w5o6mgz60zqgnul5xy8.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we will get the elements from the html file and add a event listener to render the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UF16gtb0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hc41tdqchwg9riiz1wv3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UF16gtb0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hc41tdqchwg9riiz1wv3.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following: We will render the google sign in with pop up and tell it to show the user details and if there is a error just show it in the console.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NMviC0hr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jf6j8a0gnsniiw027lof.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NMviC0hr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jf6j8a0gnsniiw027lof.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now we will show the user details from the console to innerhtml&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UWuJ2SoP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ujjqd4oikh2wag0y7ssp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UWuJ2SoP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ujjqd4oikh2wag0y7ssp.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b4haYnkJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hglkvandymetb43hc8be.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b4haYnkJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hglkvandymetb43hc8be.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the above picture we are telling it to see for login's and if there is a login from the device then render the &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  showUserDetails  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;function or else let the user login. &lt;br&gt;
Finally lets give some functionality to the logout button.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AKaXsogE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3cz3werw6xgdwubvie1n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AKaXsogE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3cz3werw6xgdwubvie1n.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here the logout button will render the LogoutUser function and tell it to log out using &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  firebase.auth().signOut()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then after logging out just show the LoginScreen and if there is a error just display it in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like this blog consider following me on github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/fireninja333"&gt;https://github.com/fireninja333&lt;/a&gt; and you can find the source code: &lt;a href="https://github.com/fireninja333/google-auth-blog"&gt;https://github.com/fireninja333/google-auth-blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you! For reading and I will see you in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
