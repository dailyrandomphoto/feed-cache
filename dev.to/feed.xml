      <title>Publishing My First NPM Package</title>
      <author>Leyang Yu</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 03:25:05 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/lyu4321/publishing-my-first-npm-package-5g7e</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I published my first package, &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jellybean"&gt;jellybean&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;! I actually published the package back when I first created the repository in September, just to experiment. However, it didn't work back then and I kind of forgot about it after that. This week, I fixed up the issues I was having and now it works. 😊 In this post, I'll be explaining the process of how I published the package and fixed the issues I previously encountered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparing-a-project-to-be-published"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparing a Project to be Published
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to publish my program to &lt;a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; since it's the most common package manager for JavaScript programs. There are a few steps I followed in order to prepare the program to be published. First, in the package.json file, I added main and bin parameters. In addition, you need to have name and version parameters as well. For example, here is a snippet from my package.json file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"jellybean"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"1.0.10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"description"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"From one small program, you can create an entire website. Jellybean is a static site generator created in Node.js that lets you easily convert your text/markdown files into HTML."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"src/index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"bin"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"jellybean"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"src/index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Name and version are pretty self-explanatory, but main specifies the main entry point into the program and bin specifies the command to run the associated executable file. In this case, when a user runs the command "jellybean" after installing the package, the file "src/index.js" will be executed. In addition, each time I published to npm, I incremented the &lt;a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning#incrementing-semantic-versions-in-published-packages"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; and if you forget to do so, you will receive an error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I added the line:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env node
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To the top of the file to be executed ("src/index.js" in this case), which specifies that the program should be run in a node environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing the Project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before publishing to npm, I tested the program by running:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm link
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From within the same directory as the repository. Then I ran the program as if it had already been published (eg. running &lt;code&gt;jellybean --version&lt;/code&gt; would print the version number, etc.). You can read more about how to use npm link &lt;a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publishing-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publishing the Project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I published the program by running the commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm adduser
npm publish
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm adduser&lt;/code&gt; creates or links to your npm account. &lt;code&gt;npm publish&lt;/code&gt; publishes your package, which you should run each time you want to update your package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problems-i-encountered"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problems I Encountered
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the steps described above are quite simple, I encountered some problems along the way. Because I originally published the package in September and installed it, I had an older version of the jellybean files in my C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\npm folder. Therefore, every time I tried to run the jellybean command, I got the following error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; : The term '/user/bin/env.exe' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check
the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I fixed this issue by deleting the old files from the npm folder and once I published my package to npm, I reinstalled it globally and was able to successfully run the program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I partnered with another student from my class, &lt;a href="https://github.com/suhhee1011"&gt;Suhhee&lt;/a&gt;, in order to test each other's programs. When Suhhee tested my program, she received the following error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'src/layout.html'
    at Object.openSync (fs.js:498:3)
    at Object.readFileSync (fs.js:394:35)
    at getHtmlLayout 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I changed my file paths from relative to absolute paths using path.resolve() so that the program can be run from any directory. For example instead of:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src/index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;utf8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I updated the code to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFileSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../src/layout.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;utf8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the process of setting up an npm package was pretty straightforward, other than a few problems that I was able to resolve. Over the past almost three months, I've been working on this project every week and getting to publish it was a great end to this journey. If you're interested in trying out the program, you can read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jellybean"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g jellybean
jellybean --help
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get started. Thanks so much for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Wish I Knew Before I Became A Data Engineer</title>
      <author>SeattleDataGuy</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 03:07:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-became-a-data-engineer-5aip</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-became-a-data-engineer-5aip</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@guitarist321?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Chris Ainsworth&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2022 approaches, Data Engineering is primed to be one of the most important and fastest-growing fields of work. According to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernhardschroeder/2021/06/11/the-data-analytics-profession-and-employment-is-exploding-three-trends-that-matter/?sh=33456e3b3f81"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, data scientists, machine learning engineers, and big data engineers are three of the top trending professions on Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is further backed by survey's done by I&lt;a href="https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/are-companies-hiring-fewer-data-scientists"&gt;nterviewQuery that survived 10,000 data science&lt;/a&gt; and engineering roles and found that data engineering interviews were on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is causing people to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I become a data engineer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better help those who are thinking about taking on a career in data engineering, I wanted to reflect upon my own career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are things I wish I knew prior to starting my career as a data engineer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could I have better approached some of my earlier years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are questions I hope to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five things that I wish I knew before beginning my career in data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-dont-get-distracted-by-the-hype"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Don't Get Distracted by the Hype.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wish I had known when beginning my data engineering journey was not to get distracted by the hype!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With endless software being created seemingly every day, it is essential that you understand that mastering your fundamental&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgSHaOvNodA"&gt; data engineering skills&lt;/a&gt; and core frameworks is more important than getting caught up in the latest and greatest tech product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed some of these core concepts in &lt;a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/data-engineering-roadmap-for-2021-12-steps-to-help-you-go-from-0-to-data-engineering/#page-content"&gt;my data engineering roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to summarize. Focus on learning skills like programing, SQL, basic data analysis and data modeling, data pipelines and&lt;a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/what-are-the-benefits-of-cloud-data-warehousing-and-why-you-should-migrate/"&gt; data warehousing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the main reasons why it is so important to focus on learning the fundamentals before using the "shiny" new software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The new tools are often trends and have a non-guaranteed lifespan. One of the issues with the latest software is there always seems to be that "next" shiny new tool right around the corner. If you do not fully grasp the core skills and move on to software that has a short life cycle, you can drastically set back the progress of your career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mastering the fundamentals will help you understand how to utilize new software best. If you start by first mastering the fundamental data processes, it will be easier to understand how new software can help you streamline your work. Many data engineers get stuck on some of the latest tools and do not efficiently utilize them because they do not fully grasp the fundamentals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Mastering fundamentals allow you to switch careers if you don't like data engineering. Although some roles like software engineering is different than data engineering. There is some cross over. Both roles require programming, understanding data structures as well as working with cloud components. If you really end up disliking data engineering, then you might be able to switch. Of course, this will depend how much code you write as a DE because if you're using low-code solutions, it might not be an easy switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2%C2%A0focus-on%C2%A0developing-maintainable-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Focus on Developing Maintainable Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning how to create maintainable code is one of the essential steps in becoming a data engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are new to the industry and want to create a complex system using a combination of skills from Python to Bash with a combination of any other coding tool, you are essentially creating software that only you can maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may be fine in the short term if you decide to move on with your career or other team members have to utilize your software, it will either have to be re-written or thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that when you create a project, it is simple for other data engineers to read and interpret for the project's longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-the-lie-that-is-source-of-truth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. The Lie That Is Source of Truth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A source of truth in the data world means that there is one canonical copy of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that any time changes are made, they will be tracked and documented, so everyone knows what has changed with each revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you can master this skill early on in your data engineering career. In that case, it will save you a lot of headache down the line when organizing datasets for different purposes or making sure that all stakeholders have access to an up-to-date version of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common mistake I see new data engineers make is not deciding how they want to manage their source of truth from day one. This often ends up causing them hours upon hours getting organized later on because they did not decide which tool best suited their needs from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something important to remember about the source of truth is that it is a moving target rather than a final destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-save-your-sql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Save Your SQL
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL has a lot of complex business logic that can be very challenging to remember if you make even the slightest change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I began my career as a data engineer and did not know this significant fact about saving my queries from the beginning, I spent hours fixing datasets because they were suddenly not functioning how I wanted them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that every time you create a dataset, it is saved in its current state, so if something breaks or needs to be changed, later on, you do not have to recreate the entire thing from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering your initial queries is not realistic. Use version control, so you do not have to remember your exact queries. There are a lot of different options in how you could approach this. You could create a repository for your analytical teams in Github or utilize tools like dbt that help you &lt;a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/best-practices"&gt;utilize best practices like dev and prod as well as version control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-saying-yes-to-every-request-is-not-the-answer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Saying Yes to Every Request Is Not The Answer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widespread problem that many data engineers face is saying yes to every request! Ok, let's be real, this is a wide-spread issue of most people regardless of career choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't change it's importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you want to help as many people as possible, but the reality of the matter is that your time is valuable, and even the smallest tasks can be very time-consuming. I have had tasks as simple as adding a column turning into a 2-month project because a Python 3 migration was required before I could even add a column(Don't ask).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something helpful to do before agreeing to a task is first to analyze the level of importance that the task may have. If you decide that the task is of low importance, you may want to consider declining the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, consider how much work you already have on your plate. Even if you have a high-priority task come across your desk, you can't manifest new time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you're already low on how much work you can take on, make sure the current requesting party as well as possibly your manager knows your current constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can reassess and reprioritize what needs to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not only save you time but ensure that your team is aware of what projects are more important than others, and they can prioritize accordingly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data engineering can be a very rewarding profession, and it is increasing in demand and importance with the data-driven world that we now live in. However, there are many things that you must be aware of before starting your data engineering career!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on your core skills, developing maintainable software, understanding the source of truth, saving your SQL, and learning how to say no are some of the most important lessons I have learned over my career as a data engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone has had a great holiday so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my mentors really liked the phrase "Your code will haunt you" and I thought it was really memorable. It was kind of a mantra to make sure the code you were writing was code you wanted to look at and maintain. I have been tying things together in this project with toothpicks and hot glue, and it's really starting to feel messy. My code is indeed starting to haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State in my project has turned into a giant web of mistakes. Now that I have learned so much, I feel it might be faster to start over from the very beginning than to continue working on my mistakes, but I will bear through. I'm considering drawing out the state I have so far so I can get a better visual to try and fix it. I have learned a lot, but I still need to test a couple things to really be sure I understand some of the nuances of state inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was spent trying to fix broken things by (unfortunately) breaking them further. I really got lost in the weeds today and I'm hoping tomorrow has a better solution in store for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once again want to apologize, I will not be sharing details of the struggles in my group project. That is taking up nearly all of my time at the moment, and a portion of the remaining time is being spent on studying for finals. The spare time I am spending on my #100daysofcode challenge is currently being spent on tutorials and reading more about Django! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dove straight into school project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked through the rest of the FreeCodeCamp Regex tutorials (yay!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a bit about Django, (started this series! &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mblayman/from-browser-to-django-j0l"&gt;Understand Django&lt;/a&gt; by Matt Layman. Very well written, I really recommend it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#upcoming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Upcoming
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Finals and final project sprints&lt;/strong&gt;: Not much time left!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue reading about Django, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iron out details regarding the Study Aid app (I really need to name this thing) -- May work on this this weekend

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flask vs Django - This is still an ongoing discussion. I received some good advice to stick with what I know in Flask, however I am still considering diving into Django, as I will have free time soon. Diving in headfirst has always been my favorite way to learn, however it is often not efficient!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I change how I deploy? Should Docker get in the picture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any other systems I should think about using as a part of this project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn more about Material UI, I will probably use Material UI a little bit in my (ongoing) school project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the Study Aid app!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later in the challenge: AWS Deployment, AWS Certification, and Using Docker!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great, long weekend everybody, stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

      <title>How I structure my React.js projects</title>
      <author>Jaakko</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 01:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bjakyt/how-i-structure-my-reactjs-projects-4cmc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bjakyt/how-i-structure-my-reactjs-projects-4cmc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Structuring React applications into files and folders is an opinionated topic, because there is no right or wrong way to do it. I decided to share how I have structured my projects lately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Highly opinionated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#single-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Single file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React projects usually start with an &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; folder and one &lt;code&gt;src/App.tsx&lt;/code&gt; file with an App component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GGuAk12M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ej5es5a20cdybqrn7ngj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GGuAk12M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ej5es5a20cdybqrn7ngj.png" alt="1" width="880" height="958"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, your app has more features, more lines, and you will need to make smaller standalone components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KR92HM-o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/forl9qz4dcqawmteaz3v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KR92HM-o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/forl9qz4dcqawmteaz3v.png" alt="2" width="880" height="1757"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's OK to have multiple components in one file, especially if those components are tightly coupled to the main component. Often it's better to use multiple files because eventually, that one file is not sufficient anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multiple-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multiple files
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having all our code in one file, we can split these components into multiple files. At this point, as our project is still quite small, I would do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KIge0vVN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tpc5jl5y2b6f6d2b91s4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KIge0vVN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tpc5jl5y2b6f6d2b91s4.png" alt="3" width="880" height="538"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, List component exports only &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;, but it also has the &lt;code&gt;ListItem&lt;/code&gt; component, which is not exported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to take it to the next level, you can start using directories instead of files. I would also extract the &lt;code&gt;ListItem&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; and make it its own standalone component inside &lt;code&gt;src/components/List/partials&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUF4L19X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88h4a8te8e7ximsgjpdm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUF4L19X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88h4a8te8e7ximsgjpdm.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="653"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, I would only use &lt;code&gt;/components&lt;/code&gt; directory for reusable components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#folder-separation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Folder separation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we separate features from components. Let's say we need to create an &lt;code&gt;useUser&lt;/code&gt; hook, so we'll create a dedicated &lt;code&gt;hooks&lt;/code&gt; directory and put it in there: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XFQS1exa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x86dawzg1zgtk6b63h5d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XFQS1exa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x86dawzg1zgtk6b63h5d.png" alt="4" width="880" height="729"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;hooks&lt;/code&gt; folder is meant for reusable hooks only. If you have a hook that is used by one component only, it should remain in the component's own file (or directory). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same principle applies to many other things as well. For example, if we need to create a reusable service - we'll create a &lt;code&gt;services&lt;/code&gt; directory and put our service in there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P11moDXY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6t2prz9s1274xpof6zsz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P11moDXY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6t2prz9s1274xpof6zsz.png" alt="5" width="880" height="806"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#separated-views"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Separated views
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we create separate directories for everything that's reusable and keep the non-reusable stuff only where it is used, we've come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I want to create a directory called &lt;code&gt;views&lt;/code&gt;. Those views are basically a representation of the url. For example, a directory &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; could mean &lt;code&gt;https://&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;/user&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These views can of course import reusable services or components, but they also have their own subdirectories for non-reusable stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example, how my project structure could look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gvk1ah2J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/klbc1mn1cty4nrfvwhln.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gvk1ah2J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/klbc1mn1cty4nrfvwhln.png" alt="6" width="880" height="924"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changelog #0003 — 📦 HTTPie command generation</title>
      <author>Cláudia Delgado</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 01:30:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pie/changelog-0003-httpie-command-generation-231f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pie/changelog-0003-httpie-command-generation-231f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friday! It's the time to let you know what have we been up to. Check out what's new this week 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpie-for-web-amp-desktop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTTPie for Web &amp;amp; Desktop
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission to provide the best experience to anyone working with APIs continues at full speed. We've reached feature parity with the &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/cli"&gt;terminal version&lt;/a&gt;, launched in a &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/beta"&gt;private beta&lt;/a&gt;, added &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/blog/changelog-0001"&gt;light theme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/blog/changelog-0002"&gt;tabs&lt;/a&gt;, persistency, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are focusing on a couple of Big Things™. In the meantime, here’s a few goodies across the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#export-requests-to-httpie-for-terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📦 Export requests to HTTPie for Terminal
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTPie for Terminal is still our most beloved child, and we want it to go hand in hand with Web &amp;amp; Desktop. This is the first step in that direction: you can now generate HTTPie commands in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the preview and select the HTTPie option. Check the generated command and copy it to your terminal or share it with a CLI-first colleague. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resize-panels"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ↔️ Resize panels
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTPie aims to be perfectly tailored to your API requests &amp;amp; responses. We try our best, but you'll always know better. The ultimate power is now yours: you can resize panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose your preferred panel's width by clicking and dragging the panel dividers to make them wider or narrower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reorder-tabs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔀 Re-order tabs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use tabs for organization, you'll probably find this a great addition to our last tabs update. Now you can drag and drop each tab and place them in your preferred order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨ Improvements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to recall when you sent that request? Now you don't need to remember. Check out the timestamp near the  time and size info, at the bottom of the response panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of that area: when you hover the response size info, you now get more granular time &amp;amp; size stats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduced orange color for recoverable errors (e.g., invalid JSON in the editor). Red is now used exclusively for blocking issues, and orange is for all others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tab names now omit common URL prefixes like &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;www.&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fixes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🪲 Fixes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Response headers were a bit mixed up with proxy headers, autch! We fixed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#httpie-for-terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTTPie for Terminal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are improvements in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie"&gt;development version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/cli"&gt;HTTPie for Terminal&lt;/a&gt; as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plugins-management-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔌 Plugins management command
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTPie for Terminal offers extensibility through plugins, and there are over 100+ of them available to try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They add things like new authentication methods (&lt;a href="https://github.com/akamai/httpie-edgegrid"&gt;akamai/httpie-edgegrid&lt;/a&gt;), transport mechanisms (&lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie-unixsocket"&gt;httpie/httpie-unixsocket&lt;/a&gt;), message convertors (&lt;a href="https://github.com/banteg/httpie-image"&gt;banteg/httpie-image&lt;/a&gt;), or simply change how a response is formatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve added a new command, &lt;code&gt;httpie plugins&lt;/code&gt;, to help you manage (&lt;code&gt;install&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;uninstall&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;) plugins. It also solves a long-standing plugins-related issue with non-&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; installations (e.g., via Homebrew) and it's a potential place for many new features to come. (&lt;a href="https://github.com/httpie/httpie/pull/1200"&gt;#1200&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#happy-testing-and-see-you-next-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Happy testing, and see you next week!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💁🏻‍♀️ If you’re not on the private beta yet, you can &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/beta"&gt;join the waitlist here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👉 You can also follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/httpie"&gt;@httpie&lt;/a&gt; and join our &lt;a href="https://httpie.io/discord"&gt;Discord community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>DGraph Data Modeling: Part 1 - Timestamps</title>
      <author>Jonathan Gamble</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:30:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jdgamble555/dgraph-data-modeling-part-1-timestamps-5fp0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jdgamble555/dgraph-data-modeling-part-1-timestamps-5fp0</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-dgraph"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is DGraph?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, &lt;a href="https://dgraph.io/"&gt;DGraph&lt;/a&gt; is the best competition to Firestore there is (and much much more). Imagine Firestore with Subscriptions, plus a Graph Database for complex searching, plus any kind of relational data you can think of, wrapped in a GraphQL interface, or a backend custom language called DQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#timestamps-huh"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Timestamps huh?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While DGraph is new and they team works on getting every feature we can think of implemented, Timestamps seems to be one of the most requested features. There is an active &lt;a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/pull/8017"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; on github for this feature (dpeek, seriously thank you for your hard work--also anytime the Dgraph team works on GraphQL Features, thank you guys too!), the feature is not quite available for the public. Once approved, it will be available to non-cloud users immediately (or now if they want to add use a custom backend), and to cloud users hopefully in the next 0 days to 6 months. At that point, I will update this posts, as it will still contain valuable information for some users. It is also good to know that the forementioned feature request will not protect the user from updating their own timestamps (which you don't want), until the &lt;a href="https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/feature-request-update-after-auth-validation/14799"&gt;update after @auth&lt;/a&gt; feature is added. This method will protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#okay-so-what-can-i-do-about-it-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Okay, so what can I do about it now!?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That my friends, is why I wrote this post. You can get your precious timestamps now, if you just model your data a certain way and add a little backend code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, you can just create a &lt;a href="https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/lambda/mutation/"&gt;custom mutation&lt;/a&gt;, which is DGraph's official work around, but then you have to lock all adds and updates on your schema, which is not a good thing. That being said, custom mutations can pretty much solve any problem if you want to just do all mutations with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DGraph currently does not support pre-mutation triggers (hooks), but they do support post-mutation hooks. I have thought about this for a while, as the model is not intuitive until you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-on-with-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get on with it...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here is the setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;schema.graphql&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;createdAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updatedAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTime&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice there are no required ! symbols on any item related to the timestamps. This is because everything is done in the lambda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice there is no @hasInverse on anything related to timestamps. This is because everything is handled internally. On a GraphQL delete, one of the two connections will be deleted. The lambda needs the other connection to find the timestamp node to delete it. If you don't understand this, don't worry, just don't use hasInverse on any node related to timestamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to create a new node &lt;code&gt;Timestamp&lt;/code&gt; in order to secure it from bad programming or pirate users. Once either the &lt;a href="https://discuss.dgraph.io/t/feature-request-update-after-auth-validation/14799"&gt;update after @auth&lt;/a&gt; is implemented next year, or another feature that adds field level auth, this will not be needed. I will talk more about circumventing this problem in future posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lambdas.ts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateTimestamps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dql&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addWebHookResolvers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Post.add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateTimestamps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Post.update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateTimestamps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Post.delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateTimestamps&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this code is that it can be reused on any node, and you can even use the function within another function if you need to run other post-hook tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write everything in typescript as I believe pure javascript is evil. 😈😡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply run &lt;code&gt;tsc lambdas.ts&lt;/code&gt; in your typescript enabled framework (which you should be using) and copy the lambda.js file contents it creates into your lambda text-box on DGraph cloud, or wherever. You can also automate this with the &lt;a href="https://dgraph.io/docs/cloud/cloud-api/lambda/"&gt;Dgraph Cloud API&lt;/a&gt;, but that is for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only use this on a new database, as it will not automatically create timestamps on old data (this should be obvious, but just adding it in case you can't quite wrap your brain around it yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the moment &lt;a href="https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/lambda/webhook/"&gt;lambda webhooks&lt;/a&gt; do not run on nested updates, so you if you want this to work for those cases, you will have to also add a webhook on the parent object's add, update, and delete methods, if and only if there is new data coming in on this node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This method &lt;strong&gt;DOES&lt;/strong&gt; automatically add, update, and delete timestamps for all other cases. Let me know if you see any bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must keep the inverse nodes (ex: Timestamp.post) as &lt;strong&gt;the same name&lt;/strong&gt; as the main node, but lowercase. This is how it automatically knows how to find the node. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all your regular @auth stuff to the parent nodes, as the NEVER auth will prevent them from touching the timestamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user with the custom claim &lt;code&gt;{ NEVER: 'ALWAYS' }&lt;/code&gt; could technically pierce this @auth, so don't add that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up -- following the same pattern -- @cascade Delete --- Coming Soon...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; drive is running out of space, we can move our &lt;strong&gt;WSL2&lt;/strong&gt; file system to another drive in a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are using an user different than root, we need to know it, running the &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; command (WSL side):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sVw-OEun--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/03sz2lk06bx7clveee03.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sVw-OEun--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/03sz2lk06bx7clveee03.png" alt="who am I" width="880" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we need to know the distro name and WSL version, running the &lt;code&gt;wsl --list --verbose&lt;/code&gt; command on PowerShell (Windows Side):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MQuBrBWJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9msg5nr4n46iva9rer02.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MQuBrBWJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9msg5nr4n46iva9rer02.png" alt="WSL list" width="880" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing the &lt;strong&gt;username:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;equiman&lt;/code&gt;, the linux &lt;strong&gt;distribution:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt;, and confirm that we are using the &lt;code&gt;WSL 2&lt;/code&gt; version, we are ready to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JoRXazFc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9luo23t87clkxk1wzhpx.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JoRXazFc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9luo23t87clkxk1wzhpx.gif" alt="moving day" width="501" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#move"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Move
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All next steep need to be done on PowerShell (Windows Side).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to shutdown WSL to avoid data corruption. Close all WSL terminals that are using it and then run the &lt;code&gt;wsl --shutdown&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we are going to create a backup from our &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; linux distribution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;D:&lt;span class="se"&gt;\b&lt;/span&gt;ackup
wsl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--export&lt;/span&gt; Ubuntu D:&lt;span class="se"&gt;\b&lt;/span&gt;ackup&lt;span class="se"&gt;\u&lt;/span&gt;buntu.tar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don't worry if you not see progress indicators. This can be take a while depending how much data you have. Maybe it's good idea take a rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2i-cHxjE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpzhpd362f1tokfvrxrx.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2i-cHxjE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vpzhpd362f1tokfvrxrx.gif" alt="waiting" width="640" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When finish, we need to to unregister the linux distribution from &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; drive. It will also release the disk space.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wsl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--unregister&lt;/span&gt; Ubuntu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, import again on our new disk. I'll use &lt;code&gt;D:&lt;/code&gt; disk as an example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;D:&lt;span class="se"&gt;\W&lt;/span&gt;SL
wsl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--import&lt;/span&gt; Ubuntu D:&lt;span class="se"&gt;\W&lt;/span&gt;SL&lt;span class="se"&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;D:&lt;span class="se"&gt;\b&lt;/span&gt;ackup&lt;span class="se"&gt;\u&lt;/span&gt;buntu.tar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default Ubuntu will use root as default user, to switch to our user (&lt;code&gt;equiman&lt;/code&gt; in my case) we need to run this commands.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$env&lt;/span&gt;:USERPROFILE&lt;span class="se"&gt;\A&lt;/span&gt;ppData&lt;span class="se"&gt;\L&lt;/span&gt;ocal&lt;span class="se"&gt;\M&lt;/span&gt;icrosoft&lt;span class="se"&gt;\W&lt;/span&gt;indowsApps
ubuntu config &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--default-user&lt;/span&gt; equiman
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure replacing &lt;code&gt;equiman&lt;/code&gt; with yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restart WSL running &lt;code&gt;wsl&lt;/code&gt; command and it's done.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s All Folks!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/strong&gt; 🖖&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2 Ways to Implement Binding Adapters</title>
      <author>Vincent T</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 22:32:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vtsen/2-ways-to-implement-binding-adapters-4omc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vtsen/2-ways-to-implement-binding-adapters-4omc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One way is using function parameter and another way is using extension function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be more than 2 ways to implement binding adapters, but this is what I know. Let's look at what binding adapters are first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-binding-adapters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Binding Adapters?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binding adapter is used for &lt;strong&gt;implementing custom attribute&lt;/strong&gt; in your layout file. For example, instead of using the default&lt;code&gt;android:text&lt;/code&gt; attribute, you want to customize it by creating a new attribute &lt;code&gt;app:customText&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#default-attribute-raw-androidtext-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Default Attribute - &lt;code&gt;android:text&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/textView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Hello World!"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#custom-attribute-raw-appcustomtext-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Custom Attribute - &lt;code&gt;app:customText&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/textView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:customText="@{`Hello World!`}"/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To implement custom attribute, we use binding adapters. Binding adapter is part of the data binding library. So you need to include the following in your &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; module file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        dataBinding true
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To implement a binding adapter, you need to annotate the function with &lt;code&gt;@BindingAdapter("attribute name here")&lt;/code&gt; together with &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; class that you want to bind to. It can be done by passing the &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; class (e.g. &lt;code&gt;TextView&lt;/code&gt;) as a function parameter or using the extension function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-pass-raw-view-endraw-as-function-parameter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.  Pass &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; as Function Parameter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if this is a standard way (or maybe a recommended way?) but this is in the official documentation. What I learned initially is the second method below (i.e. using the extension function)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@BindingAdapter("customText")
fun setCustomText(view:TextView, item: String) {
    view.text = "My Custom String: $item"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-use-raw-view-endraw-extension-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Use &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt; Extension Function
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@BindingAdapter("customText")
fun TextView.setCustomText(item: String) {
    text = "My Custom String: $item"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because this is an extension function, you can call it in code directly like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;binding.textView.setCustomText("Hello World!")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can do that with the first method too, but the second method is more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#personally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Personally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer the second method, use the extension function to implement binding adapter. It reflects the actual intention, which is to extend the&lt;code&gt;TextView&lt;/code&gt; functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Auto-fixable import sorting rules for ESLint</title>
      <author>Bartłomiej Stefański</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 22:29:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bmstefanski/auto-fixable-import-sorting-rules-for-eslint-laj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bmstefanski/auto-fixable-import-sorting-rules-for-eslint-laj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pretty much standard way of sorting imports in JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd party imports first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then local default exports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then local exports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's the snippet that sorts them in this exact order and &lt;br&gt;
satisfies my needs completely!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt; eslint-plugin-import  

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# or    &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; eslint-plugin-import
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .eslintrc.js  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ignoredSortingDirectories&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.vscode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;node_modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// ... some other configurations  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... your rules  &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sort-imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ignoreCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ignoreDeclarationSort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}],&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;import/order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  
      &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;   
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;groups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;builtin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sibling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;pathGroups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDirectoriesToSort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;singleDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;singleDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/**`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})),&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;public/**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;alphabetize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;asc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;caseInsensitive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;  
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... your rules  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDirectoriesToSort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDirectories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ignoredSortingDirectories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDirectories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readdirSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;statSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Four tips for staying motivated while learning</title>
      <author>Zach Snoek</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/zachsnoek/four-tips-for-staying-motivated-while-learning-473e</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is a field that is regularly changing. Thus, developers must be continual learners to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, motivating yourself to learn and creating a lasting habit can be difficult, especially if you're self-studying outside of school or work.  Below are four techniques that I use to stay motivated while learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quick-reference"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quick reference
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spice it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the end goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-set-deadlines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Set deadlines
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning without structure can feel like an endless task with no end in sight; it's often nice to have a sense of progress. I've found that artificial deadlines give me something to work toward and cleanly mark progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of deadlines you could set for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will study Python for 30 minutes by the end of the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will complete one module of my online JavaScript course by Friday every week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will finish two projects by the end of the month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to create manageable deadlines; experiment until you find something right for you. You may want to try a large interval at first and narrow it down until you find the sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when I first started blogging, I wanted to publish bi-weekly. I quickly realized that writing and researching a quality post in two weeks wasn't possible for me, so I changed to a monthly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-gamify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Gamify
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlines aren't for everyone: you might have better luck incentivizing yourself through gamification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you could implement a basic point system in which you earn a point every day you study SQL. You can use 14 points to treat yourself to a small meal or pay yourself five dollars. Or, you could reward yourself some other way when you've done something five consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the most motivation from the &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626"&gt;Seinfeld method&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that every day you do something––learning in some way, in our case––you put a red X through the day on a calendar. The more days you add X's, the longer the chain of X's gets; your goal is to "not break the chain." This method is essentially point-earning and provides an incentive for showing up consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-spice-it-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Spice it up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found it helpful to vary how I study the material. I find that learning through one medium can be tiring after a while. Temporarily switching the medium motivates me to keep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I'm learning one topic, I find a preferred, primary medium for studying it––typically text. I'll then augment this material with other media such as YouTube videos and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I'm learning about prototypes in JavaScript, I'll spend most of my time reading Mozilla documentation or other articles. When I've absorbed that material, I'll watch various YouTube videos about prototypes and then try to write code and build something that uses them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-identify-the-end-goal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Identify the end goal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, learn with a clear goal in mind, and use this goal to remind yourself why you're learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are you learning? Maybe you're preparing for a career change that will boost your income. Or perhaps you're &lt;a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/"&gt;learning in public&lt;/a&gt; to help others and gain credibility. (Upward mobility has been a good impetus for me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind yourself of this goal frequently: write it down on a sticky note attached to your computer or set a reminder on your phone; whatever is visible to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, find a goal that motivates you when you're the most unmotivated. A resilient objective can carry you through the periods when you'd rather watch Netflix or stop learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these methods might not work for you, but hopefully, you've been able to pick up something helpful. Let me know in the comments if there's a motivation technique you use that I missed!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What to charge for your app and what’s the value of it?</title>
      <author>Appmaster.io</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 22:05:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appmaster_io/what-to-charge-for-your-app-and-whats-the-value-of-it-ak6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appmaster_io/what-to-charge-for-your-app-and-whats-the-value-of-it-ak6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all want to see a return on our investment, especially when creating applications, which require significant resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You spent money, your time, put in a lot of effort, and finally, your app is ready. Now comes the new challenge: what to charge for your app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision depends on many factors. The number of working hours, testing costs, marketing and promotion, purchase of any licenses are some aspects that define the overall cost of development. Calculate the costs first, then set the price for the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put an adequate price tag on your product, first, let's look at the different pricing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pros and cons of pricing models will help you choose the best option for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pricing-models"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pricing Models
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is essential to find the balance between the price that customers are ready to pay and the amount you are hoping to receive to cover production costs and costs of future maintenance. The pricing model you will be prepared to adapt will entirely depend on the nature of your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#free"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Free
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn't like getting things for free? Everybody does. Offering your app for free can be a good starting point. Lots of customers will be willing to try the app as long as it costs nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a working model for mobile apps. Because stores are full of options, people usually start looking for the solution from the "free" tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for making the app completely free is if you are not planning to generate profit directly from it, rather than use it as a booster for other revenue streaming platforms. For example, redirect users to a website where they can make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, you need to figure out additional ways to generate revenue. And a profitable way to do so — run in-app advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inapp-ads"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In-app ads
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running advertisements in the app generate ongoing revenue. You can implement many different formats for serving ads within your application: video ads, banners, pop-ups, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, you need to be very precise when picking the advertisement's format, periodicity, and subject. Otherways you may disrupt users with irrelevant, aggressive content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use online services, such as Google AdMob, for filtering and sorting in-app ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else can you do? Offer customers to make a one-time payment to turn off the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inapp-purchases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In-app purchases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bet you saw many examples of this model. According to this structure, a user can download an app for free, but it offers them some additional features for the money. If it's a game app, you can refill lives or unlock a photo filter in the editing app for an extra price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is generally the most using model as it doesn't have any noticeable flaws and allows users to access the significant app functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freemium"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Freemium
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term freemium comes from two words — free + premium. Like in-app purchases, it lets your customers download the app for free and then charges them for a premium feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can try several options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer two versions of the app&lt;/strong&gt; — free and premium with broadened functionality. After downloading a free version and testing it, users themselves can decide whether to upgrade to premium or the free set is enough for their needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Provide a free trial.&lt;/strong&gt; Set a limited free trial for your app, and once it expires, customers will have to pay to continue using the app.&lt;br&gt;
With the freemium model, your goal is to allure customers with the app's functionality and compel them to switch to the paid version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#potential-pitfalls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Potential pitfalls
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pricing model can cause a lot of work for developers as they will be required to provide continuous updates and improvements and manage two different apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#subscription"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Subscription
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscription is another good strategy to consider for your app. Everything is simple: users have to pay a monthly/annual fee to continue using the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a general approach for streaming platforms and music apps. We all have an active subscription to Spotify, Netflix, or Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you may not gain new users, you are still generating revenue from subscribed customers. Look at this as an opportunity to build loyal and long-lasting relationships with your customers. Keep in mind that you still have to provide updates and improvements, so you will not see a lot of subscription cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#paid"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Paid
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is the simplest pricing model. It requires customers to pay a one-time fee to download the app and freely use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, users can't get a feel for the app, and you ask them to pay you money right away. Your potential users need to understand that this app is worth purchasing. Use marketing to convince people that your application is one of the best to help them solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short description in the app store is not enough. Users will want to know as many details as possible to make a purchase decision. So give them this information, create visual content to show how everything works, launch a website, and use related platforms for the promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-the-value-of-your-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's the value of your app?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume you analyzed all the pricing models and picked the most appropriate one. Whichever option you are considering, you still have to put a price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the right decision, you have to consider many things. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purpose of your app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your business goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your target audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of building and maintaining the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your competitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where you are going to display the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, identify the value of your app. You and your team are the first people to understand the value of your product. Only with a clear idea, you make people believe that they will get something worthwhile in return after the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-identify-the-value-of-the-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to identify the value of the app?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, specify the problem your app solves: a dictionary translating verbal speech, an editor improving your photos, or a task tracker organizing your workday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, identify how it delivers the solution and is better than thousands of other similar apps. Your dictionary may have a higher translation speed; an editor provides a broader range of manual settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prove to your customers that if they pay for your dictionary, they will get a pocket translator providing instant service and keeping translations in separate text documents. So it can replace interpreters and reduce expenses that you most likely spend to pay for their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, try to be honest with your customers and respect their choice. You don't want to exceed their expectations. Built your relationships on trust, only this way you can earn loyalty and retention of your customers, which is key to ongoing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least — make a competitive analysis. Look at the rates of similar apps and analyze the market you are entering in. Again, you can follow some strategies. Get your advantage by undercutting competitors on the price. If your app is on the same level, selling it for a higher price won't do any good. However, if your app is more complex and advanced, you should charge more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many suggest when releasing your application to set a higher price and lower it over time. Be practical, and don't put more than average users will pay. If we are talking about mobile app stores, users expect the cost of the apps to be around 0.99 cents, if not free. And they hardly pay an amount more than $6.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering these facts, stores now contain more free apps, and paid ones continue to decrease. The best way to go, release a free app with in-app purchases. It gives you a field to be creative; you may include more options of purchasable features and service, providing customers with a choice: whether to pay or not, for what to spend money. If you decide to sell your app aside from the store, go with the subscription model. The pricing strategy should reflect the value of your app. A quality product will always find its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
