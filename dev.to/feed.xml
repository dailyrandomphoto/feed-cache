      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us have always been learning foreign languages for various reasons – travel and meeting new people, career and business, self-improvement and fun, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to succeed in learning a language is to start with it as a kid. The age of 5-12 is the most productive time for everyone, as your brain absorbs any information fast and retains it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you planning to create a language learning app that kids will love? Study the main aspects of such a startup before you contact the developers and discuss further details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistically, 80% of young Europeans (aged 15-30) speak at least one foreign language. Many of them have learned it or improved their school knowledge with different kinds of apps and websites. The main benefits of E-learning are availability at any time and place, convenience, and low prices. If you create an app like that, it can bring you a steady income – for instance, the global market of digital English learning solutions is the most profitable, with revenue estimated at over $4 billion in 2018 and predicted to reach $54.9 billion by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other popular apps for children and teenagers helping them learn foreign languages. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EASY peasy – an English learning app for kids aged 5-7 and older;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindsnacks – a series of language learning apps for kids and adults; it includes popular offers like Spanish and French alongside rarer options, e.g., Japanese;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lirica – a clever app for teens aged 12-13 and older; it helps learn world languages with the lyrics of pop hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is one of the most successful language learning apps for kids and adults. It has become world-famous and earned over $100 million for six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current market, you’ll find the following types of language learning apps and websites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital courses like Duolingo, Rosetta Stone (both have versions of their products to help kids learn foreign languages), Mondly Kids or FluentU;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashcards-based and other repetition apps like Drops, Anki App, or Quizlet;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-learning games like Gus Οn Τhe Go or Endless Spanish;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language learning video-based apps like Little Pim or LingoDeer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to create a language learning app for kids, prepare for a challenging job. You’ll need a well-thought conception, experienced authors of training materials, and a team of qualified app developers. Invest in professionals’ work to get an excellent end-product for the competitive E-learning market. We hope that our suggestions are helpful for creating a kids’ language learning app. Start with deciding what kind of solution to develop and how much to budget for it.

      <title>Knapsack Algorithm</title>
      <author>Santhosh Balasa</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:35:54 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/sbalasa/knapsack-algorithm-i0o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three types to implement a Knapsack Algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knapsack Recursive (Basic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knapsack Memoization (Cached)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knapsack TopDown (Optimized)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Knapsack Problem Recursive

def knapsack(w, v, W, n):
    if n == 0 or W == 0:
        return 0
    if w[n-1] &amp;lt;= W:
        return max(
            v[n-1] + knapsack(w, v, W-w[n-1], n-1), 
            knapsack(w, v, W, n-1)
        )
    else:
        return knapsack(w, v, W, n-1)

# Knapsack Problem Memoization

def knapsack_memoization(w, v, W, n):
    t = [[-1 for _ in range(W+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]  # Matrix n x W
    if n == 0 or W == 0:
        return 0
    if t[n][W] != -1:
        return t[n][W]
    if w[n-1] &amp;lt;= W:
        t[n][W] = max(
            v[n-1] + knapsack_memoization(w, v, W-w[n-1], n-1),
            knapsack_memoization(w, v, W, n-1)
        )
    else:
        t[n][W] = knapsack_memoization(w, v, W, n-1)
    return t[n][W]

# Knapsack Problem Top Down

def knapsack_top_down(w, v, W, n):
    t = [[-1 for _ in range(W+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] # Matrix n x W
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(W+1):
            if i == 0 or W == 0:
                t[i][j] = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, W+1):
            if w[i-1] &amp;lt;= j:
                t[i][j] = max(v[i-1] + t[i-1][j-w[i-1]], t[i-1][j])
            else:
                t[i][j] = t[i-1][j]
    return t[n][W]

# Input
w = [2, 3, 4, 5] # Weights
v = [3, 4, 5, 6] # Values 
W = 5 # Max Knapsack Capacity

# Output
print("Knapsack Recursive -&amp;gt; ", knapsack(w, v, W, len(w)))
print("Knapsack Memoization -&amp;gt; ", knapsack_memoization(w, v, W, len(w)))
print("Knapsack TopDown -&amp;gt; ", knapsack_top_down(w, v, W, len(w)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Resiliency: 5 Tips to Learning How to Code and Surviving Tech Boot Camps</title>
      <author>JC Smiley</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:12:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jcsmileyjr/resiliency-5-tips-to-learning-how-to-code-and-surviving-tech-boot-camps-25h6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jcsmileyjr/resiliency-5-tips-to-learning-how-to-code-and-surviving-tech-boot-camps-25h6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had the blessing to be a teacher assistant at two tech boot-camps. I would like to share my observations on what it took to survive, thrive, and grab the reward of graduating from a tech boot camp. In particular, regarding the &lt;strong&gt;resiliency&lt;/strong&gt; factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resiliency is the ability to fail over and over while never giving up. It means to continue to feed the passion and not get discouraged. Finally, it means to do it even though you're afraid or don't feel qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#willing-to-struggle-without-quitting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Willing to Struggle without Quitting
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful boot-campers must be resilient and be willing to struggle without quitting. When talking to them, I learned how they would study at night, in the morning, on their break at work, on vacation, and anytime they were free. &lt;strong&gt;They made learning to code a Priority, not an optional task.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a TA, I encourage my students to carve out time to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you wake early before your family wakes up or code once the kids are asleep? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to create a regular dedicated uninterrupted time period to learn your craft. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I advocate that it's better to learn 1% each day then to cram learning into one weekend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beg, borrow, or steal time from other activities to stay focused on the boot-camp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wDPnNAeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/23pqxwiphz8e9ijjzhc1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wDPnNAeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/23pqxwiphz8e9ijjzhc1.png" alt="Man reading his watch and standing next to a sand hour glass"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#endure-to-the-finish-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Endure to the Finish line
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ones who got the job during or after the boot-camp were those who strive to finish it. They did not quit. There are many concepts and skills that you don't learn the first time you experience them at the beginning of class. &lt;strong&gt;It's the repetition of coding, giving presentations, and completing projects that overtime cements the advanced skills that are needed to be a developer.&lt;/strong&gt; It's constantly being around tech culture over time that allows you to talk about tech in future interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the unfortunate experience of seeing a brilliant student, who mastered concepts at the beginning of class and was my star pupil, get bored and abandon the boot-camp. When I finally had a chance to talk to that student, I found out that what she wanted to learn was simply a few weeks further into the course. If she had stayed, built the foundational skills, and then learned the skills she craved; I have no doubt she would have been a successful developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical Tip: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Each day, plan what challenges you will overcome and what key thing you will learn. Use a calendar, bullet journaling, or a digital to-do list to help you stay focused on the now. Consider that each new skill you learn builds upon each other to build a masterpiece that is impossible to see at this moment in your career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VnP49u17--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p94r3co9meh9pvwd9t4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VnP49u17--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p94r3co9meh9pvwd9t4.png" alt="Woman running across the race's finish line"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-solutions-to-your-unique-learning-challenges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find Solutions to your Unique Learning Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best boot-campers didn't let anything hold them back. They were willing to find solutions to challenges to learning that they faced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember one student who finished all her work 6 weeks early so she could have her baby. I was amazed at the amount of work she accomplished and the focus to never miss an assignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example was when a student had a broken laptop, they used their cell phone, pair-programmed with a fellow student, and utilized a library computer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't make it to class, many students notified me early to see if it can be recorded and then sent questions later to verify their understanding of concepts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments were turned in early just in case something happened before the deadline. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing was going to hold them back from learning and starting a new career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fortify-your-mind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fortify your Mind
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be willing to learn, willing to fail, and willing to stretch your brain muscles. Coding isn't about writing mindless boilerplate code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are constantly learning and testing your brain power. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are testing if you can fail repeatedly and still rise to the challenge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More importantly, you are learning about yourself, how you learn best,  and how to execute your knowledge to overcome software challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical Tip: I can't stress enough how important it is to meditate or pray daily. Coding takes your mind through mental gymnastics on a daily basics. You have to make time to clear your mind, release mental anxiety, and reset your focus. Talk to someone about your problems. There is nothing wrong with crying if it solves the problem. There is nothing wrong with saying, "I'm lost, confuse, etc." You can overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#strengthen-your-body"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Strengthen your Body
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, resiliency means to make sure you are physically capable to endure to the end of the boot-camp. In my opinion, I think medical issues was one of the leading causes of student drop off. You have to take care of yourself. You can’t forgo sleep and expect to remember what you just learned. It comes with no surprise that those who succeeded place a high value on healthy decisions to protect their body and mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UO-gQ0oR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tthmsfpdg8wcsdb9fll8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UO-gQ0oR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tthmsfpdg8wcsdb9fll8.jpg" alt="Man in super-man t-shirt lifting weights"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practices you can emulate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carve out times around work, family, friends, and all the crazy things life throws at you to LEARN. I'm not saying those things aren't important, but you have to decide if this career change is a priority or an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter an obstacle, then plan around, over, under, and through it. But do not quit or stop learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push yourself to survive to the end. I saw them crawl, hobble, pull themselves, or was pull by others to the finish line. But they were determined to not give up. Each person must be resilient to the unique challenges they will face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to learn a lot in a small time period. This means being able to learn how you learn, organize your learning, and quickly act upon that knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to end by saying it's painful as a teacher assistant to watch students fail. They fail for lots of reasons but it normally starts at the beginning of the journey. My advice to any who is aspiring to learn to code is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You sow what you reap. If you want a good harvest, put in the work from the start to the finish. Don't give up on a dream because its hard. Will it be easy. Nope. Will it be worth it. Absolutely ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>How to Animate a Waving Hand Emoji in TailwindCSS</title>
      <author>Alex Kates</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 12:22:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thealexkates/how-to-animate-a-waving-hand-emoji-in-tailwindcss-gn4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thealexkates/how-to-animate-a-waving-hand-emoji-in-tailwindcss-gn4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spent time polishing the mobile reponsivness for my personal site, &lt;a href="https://alexkates.dev"&gt;https://alexkates.dev&lt;/a&gt;, and I wanted to add a little animation flair to some empty space next to my Hero introduction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👋 TL;DR 👋
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the waving hand emoji actually wave using TailwindCSS. &lt;br&gt;
You can &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexkates/waving-hand-tailwind"&gt;find the source code here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BN_UivuD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tagjk9topwthxbud9747.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BN_UivuD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tagjk9topwthxbud9747.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the Setup is taken &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app"&gt;from the TailwindCSS setup guide&lt;/a&gt;. The most jarring part is &lt;a href="https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco"&gt;the use of Craco&lt;/a&gt; instead of the standard react-scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scaffold-cra-tailwindcss-and-craco"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scaffold CRA, TailwindCSS and Craco
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app waving-hand-tailwind

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;waving-hand-tailwind

npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9

npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @craco/craco
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-packagejson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update package.json
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5QJ64Ap2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ucl5titkaemx5kk2ho67.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5QJ64Ap2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ucl5titkaemx5kk2ho67.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-cracoconfigjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure craco.config.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IgbL-99C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vkp30r2wjvmx53g1h94h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IgbL-99C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vkp30r2wjvmx53g1h94h.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-tailwindconfigjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure tailwind.config.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2cW8SJeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gvlkvtehuudnjnqwby1w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2cW8SJeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gvlkvtehuudnjnqwby1w.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#include-tailwindcss-in-indexcss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Include TailwindCSS in index.css
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zEH_0EF2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t57lq180mkatxtz1htwd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zEH_0EF2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t57lq180mkatxtz1htwd.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-the-wave-animation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create the Wave Animation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's break down what is happening here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are extending the TailwindCSS configuration in order to bake in a new animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyframes section defines exactly how the animation transforms during the lifetime of the animation. At 0%, rotate 0 degrees; at 15%, rotate 14 degrees, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the animation definition for &lt;code&gt;wave&lt;/code&gt; to use the wave keyframes, transform for 1.5s, and loop infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JhKgCgOb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3y1e8e57zynmhhc75orz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JhKgCgOb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3y1e8e57zynmhhc75orz.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-appjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update App.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let's add a new span with the hand emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3SyMjYtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kd6vvef8za8k1smregfm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3SyMjYtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kd6vvef8za8k1smregfm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-your-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start Your App
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BN_UivuD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tagjk9topwthxbud9747.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BN_UivuD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tagjk9topwthxbud9747.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction and Types of DBMS</title>
      <author>hebaShakeel</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 12:21:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hebashakeel/introduction-and-types-of-dbms-1n59</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hebashakeel/introduction-and-types-of-dbms-1n59</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Data is a real type object or entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is processed, structured, organized and interpreted data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Database?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Database is a collection of tables, records and key constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is DBMS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBMS is a software for storing data in a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBMS allows to update, modify and create data in the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBMS also provides &lt;strong&gt;security and protection&lt;/strong&gt; to the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBMS acts as a &lt;strong&gt;middle layer&lt;/strong&gt; between the database and the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal of data redundancy(repetition).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy access to data from database using query language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It facilitates backup and recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better Data Integrity(maintaining consistency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of Integrity Constraints(Keys). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It increases consistency and reduces errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex and Time consuming to design DBMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of hardware and software is high to run DBMS software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DBMS consumes large amount of Main Memory and disk space to run efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial training is required for all users to use DBMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components of DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications of DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Railway Reservation System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Library management system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit card transaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media sires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Shopping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human Resource management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telecommunication (eg. TRAI-&amp;gt;Telecom Regularity Authority of India)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical DBMS (Tree-like structure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network DBMS (Graph-like structure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relational DBMS (Related)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Oriented DBMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical DBMS&lt;/strong&gt; - It is a system in which the data elements have a &lt;strong&gt;one to many relationship (1 : N)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
This DBMS organizes data in a tree-like structure, similar to a folder structure in your computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network DBMS&lt;/strong&gt; - It is a system in which the data elements have a &lt;strong&gt;one to one relationship (1 : 1)&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;many to many relationship (N : N)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
This DBMS also has a hierarchical structure, but it organizes data in a graph-like structure.&lt;br&gt;
This DBMS is the most widely used database system before the introduction of relational DBMS (RDBMS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relational DBMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1) This DBMS was introduced by &lt;strong&gt;E.F Codd&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;1970&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
2) In this DBMS, every data item of a table is related to every other data item in another table &lt;strong&gt;(OR)&lt;/strong&gt; Every table is linked (logically) with every other table.&lt;br&gt;
3) Example : SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object-Oriented DBMS&lt;/strong&gt; - Every data is stored in the form of objects.Inheritance, Encapsulation and other properties of Objects can also be achieved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read so far....&lt;br&gt;
Thank You!&lt;br&gt;
I'll see your beautiful face in the next article!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Interview Question #45: Сurrency formatting in JS</title>
      <author>Coderslang: Become a Software Engineer</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 12:07:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/coderslang/javascript-interview-question-45-urrency-formatting-in-js-39l6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/coderslang/javascript-interview-question-45-urrency-formatting-in-js-39l6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmJEUWlo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://learn.coderslang.com/js-test-45.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmJEUWlo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://learn.coderslang.com/js-test-45.png" alt="javascript interview question #45"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to format a string into a local currency in JavaScript? What’s the output?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first line, we create a constant &lt;code&gt;price&lt;/code&gt; of a type &lt;code&gt;BigInt&lt;/code&gt;. This type is often used in finance as it can safely store numbers above the &lt;code&gt;Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we try to format the number &lt;code&gt;99n&lt;/code&gt; into a local currency using the function &lt;code&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure the formatting goes well, we need to pass two arguments into &lt;code&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locale, for example, &lt;code&gt;en-US&lt;/code&gt;, — defines the output format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;object with the formatting options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the formatting options, could be &lt;code&gt;style: 'currency'&lt;/code&gt;. If you specify this option, then the number will be formatted as a currency of a specific region:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;de-DE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en-IN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;INR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These numbers are formatted differently:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$99.00
49,00 €
₹19.00
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, if you look attentively into the original code snippet, you’ll notice, that the options don’t have the &lt;code&gt;currency&lt;/code&gt; field. Without it, the formatting doesn’t make sense and won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error will be thrown and the conversion from &lt;code&gt;BigInt&lt;/code&gt; to a local currency string won't happen.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANSWER&lt;/strong&gt;: An error &lt;code&gt;TypeError: Currency code is required with currency style.&lt;/code&gt; will be logged to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

Discover my hacker experience during the 36 hours of the EthINDIA 2.0 Although this event was a month ago. I would like to share my experience and some details of this type of event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asias-biggest-ethereum-hackathon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Asia’s biggest Ethereum Hackathon
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MLR Convention Centre, JP Nagar, Bangalore(India’s ‘Silicon Valley’) hosted 100 teams from two to three people during a weekend to work 36 consecutive hours at EthIndia. The objective? Innovate ideas using Ethereum dApps. To get it, each team should overcome the challenge of thinking, developing and presenting a technological solution that would provide a good user experience using Ethereum to the Administration. The prizes of $11,000 in bounty prizes were awaiting winners.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_qDgxxow--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w082dp21a0h9q4i9l5bo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_qDgxxow--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w082dp21a0h9q4i9l5bo.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With fellow developers I found through the official IRC Channel, we had the initiative to participate in the EthIndia 2019. I found it an interesting challenge and I accepted the hackathon. Participating in these kinds of events puts our skills to the test. In addition, the competition offered me a threefold motivation: to offer solutions to problems of citizenship, to develop and to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I teamed up with the following developers: Ushana Bandyopadhyay &amp;amp; Anoop Krishnan.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rrw7xYrB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kvakkuufxpfrr4pf2x4e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rrw7xYrB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kvakkuufxpfrr4pf2x4e.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only had two working days to devise the EthINDIA project and the instructions were very clear: 36 hours to define a technological solution related to Ethereum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oH8QCBIO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6yjjoa32wqnn6gidxowq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oH8QCBIO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6yjjoa32wqnn6gidxowq.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stopwatch started. The first step of the team was to decide how we’re gonna present project. We bet for dApp against cyber-bullying. The reason? We were aware that this is a trendy topic and that gave us points. But, we also knew the technicalities in finishing this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the curiosities of the EthIndia that caught my attention was the existing competitiveness, which increased with the passage of the hours.&lt;br&gt;
The night came. That point was the hardest part of the EthINDIA. Changing my usual schedule did not let me rest and this fact was a real psychological struggle against myself. Fortunately, coinciding with the sunrise, we managed to partially complete the project. I just had to prepare the presentation to complete the whole project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rYXu8dkL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r2vd0ppfdwac912izy5s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rYXu8dkL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r2vd0ppfdwac912izy5s.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working for 36 hours it is hard to explain all your work in just 3–4 minutes. Without a doubt, a new challenge. After the 100 participating teams completed their presentations, I waited for deliberations …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we were not the winners. Of course, I realised that the real competition had been against me: struggling against time, disorganisation and technological difficulties. And undoubtedly, I won this competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt it is an unforgettable experience from all points of view. Something that I would recommend that everyone live it. Basically you put to the limit your resolutive capacity, analysis, solve problems, as well as your mind since with the passage of the hours the fatigue takes over, but the feeling of making a simple idea become a reality is the motor that will force us to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and time!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank these people for making my first hackathon a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athul Cyriac Ajay&lt;/strong&gt;- A fellow mallu i met at the event. He was so supportive and friendly to me at the hackathon. He was one of my fav person whom I met at the hackathon. To my amazement, he’s also a Github Campus expert :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anoop Krishnan&lt;/strong&gt;- Another mallu i met at the event. He was my teammate at the hackathon. He was working at a firm in the cyber field. He helped me to get started with linux🐧❤.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ushana Bandyopadhyay&lt;/strong&gt;- My third and final teammate who was a girl (How often do you see a girl who code?🙀). She was honestly one of the very few girls at the event. She gave me company at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this short tutorial, we look at how to check if a string contains a substring in PHP. We also take a look at the other relevant string manipulation methods in PHP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is a part of our initiative at &lt;a href="https://flexiple.com/"&gt;Flexiple&lt;/a&gt;, to write short curated tutorials around often used or interesting concepts. However, in case you are here only for the solution use this &lt;a href="#code-amp-explanation"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-check-if-a-php-sting-contains-a-substring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why check if a PHP sting contains a substring?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to other programming languages, it is a common practice to check if a string contains a substring. This could be for numerous reasons, subsequently, they are a few inbuilt functions that we could use to check if a PHP string contains a substring. The PHP string contains (&lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt;) is one of the most commonly used methods, however, the methods you chose would large me decided based on your use cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to just check if a PHP string contains a substring your can used the &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt; function. if you are looking to check if a PHP sting contains a substring and returns its index you could use the &lt;code&gt;stripos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strpos&lt;/code&gt; methods. With that out of the way let us look at all the methods in depth.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-raw-strcontains-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt; is a new function that was introduced in PHP 8. The &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt; method is used to determine if a PHP string contains a substring. The function checks the string and returns a boolean &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in case it exists and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. However, keep in mind that &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt; is case sensitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#syntax-of-php-raw-strcontians-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Syntax of PHP &lt;code&gt;str_contians&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;str_contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parameters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parameters:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; - Required, the original PHP string that you are looking to search&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;substring&lt;/code&gt; - Required, the substring that you are looking to check if the PHP string contains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-amp-explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code &amp;amp; Explanation:
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hire the top 1% freelance developers"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;str_contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Hire'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PHP string contains 'Hire'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PHP string does not contain 'Hire"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

//Output: "PHP string contains 'Hire'"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; by placing it inside an &lt;code&gt;if.&lt;/code&gt; however, the &lt;code&gt;str_contains&lt;/code&gt; methods is case sensitive and return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; in case the PHP string contains the substring in a different case. Here is an example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hire the top 1% freelance developers"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;str_contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'hire'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PHP string contains 'Hire'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PHP string does not contain 'Hire"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

//Output: PHP string does not contain 'Hire"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in case you aren't aware of the case of the substring you could use the &lt;code&gt;strtolower()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-raw-stripos-endraw-raw-strpos-endraw-and-raw-strrpos-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using &lt;code&gt;stripos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strpos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strrpos&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are looking to check if a PHP string contains a substring, and to find its index these methods are your solutions. The &lt;code&gt;stripos&lt;/code&gt; method checks if a PHP string contains a substring, and return the index of the first occurrence of the substring. However, the &lt;code&gt;stripos&lt;/code&gt; method is case-insensitive, and if you are looking to case-sensitively check if a PHP string contains a substring you can use the &lt;code&gt;strpos&lt;/code&gt; methods. And lastly, &lt;code&gt;strrpos&lt;/code&gt; unlike the previous two, this method returns the last occurrence of the substring in the original PHP string. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#syntax-of-raw-stripos-endraw-raw-strpos-endraw-and-raw-strrpos-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Syntax of &lt;code&gt;stripos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strpos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strrpos&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Syntax of stripos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;stripos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Syntax of strpos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;strpos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Syntac of strrpos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;strrpos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parameters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parameters:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; - Required, the original PHP string that you are looking to search&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;substring&lt;/code&gt; - Required, the substring that you are looking to check if the PHP string contains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; - Optional, specific where the search for the substring should begin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#returns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Returns:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When used to check if a PHP string contains a substring all the three methods return an index between &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; if the substring is not found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given that 0 is also a falsy value remember to use the identical or not identical operator &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;! ==&lt;/code&gt; and not the equal to operator &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; also would be considered as &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. You can refer to the code below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-amp-explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code &amp;amp; Explanation:
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hire the top 1% freelance developers"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$substring_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;stripos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Top"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$substring_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"'Top' is a substring!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$substring_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"'top' is a substring!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output = 'Top' is a substring!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output = 'top' is a substring!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;code&gt;stripos&lt;/code&gt; is case insensitive, it does not return a &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; when used to check if the PHP string contains the &lt;code&gt;'Top'&lt;/code&gt; substring. However, this is not the case when &lt;code&gt;strpos&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;strrpos&lt;/code&gt; are used. Now let's look at a case where the index is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hire the top 1% freelance developers"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$substring_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;stripos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Top"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$substring_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"'Hire' is a substring"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"'Hire' is not a substring"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output = "'Hire' is not a substring"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$substring_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"'Hire' is a substring"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"'Hire' is not a substring"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Output = "'Hire' is a substring"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see the initial &lt;code&gt;! =&lt;/code&gt; operator considers 0 as &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; this is why it is important to your the identical operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#limitations-and-caveats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Limitations and Caveats
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which using the latter functions to check if PHP string contains a value remember to use the identical operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all methods are case-insensitive, ensure to use the &lt;code&gt;strtolower()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Building personal blog with Next.js</title>
      <author>Pavel Polívka</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 11:48:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/building-personal-blog-with-next-js-2d0i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/building-personal-blog-with-next-js-2d0i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was trying to figure out what my page should look like. Should it have a blog? Should I use some of the popular blogging platforms? I tried everything. I liked &lt;a href="https://hashnode.com/"&gt;Hashnode&lt;/a&gt; as it offers great tools, support for custom domains, and other cool features. But in the end, I was not happy with the result. I need more customizations, I need more freedom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried building it on my own with Spring Boot and Hotwire. I like this stack and agree with the philosophy of Hotwire. Unfortunately, to do this in the scope I would like it would take a lot of time and as a father, I do not have that much time on my hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that Next.JS is pretty popular and for some work reasons I was looking into it. I came across their how to start &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and in the scope of this tutorial (took me about 4 hours), you will build a skeleton blog. &lt;strong&gt;I was surprised how easy and fast it was.&lt;/strong&gt; Then I decided I will take this code and finish the job. In the scope of few evenings, I had the new version of my &lt;a href="https://ppolivka.com"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; built and deployed to production. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tutorial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tutorial
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw a tutorial that is this polished. It was a joy to use and I was feeling like I am moving ahead with the speed of light. The tutorial will go over the most important parts of creating a basic blog. You do not need to be that familiar with React to get the concepts. You just need basic knowledge of JavaScript. I would recommend everybody go through that tutorial even if only to see how to make proper tutorials. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#styling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Styling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not good with CSS. I consider it one of my weaknesses. It always seems like there is tons of way to do the one thing you need, it's never clear and it's magic to me. I was hearing tons of good vibes about TailwindCSS so I decided to try that. You know since I am on this hype wave of trying new stuff. There I was not that lucky. It seems horrible. It just takes all the horrible parts of CSS and moves to a different level. There is no good tutorial. It seems like a complete mess. Maybe I was using it wrong but it seemed I would need to write tons of custom CSS anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go the easiest way and just do the whole thing in pure CSS. No frameworks, no nothing. In the end, I am quite happy with the result, but it's a perfect CSS code. I would say it's CSS spaghetti. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-functionality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Other functionality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I decided to add few features that are not covered by the tutorial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is the Contact Me form. I found a great &lt;a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/coding-a-contact-form-with-next-js-and-nodemailer-d3a8dc6cd645"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. With it was easy to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One small note here. I spent way too much time trying to figure out why the API response was not submitted. Instead of:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;you need to do:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;res.status(200).end()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second one is code highlting in the blog posts. For that I decided to Prism.js library. Here is a code snippet that enables it for you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prism&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;prismjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;prismjs/components/prism-java&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;prismjs/components/prism-typescript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add more if you need&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;highlightAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vercel-hosting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vercel hosting
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest positive surprise for me was the Vercel hosting. It's part of the tutorial as well and it's super easy and super intuitive. You just give them your git repo, they will do the rest of you. Your API endpoints are deployed as serverless functions, everything that should be served from CDN is automatically served from CDN. Adding a custom domain was just a few clicks away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works like magic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sold on Next.JS. If I would be starting my startup I would go for it. It's super easy and yet very powerful. I would host on Vercel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For CSS I would probably go for Bootstrap and it still seems the easiest one to use for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Master Design Patterns By Building Real Projects - Prototype Pattern - Javascript</title>
      <author>Hiep Le</author>

  &lt;a href="#creational-pattern-prototype-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creational Pattern - Prototype Pattern.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part in my series (23 GoF Design Patterns). My series will help you understand about design patterns by building real projects. For this reason, you can see the places in which each pattern could be applied. I want to focus on learning by doing instead of talking too much about theories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm Hiep. I work as a full-time software engineer. Most of my open-source projects are focused on one thing - to help people learn 📚.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a git repository that help you understand about design patterns by building real projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github link: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hieptl/javascript-dessign-patterns"&gt;https://github.com/hieptl/javascript-dessign-patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the repository is useful, please help me share the post and give me a Github's star. It will make me feel motivation to work even harder. I will try to make many open sources and share to the community ❤️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a post to share about &lt;strong&gt;learning React by building Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;, I hope that it is useful for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/hieptl/learn-react-by-building-netflix-1127"&gt;https://dev.to/hieptl/learn-react-by-building-netflix-1127&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="definition"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-definition"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Definition.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prototype pattern will help you to create an object from an existing object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to clone an object in Javascript, we have several ways such as Object.assign(), spread operator, libraries and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we should build by ourselves to understand about the core concepts. Therefore, we will feel more interested in programming and increase logical thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="scenarios"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-scenarios"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Scenarios.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can imagine that dev.to provides a feature that allows the authors clone their existing posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, there are several ways that help us to clone an object in Javascript. However, we will create the solution by ourselves by using Prototype pattern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="building-post-cloner"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-building-post-cloner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Building Post Cloner.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to use Javascript class to implement the idea because in the case you are using object-oriented programming languages or you have to use those languages in the future, you can still implement design patterns by using different languages. In my opinion, design patterns are mindset and approaches and not depend on programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Post class will be looked like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Post Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Post Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondPost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The first post: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The second post: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the constructor, we accept &lt;strong&gt;title&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt; as parameters. It means that when the author wants to create a new post, the author needs to input title and content for the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important part is about the &lt;strong&gt;clone&lt;/strong&gt; method. The method will help us to create a new object from an existing object. &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; keyword is used to refer to the properties of the current instance (the existing object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="result"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Result.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="figure1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sPn6_mgG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bfwdd326btjnog8g2up1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sPn6_mgG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bfwdd326btjnog8g2up1.png" alt="prototype"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1. Prototype Pattern - Result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above image describes that the content of the first post and the content of the second post are the same after running the code. We implemented the idea by using Prototype pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using design patterns, we can understand the core concepts and make our code become more readable and cleaner. I hope that the post can help you understand about Prototype pattern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks and Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;
Hiep.&lt;/p&gt;
