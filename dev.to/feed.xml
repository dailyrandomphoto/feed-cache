      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy, as a concept, often lacks a clear definition. However, privacy-enhancing technologies can be generally categorised into two broad desiderata. The purpose of this post is to lay these goals out clearly in accessible terms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone talks about privacy, what on earth do they mean? If you consult a dictionary, you'll likely get a definition based on not being observed by others and free from public or third-party attention. This could lead to many definitions in the context of technology. The term can range in context from preventing browser tracking through cookies, to limiting your digital footprint from being shared by data holders. At Oblivious, we focus on the latter, allowing organizations who collect information to use and manipulate it in a safe and secure manner, such that you (a data subject) can rest assured that no superfluous data sharing is performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed the definition of privacy can cause a lot of confusion. Lawyers, politicians, security experts, and technologists all talk about privacy but often mean quite different things. If you reading this you are maybe aware of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) which are technological ways of dealing with privacy problems that, frankly speaking, often arise due to the exploitation of other data technologies that no legal frameworks can sufficiently deal with. Federated learning, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, secure enclaves are all examples of PETs, which come in handy when you want to ensure privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the two major groups of privacy technology are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input privacy allows multiple parties to input sensitive data to be combined for some pre-agreed purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output privacy prevents the reverse engineering of inputs given the outputs of a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#input-privacy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Input Privacy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first scenario wherein two millionaires want to determine who is richer but do not want to reveal each others' wealth. This is a classic 40-year old problem in computer science called Yao’s millionaire’s problem. It forms the basis of so-called multi-party computation or input privacy. It describes situations when two or more parties wish to evaluate a joint function depended on everyone's sensitive inputs, however, they do not want to reveal those inputs to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, a range of solutions may be employed. All the parties can simply give their inputs to a trusted friend, lawyer or consulting company as often happens in real life. However, if they want to employ cryptography they have even more options - they can use secure multi-party computation protocols (SMPC), which evaluate a function directly on encrypted data. It is based on a range of cryptographic primitives, which are still heavily researched - from garbled circuits to homomorphic encryption. A caveat here is that using these approaches severely slows down the computation and as always with new cryptographic protocols one has to be very careful with the threat models employed and how different subprotocols are combined. If you make a mistake at this step, it could have the consequence of not encrypting the data in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RPtj6qR0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x9pr3eosihh5hyokvzpm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RPtj6qR0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x9pr3eosihh5hyokvzpm.png" alt="Multiple inputs coming in and out of a function from different parties."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to refer to hardware-based approaches called trusted execution environments or secure enclaves, whereby the parties send their encrypted data to a chip or a virtual machine (VM) with additional security layers. This chip or the cloud provider hosting the VM cryptographically sign and hash the software that is run that combines the data, attesting to the data providers that it is safe for the data to be decrypted. Major chip and cloud providers have moved towards this direction under the umbrella of confidential computing in recent years. As an example, AWS has recently launched its Nitro Enclaves and you can read more about this in our previous blog post.‌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three options have their pros and cons, you are either trusting in humans, cryptography, or the chip/cloud providers cryptographic attestation and consequently they are bottlenecked by human (bureaucracy and human processing), cryptographic (often large packet sizes with many rounds of communication) or hardware-based (RAM) limitations. Nevertheless, all three tackle this challenge of data collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output-privacy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output Privacy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have chosen our favourite approach to input privacy and each party is happy that nobody else can see their sensitive inputs. They might even use it multiple times with slightly different inputs and parties. Can they safely announce the end of their “privacy problem”? Well, not really as we have not looked carefully at the output of this function!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one or more parties receive the output, there surely is some information about each others' input in it. It may well be that by running it multiple times with different inputs the others can work out our inputs from the outputs. To prevent this in many cases output privacy techniques can be employed.&lt;br&gt;
Output privacy challenges are very well-known to statistics bureaus. Wherever you live, it is quite likely that within the last 10 years you have taken part in a census. When the census data is aggregated and shared, statistics bureaus employ statistical disclosure control techniques to ensure that no individual or house can be identified from the published data.&lt;br&gt;
How do you do that? One technique that helps in this is the so-called k-anonymity. It is very intuitive and you have probably used or thought about it already without being aware of it. When releasing data you group people together and publish data for that group. For example, you group people under the age brackets, districts, etc, and ensure that in the smallest identifiable group there is at least k number of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option, which is very often used in data science, is synthetic data. Large corporates that work with external parties such as data science consultants do not usually give away their proprietary data during the pilot phases of joint projects or for testing purposes but instead often give them fake data that resemble and share statistical properties of the underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---33V61w6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dxsatqbzo73y4dhj9a86.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---33V61w6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dxsatqbzo73y4dhj9a86.png" alt="Outputs of a function being perturbed by noise to prevent reverse-engineering."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US census bureau has decided to use another cryptographic technique called differential privacy for its 2020 census. Differential privacy is gaining usage and popularity due to its mathematical guarantees and widespread applicability. It works by adding appropriate noise to the output of a function. The challenge here is to add such amount of noise that the output still provides useful information but prevents anyone who has access to that output from reverse-engineering the original data - in particular information about individuals. The rule of thumb is that the larger the dataset, the smaller noise needs to be added to the aggregated output to ensure privacy. Hence, the large-scale data published by the census bureau are equal to what the true underlying value that they would normally publish is. However, at the township or district level, the noise kicks in and the values differ slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-and-contrasting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing and Contrasting
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the above, you might be thinking that these sound very different and, well, you are kind of right! Input privacy really takes into account each known party and their interactions in a calculation. It prevents each party from learning something they shouldn't be able to about other parties' inputs. Output privacy does the same for the party who receives the output of a calculation - typically limiting their ability to learn about individuals rather than aggregates.‌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-everything-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting everything together
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‌&lt;br&gt;
Now that we are pros when speaking about input privacy and output privacy techniques, it becomes natural to combine them together to ensure privacy in a larger set of use cases. We can evaluate join queries over data coming from multiple sources both without seeing the data in plaintext and giving guarantees about the output privacy. Such end-to-end privacy systems are something that we at Oblivious are very much focused on. If you want to have a run at playing with how secure enclaves can be used in conjunction with differentially private output guarantees, give us a shout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hWJUf289--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rj8f9xyeadt9xyxwmgzb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hWJUf289--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rj8f9xyeadt9xyxwmgzb.png" alt="Placing systems with differential privacy inside trusted execution environments."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-buzzword-mapper"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus: Buzzword Mapper
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus for making it to the end of the article, we thought we'd map some privacy-tech buzzwords to the type of privacy they enforce. Hopefully, at the next (socially distanced) cocktail party you go to when the cryptographer starts spouting on about one of these you'll at least have a bearing on what they are trying to achieve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--90oS-fBU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vb48im735fb2fry71oih.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--90oS-fBU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vb48im735fb2fry71oih.png" alt="Buzzwords, what they endeavour to do and how."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Scrum master shuffle</title>
      <author>Jelle Smeets</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:28:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/the-scrum-master-shuffle-2ome</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/the-scrum-master-shuffle-2ome</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you have been scrum master for the same team for a longer period, it can become more difficult to find areas of improvement for the team. If you are unsure of what the next step in the development of your team should be, the Scrum master shuffle might be interesting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blogpost we will dive into the Scrum master shuffle, I'll explain what it is, how to use it, and the lessons I learned from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-scrum-master-shuffle"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Scrum master shuffle
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Scrum master shuffle is to switch teams with another Scrum master in your organization for a short time, usually, we do one or two sprints. During this shuffle, you will effectively become a Scrum master for a different team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Scrum master in one team for a longer period of time, it is normal to get blind spots. There are things you don't notice anymore but will catch the eye of a fresh Scrum master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other benefit besides having a fresh pair of eyes on your blind spots, is to get the team outside of their normal routine. A new Scrum master will probably shake up things, and it might get some of team members that have settled down to the situation to get that spark again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps for a successful Scrum master shuffle are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a Scrum master to shuffle with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform your team that this is for gathering insights, and the goal is to improve. It is in no way a punishment for underperforming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a short 1 on 1 with the product owner and stakeholder of your new team, and inform them that the idea behind the shuffle is to improve the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the shuffle write down things that catch your attention. This will be input for the bullet point below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a weekly or biweekly meeting with the Scrum master you are shuffling with. The main goal of the meeting: "Is there anything that caught your eye?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the shuffle plan a small retrospective with the team, "is there anything I did differently than your Scrum master?", try to get input on the team what they liked, and what they liked less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate all findings, and pick which ones you or the team wants to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#takeaways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past I have done the Scrum master shuffle a couple of times now, my main takeaways and tips for the best result are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a Scrum master that has a different "style" than you have, this will usually result in better results than if you pick a Scrum master with the same style, as they will probably notice the same things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the team trusts the situation and doesn't feel like they have a temporary Scrum master to get them back on track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of shuffling you want to be in an observing mode, try to observe what is happening before you try to correct behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an open mind, and try not to judge the team for their behaviour, its a result of working together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the takeaways above, the key to a successful Scrum master shuffle is to keep an open mind, try not to judge the team you are in and get them to trust you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in other lessons I learned as a starting Scrum master? Check out &lt;a href="https://blog.jellesmeets.nl/lists/4-lessons-i-learned-as-a-starting-scrum-master/"&gt;The 4 lessons I learned as a starting scrum master&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magic Link Authentication and Route Controls with Supabase and Next.js</title>
      <author>Nader Dabit</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:15:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dabit3/magic-link-authentication-and-route-controls-with-supabase-and-next-js-leo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dabit3/magic-link-authentication-and-route-controls-with-supabase-and-next-js-leo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://supabase.io/"&gt;Supabase&lt;/a&gt; is widely known for their real-time database and API layer, one of the things I like about it is the number of easy to set up &lt;a href="https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth"&gt;authentication mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; it offers out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0klkAzRc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qzcg7ckpfmra2y3yezdf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0klkAzRc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qzcg7ckpfmra2y3yezdf.png" alt="Supabase Auth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#magic-link"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Magic Link
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites is Magic Link. You've probably used magic link in the past. Magic link sends a link to the user via email containing a link to authenticate with the service via a custom URL and access token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the user visits the URL, a session is set in their browser storage and the user is redirected back to the app, authenticating the user in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is becoming a very popular way to authenticate users as they do not have to keep up with another password, it provides a really great user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Next.js, you have the ability to not only protect routes with client-side authorization, but for added security you can do server-side authorization and redirects in &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if a cookie has been set and is available in the request context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also where Supabase comes in handy. There is built-in functionality for setting and getting the cookie for the signed in user in SSR and API routes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-the-user-in-an-api-route"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting the user in an API route
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAuthCookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-the-user-in-an-ssr-or-api-route"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting the user in an SSR or API route
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUserByCookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* if user is present, do something with the user data here */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Server-side redirects are typically preferred over client-side redirects from an SEO perspective - it's harder for search engines to understand how client-side redirects should be treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are also able to access the user profile from an API route using the &lt;code&gt;getUserByCookie&lt;/code&gt; function, opening up an entirely new set of use cases and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Next.js and Supabase you can easily implement a wide variety of applications using this combination of SSG, SSR, and client-side data fetching and user authorization, making the combination (and any framework that offers this combination of capabilities) extremely useful and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-well-be-building"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we'll be building
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we'll build out a Next.js app that enables navigation, authentication, authorization, redirects (client and server-side), and a profile view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project that we'll be building is a great starting point for any application that needs to deal with user identity, and is a good way to understand how user identity works and flows throughout all of the different places in a project using a modern hybrid framework like Next.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final code for this project is located &lt;a href="https://github.com/dabit3/supabase-nextjs-auth"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building the app
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, you first need to create a Supabase account and project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, head over to &lt;a href="//Supabase.io"&gt;Supabase.io&lt;/a&gt; and click &lt;strong&gt;Start Your Project&lt;/strong&gt;. Authenticate with GitHub and then create a new project under the organization that is provided to you in your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i9j6RgBg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d068rhoheuboefej4o70.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i9j6RgBg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d068rhoheuboefej4o70.jpeg" alt="Creating Supabase account"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give the project a Name and Password and click Create new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take approximately 2 minutes for your project to be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, open your terminal and create a new Next.js app:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app supabase-next-auth

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;supabase-next-auth
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only dependency we'll need is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@supabase/supabase-js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @supabase/supabase-js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-the-supabase-credentials"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring the Supabase credentials
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the Next.js app is created, it needs a to know about the Supabase project in order to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to do this is using environment variables. Next.js allows environment variables to be set by creating a file called &lt;strong&gt;.env.local&lt;/strong&gt; in the root of the project and storing them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to expose a variable to the browser you have to prefix the variable with &lt;strong&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC&lt;/strong&gt;_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file called &lt;strong&gt;.env.local&lt;/strong&gt; at the root of the project, and add the following configuration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://app-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-public-api-key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find the values of your API URL and API Key in the Supabase dashboard settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NaUDHjRf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kbrp6pj3m5pj1vf6l9rd.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NaUDHjRf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kbrp6pj3m5pj1vf6l9rd.jpeg" alt="Supabase config"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-supabase-client"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the Supabase client
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the environment variables have been set, we can create a Supabase instance that can be imported whenever we need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file named &lt;strong&gt;client.js&lt;/strong&gt; in the root of the project with the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* client.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@supabase/supabase-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#updating-the-index-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Updating the &lt;strong&gt;index&lt;/strong&gt; page
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's update &lt;strong&gt;pages/index.js&lt;/strong&gt; to be something more simple than what is provided out of the box. This is just meant to serve as a basic landing page&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* pages/index.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../styles/Home.module.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-sign-in-screen"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the sign in screen
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's create the Sign In screen. This will serve a form input for the user to provide their email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the user submits the form, they will receive a magic link to sign in. This will work for both new as well as existing users!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file in the &lt;strong&gt;pages&lt;/strong&gt; directory named &lt;strong&gt;sign-in.js&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* pages/sign-in.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../styles/Home.module.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;submitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSubmitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSubmitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;submitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Please&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;check&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setEmail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main thing in this file is this line of code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By only providing the email address of the user, magic link authentication will happen automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#profile-view"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Profile view
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's create the profile view. Create a new file in the &lt;strong&gt;pages&lt;/strong&gt; directory named &lt;strong&gt;profile.js&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* pages/profile.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;profileData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profileData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/sign-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profileData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/sign-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;420px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;96px auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;signOut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To check for the currently signed in user we call &lt;code&gt;supabase.auth.user()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user is signed in, we set the user information using the &lt;code&gt;setProfile&lt;/code&gt; function set up using the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the user is not signed in, we client-side redirect using the &lt;code&gt;useRouter&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-route"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API Route
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;pages/_app.js&lt;/strong&gt; we'll be needing to call a function to set the cookie for retrieval later in the SSR route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go ahead and create that API route and function. This will be calling the &lt;code&gt;setAuthCookie&lt;/code&gt; API given to us by the Supabase client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file named &lt;strong&gt;auth.js&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;pages/api&lt;/strong&gt; folder and add the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* pages/api/auth.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAuthCookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nav-auth-listener-and-setting-the-session-cookie"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nav, auth listener, and setting the session cookie
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest chunk of code we'll need to write will be in &lt;strong&gt;pages/app.js&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are the things we need to implement here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A listener to fire when authentication state changes (provided by Supabase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A function that will set the cookie with the user session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, we'll also need to keep up with the authenticated state of the user. We do this so we can toggle links, showing or hiding certain links based on if the user is or isn't signed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll demonstrate this here by only showing the &lt;strong&gt;Sign In&lt;/strong&gt; link to users who are not signed in, and hiding it when they are.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* pages/_app.js */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../styles/globals.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authenticatedState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAuthenticatedState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;not-authenticated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* fires when a user signs in or out */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authListener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onAuthStateChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAuthenticatedState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;authenticated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleAuthChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* sets and removes the Supabase cookie */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;navStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authenticatedState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;not-authenticated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/sign-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Sign&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Protected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;navStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linkStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;marginRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last page we need to implement is the route that will demonstrate server-side protection and redirects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we have already implemented setting the cookie, we should now be able to read the cookie on the server if the user is signed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned previously, we can do this with the &lt;code&gt;getUserByCookie&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file in the &lt;strong&gt;pages&lt;/strong&gt; directory named &lt;strong&gt;protected.js&lt;/strong&gt; and add the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;420px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;96px auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getServerSideProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* check to see if a user is set */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getUserByCookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* if no user is set, redirect to the sign-in page */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;destination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/sign-in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* if a user is set, pass it to the page via props */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-it-out"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing it out
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the app is built and we can test it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run the app, open your terminal and run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the app loads, you should be able to sign up, and sign in using the magic link. Once signed in, you should be able to view the profile page and see your user id as well as your email address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-metadata-and-attributes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting metadata and attributes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to continue building out the user's profile, you can do so easily using the &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say we wanted to allow the user's to set their location. We can do so with the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, when we fetch the user's data, we should be able to view their metadata:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3XCKPecQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3l0m3ie9r7ohtmnsu4nf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3XCKPecQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3l0m3ie9r7ohtmnsu4nf.png" alt="User Metadata"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final code for this project is located &lt;a href="https://github.com/dabit3/supabase-nextjs-auth"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  UNIT Testing
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the processing of testing whether a particular unit is working properly or not is called unit testing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#test-scenario-vs-test-case-vs-test-suite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Test Scenario vs Test Case vs Test Suite
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Scenario consists of multiple test case for single scenario&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So there will be different scenarios consists of test cases for a given application example of one scenario is testing login functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Suite is something like grouping of test cases and executing them at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementing-python-unit-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementing Python Unit testing
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will use Python in-built module &lt;strong&gt;unittest&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will  use &lt;strong&gt;TestCase&lt;/strong&gt; class to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also use 3 instance methods &lt;strong&gt;setUp(), test(), tearDown()&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the simple test class&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wDccXfUb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/obnzxr2vrxyila0t4b63.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wDccXfUb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/obnzxr2vrxyila0t4b63.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output of above code is &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SHce8rZI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dowo3gufp6a3isitzvmj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SHce8rZI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dowo3gufp6a3isitzvmj.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we need to be careful that setUp and tearDown method names are fixed but we can change the test method name as we like bit it need to be prefix with "test" example test_sample(), test1().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can include as many test methods we want into the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Note
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every test method setUp(),tearDown() methods will be executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this repeated call of setUp and tearDown methods we can use &lt;strong&gt;setUpClass(), tearDownClass()&lt;/strong&gt; methods, now only one time setup and teardown methods are called regardless of how many number of testcases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hf4B1NkD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z4ea5me8gwpc7jkml8mv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hf4B1NkD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z4ea5me8gwpc7jkml8mv.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O/P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kusOQc29--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3e60n9pg3v9e6bb454a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kusOQc29--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3e60n9pg3v9e6bb454a.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use assert functions in test method &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you learned something!!!&lt;br&gt;
Happy coding!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coding Standards and Best Practices for Python Code Quality</title>
      <author>Jay Baer</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:33:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/h32239897jay/coding-standards-and-best-practices-for-python-code-quality-4n0l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/h32239897jay/coding-standards-and-best-practices-for-python-code-quality-4n0l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this testing tutorial, you’ll read about the best &lt;a href="https://www.zenesys.com/blog/coding-standards-and-best-practices-for-python-code-quality"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; unit test frameworks to test and correct individual units of code thus helping in overall test automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name indicates, Unit testing is a software testing method meant for testing small units of code. These are typically small, automated pieces of code written by software developers to check and ensure that the particular piece of code only behaves the way it was intended to. In python, there are several frameworks available for this purpose and here we will discuss the major “python test automation frameworks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-python-unit-test-frameworks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best Python Unit Test Frameworks:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-unittest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Unittest:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was inspired by the Junit, a Unit Testing framework of Java programming language and if you are coming from the java background, you get hold of it easily. It is a default testing framework of &lt;a href="https://www.zenesys.com/web-development-services/python-web-development"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s why most developers use it for python test automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of code with this framework is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import unittest2 standard_library_import_a&lt;br&gt;
text =  ‘unit testing in python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class TestString(unittest2.TestCase):&lt;br&gt;
def test_string_uppercase(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.assertEqual(text.upper(),‘UNIT TESTING IN PYTHON’)&lt;br&gt;
import third_party_import_c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_string_isupper(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.assertTrue(‘UNIT TESTING IN PYTHON’.isupper())&lt;br&gt;
self.assertFalse(‘unit testing in python’.isupper())&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_string_split(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.assertEqual(text.split(),[‘unit’, ‘testing’, ‘in’, ‘python’])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to Discover Tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cd project_folder&lt;br&gt;
python -m unittest discover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#skipping-test-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Skipping test cases:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unittest allows test cases to be skipped if certain conditions are not met by using the skip() decorator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@unittest2.skip(“An example of Skipping”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_nothing(self):&lt;br&gt;
pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@unittest2.skipUnless(sys.platform.startswith(“win”), “Windows Platform needed”)&lt;br&gt;
def test_windows_support(self):&lt;br&gt;
A specific windows only code&lt;br&gt;
pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unittest offers simple test execution and faster report generation. One more important plus point for this module is that it is a part of the Python standard library and hence no extra efforts needed to install it. There are also certain drawbacks like it uses camelCase convention instead of snake case convention of Python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-pytest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. PyTest:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pytest is an open-source library and pip is needed to install this. In comparison to unittest, PyTest makes the testing simple and easy with less coding. It is a general-purpose python unit test framework but used especially for functional and API testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of several assert statements, a simple assert method is used in Pytest to reduce confusion and keep the text easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_uppercase():&lt;br&gt;
assert “pytest example”.upper() == “PYTEST EXAMPLE”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_reversed_list():&lt;br&gt;
assert list(reversed([‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]))== [‘d’, ‘c’, ‘b’, ‘a’]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_odd_number():&lt;br&gt;
assert 13 in{&lt;br&gt;
num&lt;br&gt;
for num in range(1, 100)&lt;br&gt;
if num % 2 == 1&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon running the above code, the output looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ pytest&lt;br&gt;
================= test session starts ==================&lt;br&gt;
platform linux — Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1&lt;br&gt;
rootdir: /home/abhinav/PycharmProjects/python_testing_framework/test_code&lt;br&gt;
collected 3 items &lt;br&gt;
test_code.py … [100%]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;================== 3 passed in 0.02s =====================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixtures in Pytest:&lt;br&gt;
Fixtures are used when to provide a consistent reliable input context for the tests. In Pytests, fixtures are made by a function syntax by a decorator usually, as shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;br&gt;
def number():&lt;br&gt;
a = 10&lt;br&gt;
b = 20&lt;br&gt;
c = 30&lt;br&gt;
return [a, b, c]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_method1(number):&lt;br&gt;
x = 10&lt;br&gt;
assert number[0] == x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_method2(number):&lt;br&gt;
y = 15&lt;br&gt;
assert number[1] == y&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_method3(number):&lt;br&gt;
z = 30&lt;br&gt;
assert number[2] == z&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pytest has several plugins and is able to run tests in parallel. If you work with the Django framework for building APIs, there is a special plugin named pytest-Django for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-doctest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Doctest:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doctest module searches for docstrings to verify that all the examples work as documented in the code. It checks if all the interactive python shell examples still work as documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from doctest import testmod&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;define a function to test&lt;br&gt;
def square_of_number(n):&lt;br&gt;
‘’’&lt;br&gt;
This function calculates the square of number a provides output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;square_of_number(3)&lt;br&gt;
9&lt;br&gt;
square_of_number(-5)&lt;br&gt;
25&lt;br&gt;
‘’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;return n * n&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;call the testmod function&lt;br&gt;
if &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; == ‘&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt;’:&lt;br&gt;
testmod(name=’square_of_number’, verbose=True)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you try the above piece of code running it as a file, you will get the following output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying:&lt;br&gt;
square_of_number(3)&lt;br&gt;
Expecting:&lt;br&gt;
9&lt;br&gt;
ok&lt;br&gt;
Trying:&lt;br&gt;
square_of_number(-5)&lt;br&gt;
Expecting:&lt;br&gt;
25&lt;br&gt;
ok&lt;br&gt;
1 item had no tests:&lt;br&gt;
square_of_number&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 item passed all tests:&lt;br&gt;
2 tests in square_of_number.square_of_number&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 tests in 2 items.&lt;br&gt;
2 passed and 0 failed.&lt;br&gt;
Test passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctest has two functions, testfile() and testmod(), we’ve used testmode() in this example which is used for a module. The test file function uses a file as documentation. The problem with doctest is that it only compares the printed output. Any variation from that will result in a test failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4testify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4.Testify:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is modelled after unittest in such a way that the tests are written for unittest will run with some minor adjustments. It is a replacement to both unittest and nose2. It has a class level setup and contains class level teardown and fixture methods. Its fixtures take a decorator-based approach thus eliminating the need for the superclass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from testify import *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class SquareTestCase(TestCase):&lt;br&gt;
@class_setup&lt;br&gt;
def initialise_the_variable(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.variable = 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@setup&lt;br&gt;
def square_the_variable(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.variable = self.variable * self.variable&lt;br&gt;
print(self.variable)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def test_the_variable(self):&lt;br&gt;
assert_equal(self.variable, 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@teardown&lt;br&gt;
def square_root_the_variable(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.variable = self.variable /self.variable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@class_teardown&lt;br&gt;
def get_rid_of_the_variable(self):&lt;br&gt;
self.variable = None&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; == “&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt;”:&lt;br&gt;
run()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of the above test is shown below. As you run the tests you will notice that the code seems more Pythonic than unittest. &lt;br&gt;
It has a better pythonic naming convention than unittest, extensible plugin system for additional functionality, and an enhanced &lt;br&gt;
test discovery which can drill down into packages to find the test cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(venv) zenesys@python_testing_framework$ python3 testify_example.py&lt;br&gt;
4&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
PASSED. 1 test / 1 case: 1 passed, 0 failed. (Total test time 0.00s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-nose2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Nose2:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nose2 can run both doctest and unittests, it is a successor to the Nose regiment. It is also called “extended unit test” pr “unittest with a plugin” because it is based upon most unit modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nose2 only supports the python versions which are currently supported by python teams officially. While nose loads test lazily, nose2 loads all tests first and then begins test execution. It only supports the same level of fixtures as that of the unittest, which means only class level and module level fixtures are supported and not package level ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of unit test and output is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import unit test from nose2.tools import params&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@params(1, 2, 3)&lt;br&gt;
def test_nums(num):&lt;br&gt;
assert num &amp;lt; 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class Test(unittest.TestCase):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@params((1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5))&lt;br&gt;
def test_less_than(self, a, b):&lt;br&gt;
assert a &amp;lt; b&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nose2&lt;br&gt;
………&lt;br&gt;
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — &lt;br&gt;
Ran 9 tests in 0.001s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mp plugin of nose2 enables it to run across multiple processors. This multiprocessing may speed up if the tests are heavily IO bound but it also complicates the text fixtures and can conflict with the plugins which are not designed to work with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As python is growing in its popularity, more and more updates are coming to existing libraries making it more simplistic and user-friendly. In my opinion, if you want to continue with python, you should focus on more pythonic libraries, as python has more about easy and well-structured syntax. Slowness in many cases is reduced by C extensions of Python libraries and that works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unit Tests provide the code more validity and ensure that the code works the way it was supposed to work. I have cleared all the basics for these 5 major testing frameworks. There is much more to learn in unit testing but I hope that this blog has provided you much the needed introduction and foundation to move forward and choose the framework as per your compatibility and requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine um projeto web que mostre os dados dos usuários em um componente cartão que será usado em várias páginas no projeto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mgqukq5W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ymu8qtffmms3ag7zbps.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Mgqukq5W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ymu8qtffmms3ag7zbps.png" alt="Card do usuário"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ao invés de copiar e colar este código em vários arquivos HTML diferentes, podemos criar nossa própria tag que renderiza este cartão e encapsula os estilos (CSS) e comportamentos (JavaScript). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primeiro, criamos o um arquivo &lt;code&gt;UserCard.js&lt;/code&gt; que conterá o código JavaScript deste componente e criamos uma classe representando este componente:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Até aqui, esta é apenas a declaração de uma classe em JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#custom-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Custom Elements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como queremos criar uma tag, devemos definí-la como um &lt;strong&gt;elemento HTML&lt;/strong&gt;. Para isto, basta fazer nossa classe implementar a interface &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#htmlelement"&gt;&lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; é uma interface que implementa outra chamada &lt;a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-element"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Element&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - que é a interface base mais geral da qual todos os objetos em um &lt;em&gt;Document&lt;/em&gt; implementam. De acordo com a documentação, se queremos criar uma tag, o mais indicado é usar &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt;, já que esta provê todos os recursos necessários para construção de uma tag HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Após isso, colocamos o construtor e chamamos o &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; da interface &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E, por último, precisamos registrar nossa tag no &lt;a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#customelementregistry"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CustomElementRegistry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - que está disponível globalmente pela variável &lt;code&gt;customElements&lt;/code&gt; e permite registrar um elemento customizado em uma página:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O método &lt;code&gt;define()&lt;/code&gt; de &lt;code&gt;customElements&lt;/code&gt; recebe como parâmetro o nome da tag a ser definida e o objeto que vai encapsular o código necessário para sua construção. O nome da tag exige o caractere "-" (traço). Caso este padrão não seja seguido e o nome da tag seja definido, por exemplo, como &lt;code&gt;usercard&lt;/code&gt;, receberemos um &lt;code&gt;DOMException&lt;/code&gt; no momento de usar a tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Uncaught&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DOMException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Failed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;CustomElementRegistry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;usercard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;custom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Por este motivo manteremos o nome como &lt;code&gt;user-card&lt;/code&gt;. E para usar nossa nova tag, devemos importá-la em um arquivo HTML e utilizar com a mesma sintaxe de uma tag comum:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- arquivo index.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Web Components&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;user-card&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/user-card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UserCard.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Como nossa tag não faz nada até o momento, nada vai aparecer no navegador além da frase "Web Components" ao abrir o arquivo &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. Todo elemento HTML tem a propriedade &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML"&gt;&lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; que corresponde ao seu conteúdo. Para vermos algum resultado, vamos sobrescrever esta propriedade com algum conteúdo - por exemplo, com o nome do usuário do componente cartão que estamos desenvolvendo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Fulano de Tal&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Que vai gerar o resultado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TWWp9zxI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bly3nkees0x4cu5ivt1v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TWWp9zxI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bly3nkees0x4cu5ivt1v.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Templates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nossa tag customizada, apesar de simples, já funciona como esperado. Agora vamos utilizar e entender um pouco sobre outro recurso bastante utilizado quando trabalhamos com componentes web que são os &lt;code&gt;Templates&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Com templates, é possível definir blocos de códigos reutilizáveis. Apesar de já conseguirmos isso sem eles, os templates apresentam uma forma mais racional de fazer isso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suponha que queremos repetir o uso de nosso componente várias vezes na página. Seriam muitas chamadas de &lt;code&gt;this.innerHTML = "&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Fulano de Tal&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;. Ou seja, construiria esse elemento várias vezes, sendo que uma única vez já seria necessário. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ao invés de adicionarmos o conteúdo com &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; toda vez que o objeto é construído, podemos usar templates. Como dito na documentação do &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template"&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;O  elemento HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; é um mecanismo para encapsular um conteúdo do lado do cliente que não é renderizado quando a página é carregada, mas que pode ser instanciado posteriormente em tempo de execução usando JavaScript.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portanto, ao criarmos algum conteúdo dentro da tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, este conteúdo não é mostrado imediatamente. Mas pode ser clonado para ser posteriormente renderizado:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Fulano de Tal&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// código removido&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note que criamos o template fora da classe. Agora será preciso clonar o conteúdo deste template que está disponível pelo atributo &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;. E para clonar o conteúdo, utilizamos o método &lt;code&gt;cloneNode()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O método &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cloneNode()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recebe um parâmetro booleano para indicar se os elementos filhos do nó que está sendo clonado devem ser clonados juntos ou não. Vamos definir com o valor &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; para clonar os filhos também.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora devemos pegar este elemento clonado e adicionar em nosso componente através do método &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild"&gt;&lt;code&gt;appendChild()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Fulano de Tal&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Esta técnica reduz o custo de análise do HTML porque o conteúdo do modelo é analisado apenas uma vez pelo &lt;a href="https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#the-domparser-interface"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DOMParser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enquanto que chamar &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; dentro do construtor irá analisar o HTML para cada instância. Isso garante uma melhoria na performance de nosso componente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#atributos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Atributos
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E se quisermos que cada componente que será renderizado na página tenha um conteúdo diferente? Podemos, como qualquer tag HTML, definir atributos. Por exemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- arquivo index.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Web Components&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;user-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Fulano de Tal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/user-card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;user-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Ciclano de Tal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/user-card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UserCard.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O atributo &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; é definido por nós e pode ter o nome que considerarmos conveniente. Neste momento, nosso template está com um conteúdo fixo e devemos modificar de acordo com atributo &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; recebido pela nossa tag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Como nosso componente é um &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt;, podemos usar e abusar de todos os recursos que uma tag comum do HTML possui, como o método &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element/getAttribute"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getAttribute()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; para pegar o valor do atributo &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; que definimos anteriormente. E teremos o resultado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y3cKQaY6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9xehjqqstppc41ncf6xp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y3cKQaY6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9xehjqqstppc41ncf6xp.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shadow-dom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Shadow DOM
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora que aprendemos um pouco sobre templates, vamos adicionar um estilo para nosso componente. Primeiro, vamos adicionar um estilo para a tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; diretamente no arquivo &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- arquivo index.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Web&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"Fulano de Tal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"Ciclano de Tal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;"UserCard.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E vamos obter o seguinte resultado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YRyzQIfi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kusxluccnucyfel8qwln.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YRyzQIfi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kusxluccnucyfel8qwln.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como todos os elementos da página, inclusive de nosso componente, estão dentro de uma tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt;, todos receberão o estilo global. Mas podemos adicionar um estilo específico para nosso componente, modificando a cor para azul, por exemplo. Podemos adicionar a tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; em nosso template:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        h2 {
            color: blue;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora temos dois estilos na página para tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt;, o estilo global dentro do arquivo &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; e o estilo dentro de nosso componente. Qual será que vai ser aplicado em cada caso? Ao renderizar a página, obtemos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xTGDFwr0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/msv3z9nq62mze196qo25.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xTGDFwr0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/msv3z9nq62mze196qo25.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repare que o estilo de nosso componente foi aplicado também para o conteúdo da tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; fora dele. Isso acontece porque o template com o estilo de nosso componente é carregado por último e acaba por sobrescrever o estilo da tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; externo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você pode argumentar que podemos evitar isso utilizando classes CSS e você está totalmente correto! Mas imagine o cenário de um projeto grande em que cada desenvolvedor é responsável por um componente específico. Há grandes chances de nomes iguais de classes CSS serem utilizadas, e isso pode gerar um grande transtorno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para evitar este tipo de conflito que trabalharemos com outro recurso chamado de &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt;. A ideia é encapsular código HTML, CSS e JavaScript de nosso componente para não provocar e/ou sofrer alteração externa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt; é uma sub árvore do DOM que tem seu próprio escopo e que não faz parte do DOM original, tornando possível construir interfaces modulares sem que entrem em conflito uma com a outra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1UdgC2XG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1emfdfo36wrpt0hkuyme.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1UdgC2XG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1emfdfo36wrpt0hkuyme.png" alt="Shadow DOM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;fonte da imagem: MDN Web Docs
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como especificado no &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM"&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt;, existem algumas terminologias do &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt; que devemos conhecer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow host&lt;/strong&gt;: o nó DOM regular ao qual o Shadow DOM está anexado.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow tree&lt;/strong&gt;: a árvore DOM dentro do Shadow DOM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow boundary&lt;/strong&gt;: o lugar onde termina o Shadow DOM e começa o DOM regular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow root&lt;/strong&gt;: o nó raiz da Shadow tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dito isto, vamos ver como funciona na prática. Iremos isolar nosso componente dentro de um &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt;. Para isso, precisamos criar o nó raiz &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; dentro de nosso componente - que será o &lt;code&gt;Shadow Host&lt;/code&gt;. A classe &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt; possui o método &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;attachShadow()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; que podemos utilizar para abrir e criar uma referência para um &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; possui dois modos: aberto e fechado. Antes de entrarmos nas diferenças entre esses dois modos, iremos criar nosso &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; no modo aberto para ver como ele funciona. O método &lt;code&gt;attachShadow()&lt;/code&gt; exige que passemos o modo como parâmetro:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        h2 {
            color: blue;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// criando o Shadow Root&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Após esta mudança, ao renderizar novamente a página, vemos que nosso componente não é renderizado e volta a receber o estilo global definido para a tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xBXA3cO---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5fbv4y69y3f3f3z37oyp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xBXA3cO---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5fbv4y69y3f3f3z37oyp.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mas é possível verificar que o &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; foi criado inspecionando a página através da ferramenta &lt;code&gt;DevTools&lt;/code&gt; do navegador pela aba &lt;code&gt;Elemets&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y8i6jiou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6yn9xtjugolag689m8jz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y8i6jiou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6yn9xtjugolag689m8jz.png" alt="Shadow Root"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note que o conteúdo do template também foi anexado a tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;user-card&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; mas não é mostrado já que está fora do &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt;. Uma vez aberto o &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt;, devemos anexar os conteúdos, como nosso template, dentro dele. Após a chamada do método &lt;code&gt;attachShadow()&lt;/code&gt;, uma referência ao objeto &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; aberto é disponibilizado através do atributo &lt;code&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        h2 {
            color: blue;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// código modificado&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// código modificado&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora, nosso componente é renderizado como antes porque foi anexado ao &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt;, vamos novamente inspecioná-lo pela ferramenta &lt;code&gt;DevTools&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rT9RWcqv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rptcbiphu6599qolclj0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rT9RWcqv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rptcbiphu6599qolclj0.png" alt="Shadow Root"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note que agora o conteúdo está dentro do &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt;. E como ele está dentro de uma &lt;code&gt;Shadow Tree&lt;/code&gt; separada do DOM original, os estilos globais não afetam nosso componente e o resultado da renderização da página é este:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J5xwNSb1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x2wxhjtwcqtbx3k0m102.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J5xwNSb1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x2wxhjtwcqtbx3k0m102.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Este foi um exemplo utilizado para encapsular os estilos. Mas o mesmo vale para eventos que possam ser registrados em nosso componente - como um evento de &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; que pode afetar muitos elementos de uma página e o &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt; vai garantir o encapsulamento. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora que vimos um pouco como o &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt; funciona, vamos entender a diferença entre os modos aberto e fechado. O &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; no modo aberto permite que façamos modificações em sua estrutura utilizando JavaScript. Se quisermos acessar o &lt;code&gt;Shadow Root&lt;/code&gt; de nosso componente, basta digitar no console:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Isso nos permite acessar o &lt;code&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; de nosso componente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xXnqShWZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj0zeb4j5dkh1pmzejnc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xXnqShWZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj0zeb4j5dkh1pmzejnc.png" alt="Shadow Root"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E fazer modificações em seu conteúdo, como modificar o conteúdo da tag &lt;code&gt;h2&lt;/code&gt; de nosso componente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iGwj3PT---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/23c9o0nt171z8lozu2vk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iGwj3PT---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/23c9o0nt171z8lozu2vk.png" alt="Shadow Root"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repare que o encapsulamento, neste sentido, é quebrado já que podemos modificar sua estrutura através do JavaScript. Para que o encapsulamento seja realmente aplicado é que existe o modo fechado do &lt;code&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/code&gt;. Vamos modificar nosso componente para o modo fechado:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        h2 {
            color: blue;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// modificado para o modo fechado&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mas, ao fazer isso, nosso componente nem sequer é renderizado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xBXA3cO---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5fbv4y69y3f3f3z37oyp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xBXA3cO---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5fbv4y69y3f3f3z37oyp.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isso acontece porque o acesso ao atributo &lt;code&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; não é mais possível. &lt;code&gt;this.shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; agora vai retornar &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; e receberemos o seguinte erro no console:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XY5GYPsi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o259rdozk7pi3epxbjck.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XY5GYPsi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o259rdozk7pi3epxbjck.png" alt="Console JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portanto, não será mais possível acessar o &lt;code&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; externamente pelo JavaScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l73Qf7NB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdy1517lgq42homspa9q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l73Qf7NB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdy1517lgq42homspa9q.png" alt="Shadow Root"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Só será possível fazê-lo dentro de nosso componente. Para isso, criaremos uma referência para ele e assim será possível manipulá-lo e clonar o template para que seja renderizado na página:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        h2 {
            color: blue;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dessa maneira, nosso componente é renderizado como antes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Y9Uqr_0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1x2yjzapmwgmcgmcjtz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1Y9Uqr_0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1x2yjzapmwgmcgmcjtz.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E o acesso, via JavaScript, ao &lt;code&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; continua retornando &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fgpGVsUa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bmqp405uzl595q2a0e01.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fgpGVsUa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bmqp405uzl595q2a0e01.png" alt="Console JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora temos nosso componente encapsulado e fechado para modificações externas com JavaScript. É evidente que ainda podemos acessá-lo da seguinte forma: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DSaxz2w4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2s753ehirnsc7ourackv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DSaxz2w4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2s753ehirnsc7ourackv.png" alt="Console JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mas, seguindo as boas práticas da linguagem, isso deve ser evitado já que indica que este atributo é privado e não deve ser acessado fora da classe &lt;code&gt;UserCard&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#isolando-o-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Isolando o CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escrever código CSS dentro de um &lt;em&gt;template string&lt;/em&gt; não é o ideal. O melhor seria se o código CSS de nosso componente ficasse em um arquivo externo de estilos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primeiro, vamos criar o arquivo &lt;code&gt;UserCard.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* arquivo UserCard.css */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Em seguida, modificamos nosso componente para utilizar este arquivo CSS - importando o arquivo através da tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;` 
    &amp;lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="UserCard.css"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// código omitido&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Também é possível utilizar o recurso de &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import"&gt;regra atribuída&lt;/a&gt; do CSS através do &lt;code&gt;@import&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;` 
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;@import url("UserCard.css")&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// código omitido&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;user-card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mas como comentado no &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM#internal_versus_external_styles"&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt;, o carregamento de um estilo externo feito dessa maneira dentro do &lt;code&gt;ShadowRoot&lt;/code&gt; pode causar o temido FOUC (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash of Unstyled Content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) - ou seja, pode ocorrer um &lt;em&gt;flash&lt;/em&gt; do conteúdo não estilizado enquanto o CSS é carregado. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por este motivo, muitos desenvolvedores mantêm o conteúdo dos estilos dentro da tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; no template &lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt; ao invés de tentar evitar FOUC com código adicional - até o momento não existe uma maneira fácil e rápida de evitar isso. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por facilidade e para evitar este tipo de problema, optaremos por manter o código de estilos dentro do template &lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt;, utilizando a tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finalizando-o-componente-do-cart%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finalizando o componente do cartão
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora que entendemos um pouco sobre componentes, podemos voltar ao nosso objetivo final que era criar o componente de cartão de usuários. Basta refatorarmos o código modificando o template de nosso componente e fazendo os ajustes em seu construtor. O código final ficaria assim:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- arquivo index.html --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Web Components&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;user-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Fulano de Tal"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;job=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Desenvolvedor de Software"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;image=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"user.png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/user-card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UserCard.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// arquivo UserCard.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;style&amp;gt;
        .card {
            font-family: Arial;
            border: 1px solid #c5c9d1;
            border-radius: 4%;
            width: 150px;
            height: 60px;
            display: flex;
            color: #5b6069;
            font-size: 12px;
            padding: 10px;
        }

        .card:hover {
            background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 97%);
        }

        .card-image,
        .card-content {
            padding: 5px;
        }

        .user-image {
            width: 45px;
            height: 45px;
        }

        .user-name {
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        .user-job {
            font-style: italic;
            font-size: 10px;
            margin-top: 2px;
        }
    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="card"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="card-image"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;img class="user-image" src="user.png"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="card-content"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="user-name"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="user-job"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;    
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;UserCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_job&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.user-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.user-job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_shadowRoot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.user-image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E temos como resultado o componente do cartão do usuário, podendo ser reutilizado em qualquer outra página HTML de nosso projeto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Csp5cpXH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6riys3ir39hw43luwpw8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Csp5cpXH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6riys3ir39hw43luwpw8.png" alt="Resultado da página renderizada"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclus%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusão
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; (componentes web) possui uma &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-components-intro-20130606/"&gt;especificação&lt;/a&gt; própria. Como descrito no &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/Web_Components"&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;é uma suíte de diferentes tecnologias que permite a criação de elementos customizados reutilizáveis — com a funcionalidade separada do resto do seu código — e que podem ser utilizados em suas aplicações web&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para utilizar &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; não é necessário nenhuma biblioteca adicional ou &lt;em&gt;framework&lt;/em&gt;, desde que o navegador implemente as seguintes especificações da Web Api:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Custom Elements&lt;/strong&gt; - permite definir tags customizadas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Templates&lt;/strong&gt; - permite definir blocos de códigos reutilizáveis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/strong&gt; - permite encapsular o código do componente em uma árvore separada do DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segundo a documentação, atualmente &lt;code&gt;Web Componentes&lt;/code&gt; é suportado por padrão no Firefox (versão 63), Chrome, Opera e Edge (versão 79). O Safari já suporta boa parte delas mas não todas. De todo modo, é possível usar &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; em qualquer navegador através do &lt;a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/webcomponentsjs"&gt;Polyfill&lt;/a&gt; - que nada mais é do que um pedaço de código (geralmente JavaScript) utilizado para simular os recursos ausentes do navegador o mais próximo possível.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; é ainda um conceito novo quando utilizado em  JavaScript nativo. Componentes são muito utilizados por bibliotecas e &lt;em&gt;frameworks&lt;/em&gt; como &lt;code&gt;Angular&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;React&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;Vue&lt;/code&gt; - ferramentas sólidas e muito famosas dentro da comunidade front-end. E &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt;, por ser nativo, pode ser utilizado juntamente com essas ferramentas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se considerarmos uma equipe grande, separada em vários times, em que cada time utiliza uma ferramenta diferente para cada parte de um projeto, pode acontecer de existir partes em comum entre elas como uma tela de login - com a mesma estrutura para dar unidade ao projeto. Com &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt;, é possível criar um componente nativo que seja compartilhado entre os times. Ou seja, facilita a interoperabilidade do sistema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um artigo interessante que compara &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; com demais ferramentas, levando em consideração estilos de código, performance e &lt;em&gt;bundle-size&lt;/em&gt;, é o &lt;a href="https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/"&gt;All the Ways to Make a Web Component&lt;/a&gt; do pessoal do &lt;a href="https://webcomponents.dev/"&gt;WebComponents.dev&lt;/a&gt;. Vale dar uma conferida!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No mais, a ideia deste post era apresentar conceitos básicos sobre &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; e como construir um simples componente com pouco código. &lt;code&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; vai muito além. Em futuros  posts desta série pretendo mostrar outros recursos como o ciclo de vida de um componente, registro de eventos, componentes compostos e como podemos gerenciar melhor o estado de seus atributos. Até a próxima!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to architecture state variables in React.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs, in this article, we will see how to architecture the state variables in your react app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a state is used by a single component it should be inside that component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a state is used by multiple components in a tree and they are all direct children of the same parent component, it should be in their parent component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a state is used by multiple components in a tree but they are not direct children of the same parent component, it should be in context/redux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a state is used by multiple components in different trees, it should be in context/redux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, for reading this far. I hope this article helped you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stretching body to full viewport height: the missing way</title>
      <author>Leonid Fenko</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:50:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fenok/stretching-body-to-full-viewport-height-the-missing-way-2ghd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fenok/stretching-body-to-full-viewport-height-the-missing-way-2ghd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you're making a sticky footer or centering some content relative to the viewport. You want to stretch the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element to the full height of the browser viewport while also letting it grow even further to match its content. This task was surely solved a bazillion times, and it should be as easy as pie. Right? &lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-stateoftheart-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The state-of-the-art way
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure! Applying &lt;code&gt;min-height: 100vh&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element should do the trick. Here, &lt;code&gt;100vh&lt;/code&gt; means that the initial &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; height will take 100% of the viewport height, whereas the use of &lt;code&gt;min-height&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; will let the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element grow even more if necessary. Isn't it exactly what we need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well... Almost. If we open such a page in a typical mobile browser (such as &lt;a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141832#c5"&gt;iOS Safari&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/url-bar-resizing"&gt;Android Chrome&lt;/a&gt;), it will be scrollable regardless of the size of its content. Even if the page has no content at all, its bottom will still disappear beneath the bottom UI panel of the browser!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is fairly simple. UI elements in these browsers shrink after the scroll, providing additional space for the actual content. A height of &lt;code&gt;100vh&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; possible viewport height. Since the initial viewport height is smaller, the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element with a &lt;code&gt;min-height&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;100vh&lt;/code&gt; initially exceeds the viewport height regardless of its content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i4QxFmws--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7l2in1hbz9p4lnupe8j2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i4QxFmws--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7l2in1hbz9p4lnupe8j2.png" alt="Mobile browser scroll demo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The known &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-fix-for-100vh-in-mobile-webkit/"&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; for this issue looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-webkit-fill-available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* We have to fix html height */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-webkit-fill-available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This solution has a minor glitch in Chrome: when the browser height increases, the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; height stays the same, getting out of sync with the viewport height. Aside from that, this approach solves the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we now have to fix the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; height. If that's the case, shouldn't we use an older, more robust solution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-oldschool-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The old-school way
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we couldn't avoid fixing the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; height, let's try the good old way that involves passing a height of 100% from the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's apply &lt;code&gt;min-height: 100%&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element, where 100% is the full height of its parent (namely, &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;). A percentage height on a child requires its parent to have a fixed height, so we have to apply &lt;code&gt;height: 100%&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element, thereby fixing its height to the full viewport height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the percentage height of the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element in mobile browsers is calculated relative to the &lt;em&gt;minimal&lt;/em&gt; viewport height, the above-mentioned scroll issue doesn't bug us anymore!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* We still have to fix html height */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This solution is not as pretty as the &lt;code&gt;100vh&lt;/code&gt; one, but it's been used since time immemorial, and it will work, that's for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well... Not quite. Apparently, the gradient applied to such a &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element will be cut at the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; height (in other words, at the viewport height, or, to be more precise, at the &lt;em&gt;minimal&lt;/em&gt; viewport height).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens because of the fixed &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; height, and it doesn't matter whether it's &lt;code&gt;height: 100%&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height: -webkit-fill-available&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ferGzAVJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7v5lon9jvr28guvgfr4t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ferGzAVJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7v5lon9jvr28guvgfr4t.png" alt="Broken gradient demo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this can be "fixed" by applying the gradient to the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; content, but that's just not &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. The page background &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be applied to the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element, and the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; stretch to its content. Can we achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-missing-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The missing way
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest another way of stretching the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element to the full viewport height without the above-mentioned issues. The core idea is to use flexbox, which enables a child element to stretch even to a parent with non-fixed dimensions while retaining the ability to grow further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we apply &lt;code&gt;min-height: 100%&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element to stretch it to the full &lt;em&gt;minimal&lt;/em&gt; viewport height. Then we use &lt;code&gt;display: flex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column&lt;/code&gt; to turn it into a flex-container with a vertical main axis. Finally, we apply &lt;code&gt;flex-grow: 1&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element, thereby stretching it to the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;align-self&lt;/code&gt; property of the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element implicitly has the &lt;code&gt;stretch&lt;/code&gt; value, so the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; width already matches the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; width.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* Look, it's not fixed anymore! */&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-grow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now both &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; can stretch to their content, and, since we're using the percentage height, there are no issues with mobile browsers whatsoever. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that the flexbox-based solution works for any depth. It can easily be used in cases where the content is being rendered to an element inside the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;, and not the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element itself. It's a typical scenario with &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/two-weird-tricks-that-fix-react-7cf9bbdef375"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#el"&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might've noticed, the direction of the main axis of the flex-container shouldn't matter. I just think that the vertical axis is more elegant in this case, and I didn't really test the other variant. I don't see how it can possibly break, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flexbox-based solution doesn't work in IE. Not at all. But you don't support it anyway, do you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Top 10 Git Commands Every Developer Should Know</title>
      <author>Muthu Annamalai Venkatachalam</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:16:04 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/muthuannamalai12/top-10-git-commands-every-developer-should-know-422l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone 👋,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is an important part of daily programming (especially if you're working with a team) and is widely used in the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are many various commands you can use, mastering Git takes time. But some commands are used more frequently (some daily). So in this post, I will share and explain the top 10 Git commands that every developer should know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Git Init&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The git init command is used to initialize a blank repository. It creates a .git folder in the current working directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git init &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will create an empty .git repository. Suppose we want to make a git repository on our desktop. To do so, open Git Bash on the desktop and run the above command. Consider the below output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BUyqtN5G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1l8yyc75q4r9nngpu1b8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BUyqtN5G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1l8yyc75q4r9nngpu1b8.jpg" alt="git init"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will create a new subdirectory named .git that holds all necessary repository files. The .git subdirectory can be understood as a Git repository skeleton. Consider the below image:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P4BQz-y---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o10qpv46t9zgayfsb3v3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P4BQz-y---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o10qpv46t9zgayfsb3v3.jpg" alt="git init 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An empty repository .git is added to my existing project. If we want to start version-controlling for existing files, we have to track these files with git add command, followed by a commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Git Commit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The git commit command is used to save the changes to the local repository. This command will help you keep a record of all the changes made. We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git commit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will prompt a default editor and ask for a commit message. We have made a change to newfile1.txt and want it to commit it. It can be done as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the below output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MJodbzof--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pmjfoqz13o093fnylp5r.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MJodbzof--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pmjfoqz13o093fnylp5r.jpg" alt="git commit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we run the command, it will prompt a default text editor and ask for a commit message. The text editor will look like as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3jpcQ_Eq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vlkc136dev0ye1qfm020.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3jpcQ_Eq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vlkc136dev0ye1qfm020.jpg" alt="git commit 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press the Esc key and after that 'I' for insert mode. Type a commit message whatever you want. Press Esc after that ':wq'  to save and exit from the editor. Hence, we have successfully made a commit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can check the commit by git log command. Consider the below output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mtic4T8t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x6b4put1kd2g0exmtxvh.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mtic4T8t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x6b4put1kd2g0exmtxvh.jpg" alt="git commit 3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see in the above output that log option is displaying commit-id, author detail, date and time, and the commit message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Git Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The git status command is used to display the state of the current repository &amp;amp; staging area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can gather information these information using git status command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i) Whether the current branch is up to date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii) Whether there is anything to commit, push or pull&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iii)Whether there are files staged, unstaged or untracked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iv) Whether there are files created, modified, or deleted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git status&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the below output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oCvYDm9O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iojyj5gpry08sdaqcvea.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oCvYDm9O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iojyj5gpry08sdaqcvea.jpg" alt="git status"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above output, the list of all untracked files is displayed by the git status command. We can track all the untracked files by Git Add command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Git Add&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit (unless we change the configurations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to use the git add command to include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a single file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git add &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the below output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jVs5UTF0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lfy6bbl71fzw4t6qshi9.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jVs5UTF0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lfy6bbl71fzw4t6qshi9.jpg" alt="git add 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above output, we can see newfile.txt has been added to our repository. Now, we have to commit it to share on Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add everything at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git add -A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git add .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JB8e9btn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ygpi3m51k7aqns5qbnee.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JB8e9btn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ygpi3m51k7aqns5qbnee.jpg" alt="git add 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above output, all the files are displaying as untracked files by Git. To track all of these files at once, run the below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git add -A &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will add all the files available in the repository. Consider the below scenario:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can either create four new files, or we can copy it, and then we add all these files at once. Consider the below output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OrVO9NVU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xf7l0s4ztignuw59ngkz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OrVO9NVU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xf7l0s4ztignuw59ngkz.jpg" alt="git add 3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above output, all the files have been added. The status of all files is displaying as staged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Git Merge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you've completed development in your branch and everything works fine, the final step is merging the branch with the parent branch (dev or master). This is done with the git merge command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The git merge command is used to integrate different branches into a single branch. It's important to remember that you first need to be on the specific branch that you want to merge with your feature branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git merge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lqldAKiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6foz6nf6qw09rd2b9r34.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lqldAKiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6foz6nf6qw09rd2b9r34.jpg" alt="git merge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Git Push&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git push -u origin &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SmNULqNm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f0itoih8fwvhdpglvwaf.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SmNULqNm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f0itoih8fwvhdpglvwaf.jpg" alt="git push 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file abc.jpg is successfully pushed to the origin master. We can track it in a  remote location. I have pushed these changes to my GitHub account. I can track it there in my repository. Consider the below image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8F5S4FVG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xpghbt10bg68khd7wyx5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8F5S4FVG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xpghbt10bg68khd7wyx5.jpg" alt="git pull 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above output, the pushed file abc.jpg is uploaded on my GitHub account's master branch repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Git Pull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The git pull command is used to get updates from the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git pull &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LcXZDnzb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l8ue3lhdnt9lvcfnq2r1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LcXZDnzb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l8ue3lhdnt9lvcfnq2r1.jpg" alt="git pull"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Git Clone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git clone &lt;a href="https://name-of-the-repository-link"&gt;https://name-of-the-repository-link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Pr4EPU6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8jel0d2fq5ent71vt7rp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8Pr4EPU6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8jel0d2fq5ent71vt7rp.jpg" alt="git clone"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Git branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branches are highly important in the git world. By using branches, several developers are able to work in parallel on the same project simultaneously. We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git branch   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ghC597ps--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h08n6hjb1asybxq6fck9.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ghC597ps--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h08n6hjb1asybxq6fck9.jpg" alt="git branch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command will create branch B1 locally in the Git directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Git Checkout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the most used Git commands. To work in a branch, first you need to switch to it. We use git checkout mostly for switching from one branch to another. We can also use it for checking out files and commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ git checkout  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the given output that master branch has switched to TestBranch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these are my 10 most-used git commands that I come across in my daily programming. I hope you find it useful. If yes then let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you got any question feel free to ping me on  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/muthuannamalai_"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now extend your support by buying me a Coffee.😊👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/muthuannamalai"&gt;Buy Me A Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Reading 😊 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom authentication in Ruby on Rails</title>
      <author>Abeid Ahmed</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:11:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/abeidahmed/custom-authentication-in-ruby-on-rails-5cbc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/abeidahmed/custom-authentication-in-ruby-on-rails-5cbc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was starting with Rails, I used to reach out to Devise every single time to handle the authentication. I thought myself to be a pro. You just need to install the &lt;code&gt;gem&lt;/code&gt; and run a few commands and there you have it. A working authentication system!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, I decided to build an invitation system, wherein the owner of the project could invite collaborators. To my surprise, there was a gem already, and that too, it was built for applications that were already using Devise. After fiddling with the gem, I realized that I was overriding most of the &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt;s just to get the functionality of the app that I desired. So after reading a handful of articles on authentication, I decided to build my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article assumes that you have some basic understanding of how Rails works, what cookies are, and how cookie signing works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-start-with-a-fresh-new-rails-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's start with a fresh new rails app
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails new custom-authentication &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; postgresql
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;custom-authentication
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-T&lt;/code&gt; flag tells rails that we do not want the default test framework. We'll use &lt;code&gt;RSpec&lt;/code&gt; to test our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-the-gems-that-we-need"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing the gems that we need
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"bcrypt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"~&amp;gt; 3.1.7"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"factory_bot_rails"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"~&amp;gt; 6.2"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rspec-rails"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"~&amp;gt; 5.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;gt;= 5.0.1"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"shoulda-matchers"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"~&amp;gt; 4.5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&amp;gt;= 4.5.1"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add these gems to your &lt;code&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; if you don't have it already. We'll not be discussing what these gems do. Try googling and I'll promise you that you'll learn more about those gems from their official documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-the-test-suite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up the test suite
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing the gems, run &lt;code&gt;rails g rspec:install&lt;/code&gt;. After successfully running the command, you should have the &lt;code&gt;spec&lt;/code&gt; directory at the root of your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new directory called &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;spec&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;code&gt;spec/support/factory_bot.rb&lt;/code&gt;, add these lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/support/factory_bot.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;FactoryBot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Syntax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;code&gt;spec/support/shoulda_matchers&lt;/code&gt;, add these lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/support/shoulda_matchers.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;Shoulda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Matchers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;integrate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_framework&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:rspec&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;library&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:rails&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are steps in setting up our test framework so that we can leverage the &lt;code&gt;method&lt;/code&gt;s that the gems provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now navigate to the &lt;code&gt;spec/rails_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt; and uncomment the line&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"spec/support/**/*.rb"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;which is usually found in line 27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-user-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a user model
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; model so that we can store the users credentials and later use them to authenticate the user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails g model user email:string:uniq password:digest auth_token:string:uniq
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should have similar to these lines of code on your &lt;code&gt;db/migrate/234235235_create_users.rb&lt;/code&gt;. Run &lt;code&gt;rails db:migrate&lt;/code&gt; after that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CreateUsers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ActiveRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Migration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;6.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;create_table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:password_digest&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;timestamps&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;add_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;unique: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;add_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;unique: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll use the &lt;code&gt;auth_token&lt;/code&gt; as a signed cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now navigate to &lt;code&gt;spec/factories/users.rb&lt;/code&gt; and let's set up the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; factory. In short, factories are a superset to the Rails fixtures.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/factories/users.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;FactoryBot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;factory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"janethebest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@example.com"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"secretpassword"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"secret_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, we'll write some specs so that in the future when we modify parts of code, we can be sure that our application still functions  as it's supposed to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/models/users_spec.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rails_helper"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;type: :model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"validations"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;have_secure_password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;validate_presence_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;validate_length_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_at_most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;validate_uniqueness_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;case_insensitive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"johndoe@example.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"johjn@exa.co.in"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;not_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;allow_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"johndoeexample.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"johjn@exa"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;validate_length_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_at_least&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"callbacks"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"normalizes the email before validation"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"   hello@example.com "&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;upcase&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;save!&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"hello@example.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"generates user auth_token at random"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;save!&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_present&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the tests, and it should fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;code&gt;app/models/user.rb&lt;/code&gt; and paste in those lines&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ApplicationRecord&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;VALID_EMAIL_REGEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-]+(\.[a-z\d\-]+)*\.[a-z]+\z/i&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;has_secure_password&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;has_secure_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;before_validation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:normalize_email&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;presence: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;length: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;maximum: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;uniqueness: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;case_sensitive: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;format: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;with: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;VALID_EMAIL_REGEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;presence: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;length: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;minimum: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;allow_blank: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kp"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;normalize_email&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;downcase&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the tests again, and it should all pass. In short, what we're doing is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to have a unique email address for every user and they should not be able to enter an invalid email address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to validate that the length of the password should at least be 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be stripping out the whitespaces from the email address that the user enters through the form, and we will also be lowercasing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you notice that we are passing &lt;code&gt;allow_blank: true&lt;/code&gt; on the password validation. If you are worrying that the user signing up will be able to set in nil or an empty string as their password, then do not. &lt;code&gt;bcrypt&lt;/code&gt; will automatically throw an error when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why we're doing that is to let the users not specify their password every single time they update their email address or their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is pretty much it for the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; model. Now let's move on to the &lt;code&gt;users_controller&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-raw-userscontroller-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a &lt;code&gt;UsersController&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;rails g controller users&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to the &lt;code&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;only: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sx"&gt;%i[create]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, let's add some &lt;code&gt;specs&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;users_controller&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/requests/users_spec.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rails_helper"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Users"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:valid_attributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"john@example.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"secretpass"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:invalid_attributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"john@example.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#create"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"when the request is valid"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"creates the user"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;users_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;params: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;user: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_attributes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"stores the auth_token in the cookie"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;users_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;params: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;user: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;valid_attributes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;signed_cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# You probably do not have the `signed_cookie` method&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"when the request is invalid"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns an error"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;users_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;params: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;user: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;invalid_attributes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;dig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_present&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# You also do not have the `json` method. Let's add them first&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;have_http_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:unprocessable_entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the tests, and you'll probably get an error saying that you do not have the &lt;code&gt;signed_cookie&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; method defined. Let's add them first.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/support/requests/sessions_helper.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Requests&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;SessionsHelper&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;signed_cookie&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="no"&gt;ActionDispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;CookieJar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;signed&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/support/json_helper.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;JsonHelper&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;symbolize_names: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's go to the &lt;code&gt;rails_helper.rb&lt;/code&gt; file and &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; these &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/rails_helper.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;JsonHelper&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SessionsHelper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After including the &lt;code&gt;module&lt;/code&gt;s, run the tests again and it should fail without complaining about the method not defined errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;app/controllers/users_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# app/controllers/users_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UsersController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;signed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;permanent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# you could also set an expiring cookie that would expire after a certain time.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do your thing. Redirect?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;json: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;errors: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;status: :unprocessable_entity&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kp"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;user_params&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;permit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, run the tests again and it should pass. We're done with signing up the user. Now let's focus on signing in the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#signing-in-the-user"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Signing in the user
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be creating a Plain Old Ruby Object (PORO) to handle the core logic of the authentication, like finding the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; record and verifying if the password entered is correct or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file &lt;code&gt;authentication.rb&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code&gt;app/models/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# app/models/authentication.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Authentication&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to_s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;downcase&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;find_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;authenticate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;authenticated?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;present?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's unit test this &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/models/authentication_spec.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rails_helper"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Authentication&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#user"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns the user if present"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;described_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns the user for case insensitive email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;described_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;upcase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns nil if user is not found"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;described_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid@email.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_nil&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns nil if user's credentials do not match"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_nil&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#authenticated?"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns true if user is found"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;described_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_authenticated&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"returns false if user is not found"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;described_class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid@email.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generating-the-raw-sessionscontroller-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generating the &lt;code&gt;SessionsController&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;rails g controller sessions&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to the &lt;code&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:sessions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;only: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sx"&gt;%i[create]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;spec/requests/sessions_spec.rb&lt;/code&gt; and let's write some specs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# spec/requests/sessions_spec.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"rails_helper"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="no"&gt;RSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Sessions"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;type: :request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"#create"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"when the request is valid"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"signs the user"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sessions_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;params: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;signed_cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"when the request is invalid"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"does not sign the user"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sessions_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;params: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"invalid@example.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;password: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"helloworld"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;signed_cookie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_nil&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;dig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:invalid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be_present&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;have_http_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:unprocessable_entity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the tests and it should fail. Let's get those specs passing!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SessionsController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ApplicationController&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Authentication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# remember this class?&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;authenticated?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;signed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;permanent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# do your thing. Redirect to some page?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;json: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;errors: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;invalid: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"credentials"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;status: :unprocessable_entity&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Run the tests again and it should all pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-the-heck-do-we-define-the-raw-currentuser-endraw-method-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How the heck do we define the &lt;code&gt;current_user&lt;/code&gt; method now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devise and other libraries provide us a handful of helper methods such as &lt;code&gt;current_user&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;authenticate_user&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll do this the new way. We'll be leveraging the &lt;code&gt;ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes&lt;/code&gt; class to make the authenticated user available globally. I know globals are controversial, but hey, why not for the sake of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file &lt;code&gt;current.rb&lt;/code&gt; within the &lt;code&gt;app/models/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# app/models/current.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ActiveSupport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;CurrentAttributes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now navigate to the &lt;code&gt;application_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; file and add these lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# app/controllers/application_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;before_action&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:set_current_user&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kp"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;set_current_user&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;Current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;find_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;auth_token: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cookies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;signed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, after every single request, the &lt;code&gt;set_current_user&lt;/code&gt; method will fire up and will try to set the &lt;code&gt;Current.user&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User signs up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cookie gets stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user gets redirected to another page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;set_current_user&lt;/code&gt; fires up and sets the &lt;code&gt;Current.user&lt;/code&gt; for you to be used in your app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-quick-note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A quick note
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;Current.user&lt;/code&gt; fires up in each request, please do not use it within your background jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. A fully working authentication system that you can customize to your needs. Although we did not write the &lt;code&gt;views&lt;/code&gt;, I assure you that it's pretty simple. Try fiddling with the system and you can come up with even better solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for now. Thank you for taking the time to read through. You rock!&lt;/p&gt;
