      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we are going to see a well curated list of angular interview questions 2021 and answers for experienced as well as freshers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 1 of this series :- &lt;a href="https://stacksjar.com/post/angular-interview-questions-part-1"&gt;Angular Interview Questions Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 2 of this series :- &lt;a href="https://stacksjar.com/post/angular-interview-questions-part-2"&gt;Angular Interview Questions Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part 3 of this series :- &lt;a href="https://stacksjar.com/post/angular-interview-questions-part-3"&gt;Angular Interview Questions Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-prioritize-typescript-over-javascript-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why prioritize TypeScript over JavaScript in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug. TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand. With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more benefits of TypeScript over Javascript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistency&lt;br&gt;
Productivity&lt;br&gt;
Maintainability&lt;br&gt;
Modularity&lt;br&gt;
Catch Errors Early&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-bootstrapping-module-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Bootstrapping module in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping in Angular is a function component in the core ng module that is used for starting up the Angular application. By default the Appcomponent is the default component that will be bootstraped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the Default code for bootstrapping an angular application in app.module.ts&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,

    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        AppRoutingModule,
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent],
    schemas: []
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-pure-and-impure-pipe-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the difference between Pure and Impure pipe in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pure Pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Impure Pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameter(s) changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of pipe and its decorator for setting pipe type&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Pipe({
 name: 'myCustomPipe', 
 pure: true    // true means this is a Pure Pipe and false means its and Impure Pipe (default is true)
})

export class MyCustomPipe {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-rxjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is RxJS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full form of RxJS is Reactive Extension for Javascript. It is a javascript library that uses observables to work with reactive programming that deals with asynchronous data calls, callbacks and event-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RxJS is a library for reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. RxJS can be used with any other Javascript libraries and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-observable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an observable?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observables are simply a function that are able to give multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously. You can also consider Observables as lazy Push collections of multiple values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observables provide support for passing messages between parts of your application. They are used frequently in Angular and are a technique for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can subscribe to an observable and get values synchronously or asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of how to create and Observable:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var observable = Rx.Observable.create((observer: any) =&amp;gt;{

   observer.next("This is an Observable");

})

observable.subscribe((data)=&amp;gt;{
   console.log(data);    // output - "This is an Observable"
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-observer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an observer?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers are just objects with three callbacks, one for each type of notification that an Observable may deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Observer is a consumer of values delivered by an Observable. Observers are simply a set of callbacks, one for each type of notification delivered by the Observable: next , error , and complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of Observer and values retrieved after being Subscribed to it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const observer = {
 next: x =&amp;gt; console.log('This is next value: ' + x),
 error: err =&amp;gt; console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
};

observable.subscribe(observer);

//OR

observable.subscribe(observer =&amp;gt; {
  observer.next(10);
  observer.error("something went wrong");  
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-angular-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Angular Elements?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements (also called Web Components), a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A custom element extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code. The browser maintains a CustomElementRegistry of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Example of Angular Elements :- Angular Elements Working Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The custom elements standard is currently supported by browsers like Chrome, Opera, and Safari. To be able to use it Firefox and Edge polyfills are available. The Angular Elements functionality is available with the package @angular/elements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep track of all available custom elements the browser maintains a registry in which every elements needs to be registered first. In this registry the name of the tag is mapped to the JavaScript class which controls the behavior and the output of that element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-angular-universal-or-angular-ssr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Angular Universal or Angular SSR?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular Universal is mechanism provided by Angular team by which you can render your single page angular application on server instead of Browser. Typical Angular applications are Single-Page Applications (aka SPA's) where the rendering occurs on the Browser. This process can also be referred to as client-side rendering (CSR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular Universal is a very helpful and SEO friendly approach for modern web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Angular Universal provides 2 options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Server Side Rendering : In this method the requested page will be completely rendered on server and send to the browser&lt;br&gt;
Pre-Rendering : In this method you have to provide a list of routes you want to pre-render then by using the pre rendering command and the routes mentioned it will complete the Build with fully rendered HTML pages&lt;br&gt;
To add Angular Universal to your project use below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng add @nguniversal/express-engine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-service-workers-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Service Workers in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service Worker in Angular is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application. Service workers function as a network proxy. They intercept all outgoing HTTP requests made by the application and can choose how to respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service Workers helps in improving your application's performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add Service Workers in your Angular application use below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng add @angular/pwa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkout this Article: It covers complete Steps to Add Service Worker in Angular Application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-lazy-loading-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Lazy Loading in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy Loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated. It improves the speed of the application load time by splitting the application into several bundles. When the user navigates through the app, the bundles are loaded as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of loading the entire web page and rendering it to the user in one go as in bulk loading, the concept of lazy loading assists in loading only the required section and delays the remaining, until it is needed by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example route for a lazy loaded module:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
  {path: 'home', component: HomeComponent},
  {path: 'lazy', loadChildren: './lazy/lazy.module#LazyModule'}
];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-shared-module-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a Shared Module in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared modules in Angular helps you write more organized code in less time, helping you be more productive. Shared modules are an ideal spot to declare components in order to make them reusable. You won’t have to re-import the same components in every module—you’ll just import the shared module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating shared modules allows you to organize and streamline your code. You can put commonly used directives, pipes, and components into one module and then import just that module wherever you need it in other parts of your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of a Shared Module:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;﻿import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";

import { SharedRoutingModule } from "./shared-routing.module";
import { SharedComponent } from "./components/shared/shared.component";

@NgModule({
 declarations: [SharedComponent],
 imports: [CommonModule, SharedRoutingModule],
 exports: [SharedComponent]
})

export class SharedModule {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-dom-sanitizer-in-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is DOM Sanitizer in Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dom Sanitizer in Angular helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the different methods Provided by Angular for Sanitization and make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//default sanitize data
abstract sanitize(context: SecurityContext, value: string | SafeValue): string | null

//sanitize html
abstract bypassSecurityTrustHtml(value: string): SafeHtml

//sanitize css
abstract bypassSecurityTrustStyle(value: string): SafeStyle

//sanitize scripts
abstract bypassSecurityTrustScript(value: string): SafeScript

//sanitize url
abstract bypassSecurityTrustUrl(value: string): SafeUrl

//sanitize resource urls
abstract bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(value: string): SafeResourceUrl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-reasons-for-ai-implementation-in-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 reasons for AI implementation in healthcare
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you can find 5 reasons to implement AI in the healthcare industry. These solutions help doctors work more productively, improve processes and clinical outcomes. These are also 5 reasons that indicate that AI technology in healthcare is gaining popularity and is a potential source of major investments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1robotassisted-surgery"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.Robot-assisted surgery
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotic or robot-assisted surgery allows doctors to perform many types of complex procedures with greater precision, flexibility, and control than is possible with traditional methods. Surgeons using an AI-based robotic system believe that, for many procedures, it improves accuracy, flexibility and control during surgery, and allows them to see the surgery site better than traditional methods. &lt;br&gt;
Robotic surgery offers patients many benefits to open surgery, including:&lt;br&gt;
👉Shorter hospitalization&lt;br&gt;
👉Reduced pain and discomfort&lt;br&gt;
👉Faster recovery time and return to normal activities&lt;br&gt;
👉Smaller incisions that reduce the risk of infection&lt;br&gt;
👉Reduced blood loss and transfusions&lt;br&gt;
👉Minimal scars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2chatbots-amp-mobile-apps-for-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2.Chatbots &amp;amp; Mobile Apps for healthcare
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital health and wellness market is valued at over $106 billion in 2019, according to a recent Global Market Insights report. And with the global pandemic in 2020 that increases the demand for digital health technologies, the industry is expected to continue to grow 28.5% by 2026. [1] &lt;br&gt;
💡The AI healthcare market is predicted to exceed $34 billion by 2025.[1] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence is useful in diagnostics, therapy and customer service through intelligent applications. Chatbots are by far the most popular AI application. What's more, the adoption of chatbots in organizations is growing year by year, and the chatbot market is expected to reach over USD 300 million by 2023. [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of medical applications has played an important role in providing patients with quick information. Using mobile apps for healthcare, you can find a doctor, make an appointment and view all test reports without leaving your home. Mobile applications not only help patients, but also allows doctors to seamlessly collect and store personal health data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3aipowered-alerting-systems-amp-virtual-assistants"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3.AI-powered alerting systems &amp;amp; Virtual assistants
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, more and more AI solutions are implemented to support the transition from inpatient to home care, such as remote monitoring, AI alarm systems or virtual assistants. These technologies include the increased use of NLP solutions in hospitals and at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence systems make it easier for virtual nursing assistants to perform a wide range of tasks, from communicating with patients to sending them to a better and more efficient healthcare facility. Such virtual nurses are available 24/7 and can answer questions as well as monitor patients and provide immediate solutions. Nowadays, AI technology is also used in a wider range of specialties, such as oncology, cardiology and neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4improved-data-processing-for-diagnosis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4.Improved data processing for diagnosis
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of AI is the processing of large amounts of data, which allows AI to change various medical devices. For example, one NIH study that used artificial intelligence to diagnose metastatic breast cancer found the technology to be 99% accurate. [2] It has also been shown that artificial intelligence is capable of detecting the spread of cancer cells - micrometastases - which are usually very difficult to detect by specialist human pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5enhanced-drug-development-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5.Enhanced drug development process
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of new drugs also requires processing of large amounts of data due to the enormous number of possibilities for chemical combinations. The solution is AI technology, which works amazingly well with large amounts of data. This ability enables more approved drugs to be produced in a faster, more cost-effective process with higher R&amp;amp;D efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By implementing &lt;a href="https://addepto.com/artificial-intelligence-in-drug-discovery-with-machine-learning/"&gt;AI into the drug development process&lt;/a&gt;, this technology has great potential to identify the most promising developments in the research process, helping to save time and resources at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-predictions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future Predictions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI technology is developing at an incredible pace, so below you can find 3 future predictions about AI in healthcare industry: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👩‍🔬 VR and AR promise to be very useful in the healthcare industry. It is believed that using VR to train healthcare workers improves skill retention by 75% and reduces skill loss by up to 52%. [3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🧬 AI-powered predictive care: In 2030 health systems can predict when a person is at risk of a chronic disease, for example, and propose preventive measures before they get worse. [4] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👨‍🔬 The future of AI will be based in predicting future diseases, their origins and the spread of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-takeaways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Takeaways

      <title>Hanlon's razor, a great tool to be more positive </title>
      <author>Jelle Smeets</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 09:33:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/hanlon-s-razor-a-great-tool-to-be-more-positive-368l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/hanlon-s-razor-a-great-tool-to-be-more-positive-368l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my professional career, I have come across several tools to help you get the correct mindset. Hanlon's razor is one of those. In a difficult negative situation in one of my teams, I discovered Hanlon's razor and I have used it ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will take a look at what exactly a razor is, and how you can use Hanlon's razor to your benefit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-razor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a razor?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the school of philosophy, a razor is used as a principle or rule of thumb to eliminate or shave off explanations for a situation. Philosophers, scientists, and other great people have used Razors in their mental models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most know razors is Occam's razor. Which states that "&lt;em&gt;the simplest explanation is usually the best one.&lt;/em&gt;". There are more Razors: Hitchen's, Alder's but let's take a look at the one that had the biggest impact on my life: Hanlon's razor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hanlons-razor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hanlon's Razor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanlon's razor is likely named after John Hanlon who submitted the statement to a joke book. It has been used by several important people in history. Napoleon, Winston Churchill, Jane West, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several small variations of Hanlon's razor, my favorite one was spoken by Napoleon Bonaparte and goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cYTXDmSA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zjltm00m6r29vg83j2hl.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cYTXDmSA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zjltm00m6r29vg83j2hl.jpg" alt="Napoleon Bonaparte"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napoleon said it first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte in 1774&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Hanlon's razor by not assuming there is malice, but trying to find an explanation that is more plausible. There are usually better explanations than "this person is out here to hurt me".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-to-day-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day to day use
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Scrum master, I have interactions with all layers of the business. Other development teams, the management team, stakeholders. They all make decisions based on their own knowledge and opinions. In your career, there will be decisions that will have a negative impact on you or your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it can be easy to think someone's intent has malice. For example, another development team has made a decision in their architecture that really negatively impacts your team. It might be easy to reach the conclusion they have just done it on purpose because they just don't care about other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Hanlon's razor, you can take a look at the different sides of the same coin. Try to take a look at the decision from their side. Are they really there to hurt your team? Or can this be explained by "incompetence". The other team might not know this impacts you, they might have thought of it and there are other things that are more important, etc. I have learned over the years this kind of situation almost never comes down to malice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing that there usually is no ill intent in this kind of situation really helps me to stay positive. Other people or teams are not out there to hurt you on purpose. Instead of staying in this negative mindset "I can't believe they did this", you can focus your energy on the things that matter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Hanlon's razor? Can you use it in your day-to-day work? Let me know in the comments down below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Increase my Productivity</title>
      <author>Harshit paliwal</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 09:32:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/harshitpaliwal95/how-i-increase-my-productivity-ga6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/harshitpaliwal95/how-i-increase-my-productivity-ga6</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;You are here means you want you can improve your productivity too I can help you but first thing first. &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let us talk about productivity first.&lt;br&gt;
In simple words, productivity is a way to measure efficiency. you might know that already&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now to improve productivity &lt;br&gt;
I don’t want to lecture you about do this that but since I followed these things in my life I feel like how shorted life is the thing only we need is to go with the flow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prepare your morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, prepare your morning it doesn't mean wake up early at 4 am do work out take bath, and get back to work at 5:30 am 😂if you follow this routine then awesome it is cool you are a superhuman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for a normal human like me I have an advice for you I know we sleep late at night because of study learning coding and some personal stuff it is okay &lt;b&gt;👊🏻wake up early &amp;lt; complete sleep&lt;/b&gt; so chill out no need to wake up at 4 or 5 &lt;br&gt;
just need to make a fixed time if you like 6 it is okay if you like 7 it is okay, just make a routine&lt;br&gt;
Discipline is the only thing that can make you a real person tho,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wake up in morning time as you like but fix the time you can wake up at that time totally after you decide &lt;br&gt;
do workout take a bath and done,&lt;br&gt;
your 1st hr of the day is only for yourself not for your boss/teacher/parents.&lt;br&gt;
Here is complete step one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prepare your surroundings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey!! 😂 surroundings I don't mean you wake up your sibling's parents early in the morning, &lt;br&gt;
What I mean is fix the thing you messed up it can be your bed your room check your desktop there might be useless folders everywhere 😂 ya I m serious fix everything that looks messed up the reason behind this is the atmosphere of your workstation room everything you see it can reflect in your mind too you don’t want to mess up your mind right then fix it now and see the change how you feeling after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Go with flow &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go with flow my friend don’t try every new thing you heard in a single day it might work or might not but after trying different things can decrease your will. no need to push your self no need to stop either be on the skateboard you can control and keep moving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing is discipline is the only thing that can make you a real person I don’t want to sound like some old principle but it is the true start to be in discipline it can help you in many other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad if this post helps you even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nebula Operator Kind, oneliner installer for Nebula K8s Operator Playground</title>
      <author>lisahui</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 08:54:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lisahui/nebula-operator-kind-oneliner-installer-for-nebula-k8s-operator-playground-27k8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lisahui/nebula-operator-kind-oneliner-installer-for-nebula-k8s-operator-playground-27k8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nebula-Kind, an one-liner command to try K8s Operator based Nebula Graph Cluster on your machine, with the help of KIND (K8s in Docker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nebulaoperatorkind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nebula-Operator-Kind
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Cloud Native Distributed Database, Nebula Graph comes with an open-source K8s Operator to enable boostrap and maintain Nebula Graph Cluster from a K8s CRD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally it takes you some time to setup all the dependencies and control plane resources of the Nebula Operator. If you are as lazy as I am, this Nebula-Operator-Kind is made for you to quick start and play with Nebula Graph in KIND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nebula-Operator-Kind is the one-liner for setup everything for you including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker&lt;br&gt;
K8s(KIND)&lt;br&gt;
PV Provider&lt;br&gt;
Nebula-Operator&lt;br&gt;
Nebula-Console&lt;br&gt;
nodePort for accessing the Cluster&lt;br&gt;
Kubectl for playing with KIND and Nebula Operator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How To Use
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install Nebula-Operator-Kind:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install.sh | bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will see this after it’s done&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bCI17jSy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://siwei.io/en/nebula-operator-kind/install_success.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bCI17jSy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://siwei.io/en/nebula-operator-kind/install_success.webp" alt="alt text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can connect to the cluster via ~/.nebula-kind/bin/console as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.nebula-kind/bin/console -u user -p password --address=127.0.0.1 --port=30000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in GitHub with more information you may be intrested in ;-), please try and feedback there~ &lt;a href="https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-operator-kind"&gt;https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-operator-kind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install on KubeSphere all-in-on cluster：&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install-ks-1.sh | bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install on existing K8s cluster:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install-on-k8s.sh | bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Val - Powerful Static and Dynamic programming language</title>
      <author>alkaemy</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 08:46:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alkaemy/val-powerful-static-and-dynamic-programming-language-3go2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alkaemy/val-powerful-static-and-dynamic-programming-language-3go2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi All!,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working on a radically new programming language called &lt;strong&gt;Val&lt;/strong&gt; for a couple of months now.&lt;br&gt;
Val language is a static language with a compile-time dynamic language called &lt;strong&gt;Valet&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Think writing Python/Ruby/JS to generate C/Rust for quickly building Web, AI, Data-Intensive, and Low-Level applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentation is here to give you a glimpse of Val. &lt;br&gt;
We are looking to raise funds for our funding platform, and we need to clarify some points before publishing the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at the beginning of our journey. Feedbacks, ideas, suggestions are highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out at &lt;a href="//www.val-lang.org"&gt;Val&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//www.reddit.com/r/vallang"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//www.github.com/alkaemy/val-lang"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vallanguage"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web Animation with CSS - Animation Property</title>
      <author>Suraj Vishwakarma</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 08:45:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/basecampxd/web-animation-with-css-animation-property-bdb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/basecampxd/web-animation-with-css-animation-property-bdb</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the series of &lt;strong&gt;Web Animation with CSS&lt;/strong&gt;. Today we are going to learn more about animation using CSS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of the series paved the way to start animating in web pages for beginners. You can read &lt;a href="https://dev.to/basecampxd/web-animation-with-css-2c5d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's get started with today's topic.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#animation-direction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Animation Direction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests this property is used to alter the direction of animation. It has four values &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;alternate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;alternate-reverse&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codepen-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Codepen Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/surajsrv11/embed/BaZGYGj?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, I have used the &lt;code&gt;animation-direction&lt;/code&gt; with the value &lt;code&gt;alternate&lt;/code&gt;. The animation first started as normal and for 2nd time it reversed. This happens alternately once &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt; and other times &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;. It becomes a sequence of animation looping again and again.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#animation-timing-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Animation Timing Function
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation timing function helps you to control the animation speed curve. This curve defines the speed of animation transition at the different time frames. This curve helps you to make the transition smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-timing-function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codepen-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CodePen Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/surajsrv11/embed/MWoxKpq?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above Codepen, the ball is moving from top to bottom. The animation is not linear as the speed of transition changes. We have used &lt;code&gt;animation-timing-function&lt;/code&gt; with the value &lt;code&gt;ease&lt;/code&gt;. Using &lt;code&gt;ease&lt;/code&gt; value the animation has a slow start and end but fast in between slow and end. There is various value to animation timing function, you can learn more about it &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-timing-function.asp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such value of the animation-timing function is &lt;code&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/code&gt;. It let you create your timing function to control your animation. It takes 4 numeric values between 0 and 1. You can visit &lt;a href="https://cubic-bezier.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cubic Bezier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create your animation timing function.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;

  Animation Shorthand
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till now we have used lot of animation property to define animation such as &lt;code&gt;animation-direction&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;animation-delay&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;animation-timing-function&lt;/code&gt;, etc. You can use shorthand technique to define all animation related property into single property that is &lt;code&gt;animation&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bounce&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#codepen-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
