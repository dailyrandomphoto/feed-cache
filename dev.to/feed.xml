      <title>Images are hard. Is there a simpler way?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using images on the web is deceptively complicated. To give simple, concise advice on the best way to use images on the web is tricky. We all would like to avoid creating bulky, slow webpages but it is a battle sometimes. Images are at the forefront of that battle, because they typically make up 50% of a page's weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best coverage of images I read is a 10-part series by Jason Grigsby from 2015 called &lt;a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-definitions/"&gt;Responsive Images 101&lt;/a&gt;, which provided a thorough tutorial on responsive images, it is dated in some respects but stil worth a read. Also, Jason wrote an article in 2013 called &lt;a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/8-guidelines-and-1-rule-for-responsive-images/"&gt;8 Guidelines and 1 Rule for Responsive Images&lt;/a&gt; that provides some guidelines. I haven't seen a worthy, up-to-date predecessor to either of these articles. Even MDN's &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images"&gt;guide to responsive images&lt;/a&gt; defers to Jason's 2015 article on background images and media queries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting images on the web is not just about making them responsive, there are other design and implementation considerations. There have been new developments in responsive design, which has led to some people heralding the beginning of the '&lt;a href="https://una.im/2021/05/26/new-responsive/"&gt;new responsive era&lt;/a&gt;'. I wouldn't get too caught up in that, but maybe it is a time to reassess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue for me right now is that things are convoluted, and we should be looking for a simpler way. There isn't a good set of guidelines for dealing with images in a holistic manner. We are reaching for tools to whisk some of the complication away instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd like to discuss some of these issues, and provide &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of that missing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-doth-the-difficulty-lie"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where doth the difficulty lie?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different considerations with images. You bump into a heap of questions when you're using images such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the difference between the image formats? Which should I use and when? What is the browser support like now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I load images in the most performant manner? Should I preload some images? Should I use lazy loading everywhere? Do I need to use JavaScript for lazy loading? What about that new &lt;code&gt;content-visibility&lt;/code&gt; property?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about optimization? What sizes do I use? How do I automate the process? Addy Osmani wrote &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/image-optimization/"&gt;a whole book&lt;/a&gt; on image optimization recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I do to make images accessible? Do I use an &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute on all images?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I do with background images? Can I make them responsive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Coyier also discussed this topic in his recent article &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/images-are-hard/"&gt;Images are hard&lt;/a&gt; and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting images on websites is incredibly simple, yes? Actually, yes, it is. You use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and link it to a valid source in the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute and you’re done. Except that there are (counts fingers) 927 things you could (and some you really should) do that often go overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris goes on to list approximately 20 of these things. There are some bits that come to my mind also that Chris did not mention. I'm not going to make a complete list. It's too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me sad that things are like this. There have been improvements in some areas, better tooling is available to cover some of it, but some of it is impractical. I imagine it would feel overwhelming for someone who wants to build a website who is not a web developer but would like to; or a beginner who wants to do things the "right way". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should reassure people that it is OK to just use an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with one appropriately sized image when you are starting out. Your website will work fine. You are breaking no laws. You can learn more and improve on this later. As I discuss later, many of us are pretty loose with how we use images anyway, so he who has not sinned should cast the first stone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I say this because it seems to me that that there is more pressure to make everything fast now. Web performance is being hyped up. People are talking more about Lighthouse scores. The marketing guys are linking improvements in performance to revenue gains. And there is the spectre of SEO-reaper lurking. 👻 SEO rankings are inexplicably being linked to performance now through Google's core web vital metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, but...I just want to build a small, fan site for BTS! 😢 Maybe that's why some people prefer to build discord bots instead of websites now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, there isn't a cohesive and clear narrative on how to do things well. It's an accumulation of stuff that is not synthesized well. I think it's important to look at what people are actually doing, rather than what people are saying or suggesting to cut through the rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rereading Jason's article on &lt;a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/8-guidelines-and-1-rule-for-responsive-images/"&gt;guidelines from 2013&lt;/a&gt;, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knows what the future of responsive images holds. A few years from now, we will probably look back on the hacks we’re using and laugh at our naivety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still waiting for holographic personal devices. Where's the 3D CSS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-are-images-really-used-on-the-web"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How are images really used on the web
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the &lt;a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/"&gt;Web Almanac&lt;/a&gt; to see what is really happening. The &lt;a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/"&gt;Web Almanac&lt;/a&gt; is an annual report which  "combines the raw stats and trends of the HTTP Archive with the expertise of the web community."  Let's look at last year's report with regard to images and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the median page weighted approximately 2 MB for desktop and 1.9 MB for mobile, and a shocking 7.4 MB for desktop and 6.7 MB for mobile at the 90th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--syyY1mOS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oo43riyr1ub4lway2mqe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--syyY1mOS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oo43riyr1ub4lway2mqe.png" alt="page weight distribution bar chart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median page weight contains approxmiately 1 MB of images and approximately 400 KB of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ItWMLpJi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wqq3coi3ljy5ffaqqy12.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ItWMLpJi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wqq3coi3ljy5ffaqqy12.png" alt="show the weight content types on a bar chart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why people point at images as the lowest hanging fruit for reducing page weight. Images are still the most requested type of resource, though JavaScript is closing in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is it's not just the size of the resources. It's the amount of requested resources. This is the distribution of requests by content type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gN9TtY4m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6d8ko59lxym5shzaea02.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gN9TtY4m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6d8ko59lxym5shzaea02.png" alt="show distribution of request types on a barchart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers seem bonkers to me. It is common to have 29 images on 1 page! The number of requests on desktop for the media page is the same &lt;a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/page-weight#page-requests"&gt;as last year&lt;/a&gt; (74), yet the page weight has increased by 122 KB. Pages are getting bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of &lt;a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/performance"&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt;, it is hard to summarise. This is the &lt;a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/performance#conclusion"&gt;most succinct summary directly from the report&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, we have seen optimistic signals about the new Core Web Vitals performance metrics. At least half of the experiences are good across both desktop and mobile devices, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we don’t narrow down to consistently poor experiences on slower networks for Largest Contentful Paint. While the newer metrics might suggest that there’s an ongoing uptake in addressing performance issues, the lack of significant improvements in First Contentful Paint and Time to First Byte is sobering. Here the same network types are most disadvantaged as with Largest Contentful Paint, as well as fast connections and desktop devices. The Performance Score also portrays a decline in speed (or  perhaps, a more accurate portrayal than what we measured in the past).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the data shows us, is that we must keep investing in improving  performance for scenarios (such as slower connectivity) that we often  don’t experience due to multiple aspects of our privilege (middle to  high-income countries, high pay and new, capable devices). It also highlights that there’s still plenty of work to be done in the areas of speeding up initial paints (LCP and FCP) and asset delivery (TTFB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's just say there is room for improvement! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-would-you-recommend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What would you recommend?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the basic things well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-ship-less-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1) Ship less images!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't serve 29 images for your average webpage. This article has 8 images. Show restraint, be selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think of this quote from Dickens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subdue your appetites, my dears, and you've conquered human nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-inline-svg-icons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2) Inline SVG icons
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pasting SVG icons into your HTML will reduce the amount of requests. In the age of static site generators and web components, it is easier to do this in one place and avoid duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-use-a-ruleofthumb-to-set-the-maximum-image-resolution-for-your-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3) Use a rule-of-thumb to set the maximum image resolution for your images
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pick the maximum image size for your page based on its content. For example, if you have a blog and the maximum width of your blog post is 700px, then serve images with a maximum width of 1400px. This will cover high-resolution screens with 2x pixel density. Jake Archibald mentions this as the "lazy way" in his article &lt;a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2021/serving-sharp-images-to-high-density-screens/#the-lazy-way"&gt;Halve the size of images by optimizing for high density displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xrV_MTym--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b03fo2dxjo3cy3n62vkr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xrV_MTym--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b03fo2dxjo3cy3n62vkr.png" alt="show example of blog post with width on desktop and highlight max width of image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-provide-alternative-text"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4) Provide alternative text
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of accessibility, give a text alternative for an image in the &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute. You should add alt text to most images, unless it is considered decorative. Eric Bailey discusses when you can skip altnerative text in the article - &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/img-alt-attribute-alternate-description-decorative/"&gt;Your Image Is Probably Not Decorative&lt;/a&gt;. Spoiler altert: it's not that often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-stick-to-using-one-image-format-with-raw-img-endraw-if-you-are-inexperienced"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5) Stick to using one image format with &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; if you are inexperienced
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a beginner, I would suggest sticking with a single image format with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You don't need to learn a static site generator or JavaScript to get started making websites (but it will make it easier in the longer-run). Use JPEG for photos, and use either a PNG or SVG (preferably) for more graphical images such as icons and diagrams. Maybe next year, you can start using WEBP instead of JPEG and PNG. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webp"&gt;WEBP is only partially supported in Safari&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I follow this recommendation for this page, I use 8 images in the article totaling 169.5 KB. I did run 2 images through &lt;a href="https://squoosh.app/"&gt;squoosh&lt;/a&gt; to reduce their size. That's already quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-set-dimensions-for-images-to-reduce-layout-shifts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6) Set dimensions for images to reduce layout shifts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define the dimensions of images through the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; attributes, or in CSS with some combination of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aspect-ratio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;. This will prevent parts of your page moving around when an image loads. This is called &lt;a href="https://web.dev/cls/"&gt;cumulative layout shift (CLS)&lt;/a&gt; and is one of Google's &lt;a href="https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals"&gt;core web vitals metrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to use &lt;code&gt;aspect-ratio&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; for some images, but &lt;code&gt;aspect-ratio&lt;/code&gt; has only just made it to Safari. So, now it is &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio"&gt;in all major browsers&lt;/a&gt;, just keep this in mind if browser support is an issue for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the ins-and-outs of this, you can read the article - &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/setting-height-width-images-important-again/"&gt;Setting Height And Width On Images Is Important Again&lt;/a&gt;. It's a 17 min read, yowzer! 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-lazy-load-images-below-the-fold"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7) Lazy load images below the fold
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any images below the fold, by below the fold I mean any image that would not be seen when the page is loaded, you can lazy load these images. This will defer loading of images that are off-screen until the user scrolls near them . You can do this by adding this attribute &lt;code&gt;loading="lazy"&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attribute is &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=lazy"&gt;supported in 74.71% of browsers now&lt;/a&gt;, but looking at the most recent data (Jan - Jun 2021) on the HTTP Archive, &lt;a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images?start=2020_01_01&amp;amp;end=2021_06_01#imgLazy"&gt;it is used by just 17% of websites&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I add lazy-loading to this page, only the the main image needs to be loaded, that's just 2.1 KB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-learn-the-basics-of-svg-and-use-svg-for-graphical-images-as-often-as-you-can"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8) Learn the basics of SVG and use SVG for graphical images as often as you can
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend that you learn the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG"&gt;basics of SVG&lt;/a&gt;. Using SVG instead of PNG is an easy win. Since SVG is a text-based &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics"&gt;vector format&lt;/a&gt;, files can be very small. For example, the main image for this article is a SVG and is 2.1 KB. SVGs can scale up and down without any loss of quality. Effectively, you can have 1 image that looks good on any screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cmarz6h4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ngbx8x2ajy061stimxbg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cmarz6h4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ngbx8x2ajy061stimxbg.png" alt="demonstrating visaul difference between raster and vector images scaled up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-optimize-your-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9) Optimize your images
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use a web app like &lt;a href="https://tinypng.com/"&gt;tinypng&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://squoosh.app/"&gt;squoosh&lt;/a&gt; to resize and reduce the file size of your images. You can use &lt;a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/"&gt;SVGOMG&lt;/a&gt; for SVGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I would only to need to optimize 2 PNGs for this post. The rest were not that big or wide. In any case, I can drop them all into tinypng and get an optimized set in a zip. If you don't use a lot of images, then this is a quick process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will discuss automation of this in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you do this much, you will be ahead of the median website. Test your website in your favourite auditing tool (such as &lt;a href="https://webpagetest.org/"&gt;Webpagetest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;) to see where you're at. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the steps above for this post and got 99/100 for performance in &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"&gt;PageSpeed Insights&lt;/a&gt;, check it out for yourself: &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboleary.net%2F2021%2F07%2F29%2Fsimpler-images.html"&gt;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboleary.net%2F2021%2F07%2F29%2Fsimpler-images.html&lt;/a&gt;. When loaded for the first time, the initial page weight is 80.2 KB, it is 5.5 KB when requested a second time (with caching). This score reflects other implementation decisions I made, but you can see that images ain't an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at what browsers you need to support to see if you need to polyfill the &lt;code&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, you are getting into more technical territory, but through automation you can take some of the work off your plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-extra-yards-and-automation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The extra yards and automation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next biggest win is to use different versions of images for different screen sizes (&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#resolution_switching_different_sizes"&gt;resolution switching&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#use_modern_image_formats_boldly"&gt;next-gen formats for browsers that support them&lt;/a&gt;. You can choose to do-it-yourself or &lt;a href="https://theguidex.com/best-image-cdn-providers/"&gt;use an Image CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a small website, a manual process is manageable. Just find a GUI app or command-line tool, whatever you are comfortable with, one that will give do bulk resizing and optimization of your images for you. You just want to point to a folder and have it spit out all of the alternative versions for you. You can add the markup to your page yourself, albeit this can become a bit tedious. You can automate the insertion of this markup with some tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use a static-site generator or a backend platform like Wordpress, there are integrated options to do this for you such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/"&gt;Eleventy Image&lt;/a&gt;, which is made for &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;, but can be used outside of Eleventy also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nuxtjs.org/"&gt;Nuxt&lt;/a&gt; (related to Vue) has &lt;a href="https://image.nuxtjs.org/components/nuxt-img/"&gt;nuxt/image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/"&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; (related to React) has  &lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image"&gt;gatsby-plugin-image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; has plugins such as &lt;a href="https://jetpack.com/"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use these plugins, some JavaScript may be required. You could muddle through with Eleventy Image without knowing that much JavaScript. It only makes sense to venture into Nuxt if you already know Vue, and Gatsby if you already know React. It's just to demonstrate that this is something that platform/frameworks are treating as an important concern now, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-background-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What about background images?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background images are specified in CSS with &lt;code&gt;background-image&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, it's probably best to stick with &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries"&gt;media queries&lt;/a&gt; if you want to swap out background images for different screen resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image-set()"&gt;&lt;code&gt;image-set()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which can take multiple resolutions of an image and let the browser make the best decision about which one to use. It is not quite ready for prime-time yet, there are caveats. If you want to explore this further, you can read this article - &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-performant-next-gen-images-in-css-with-image-set/"&gt;Using Performant Next-Gen Images in CSS with image-set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I would think you're in an excellent state if you have done this much. Of course, there are other optimizations you can do. You have to draw a line somewhere. Test your website out and see if more is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-the-new-responsive-era"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What about the new responsive era?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know. I prefer to focus on today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was meant to be a quick article! Anyway, I hope I shed some light on a few bits and bobs with regard to images on the web. Images shouldn't be hard. We shouldn't feel like we are spinning plates when we are building websites! Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm Helen, one of your friendly mods looking after the #sql, #postgres, #mysql, and #database tags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each month, I'll be showcasing some of the great posts, projects, and insights from the data community. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;To get us started we have {SeattleDataGuy](&lt;a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy"&gt;https://dev.to/seattledataguy&lt;/a&gt;) with the steps you can take to go from zero to data engineer with a combination of free courses as well as paid that can help you gain the skills you need to be a data engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/margo_hdb"&gt;Margo&lt;/a&gt; from the HarperDB team then takes a deep dive into database performance and what you should consider when trying to improve the performance of mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create Working YouTube Clone with search box. YouTube API.</title>
      <author>Modern Web</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:29:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kunaal438/create-working-youtube-clone-with-search-box-youtube-api-2a6e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kunaal438/create-working-youtube-clone-with-search-box-youtube-api-2a6e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, welcome. Today we'll see, how we can easily create a youtube clone using HTML, CSS and JS only. No other library. We'll also use youtube API to fetch real data from youtube. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our clone has a lot of features. like, It's look like youtube. All the video data is coming from youtube directly. We have working search bar also which redirects user to official youtube search page. And whenever user click on video card, he/she will be redirect to youtube's official video page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see demo or you want full coding tutorial video. You can watch the tutorial below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#video-tutorial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Video Tutorial
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fOKgHld96mU"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without wasting more time let's see how to code this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kunaal438/youtube-clone/tree/master/img"&gt;Download Project Images&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/kunaal438/youtube-clone"&gt;Download Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, for this project we have 3 files &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt;. Well is uses very basic CSS so i'll not be explaing you each CSS property. But, if you have any doubt feel free to ask me in comments. We'll understand each line of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let's create Navbar. Our Navbar HTML structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navbar"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"toggle-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img/logo.PNG"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"logo"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"search-box"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"search-bar"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"search"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"search-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img/search.PNG"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#dbdbdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.filter-options.active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the last and the main thing. Make video cards. We'll create card from JS dynamically. So for just styling purpose we are creating a single card in HTML. And make sure to create a container for all video cards.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video-container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img/profile-pic.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"thumbnail"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"content"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img/profile-pic.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"channel-icon"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"info"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;youtube clone 2021 | create working youtube clone&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"channel-name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;modern web&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.video-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;250px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;120px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;250px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;grid-gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow-x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;250px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.thumbnail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;150px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;object-fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.channel-icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;object-fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.channel-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;14px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#979797&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lw-hZ8e3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1h712tmfzvdiclo4zbvs.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lw-hZ8e3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1h712tmfzvdiclo4zbvs.PNG" alt="Capture-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now once we made our styling. We don't need our HTML card structure. So, comment it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"video-container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;div class="video"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;img src="img/profile-pic.png" class="thumbnail" alt=""&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;img src="img/profile-pic.png" class="channel-icon" alt=""&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="info"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h4 class="title"&amp;gt;youtube clone 2021 | create working youtube clone&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p class="channel-name"&amp;gt;modern web&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now go and create youtube API key. Watch this to know how create youtube API key.&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fOKgHld96mU?t=1533"&gt;API Key&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you got your API key. Store that in a variable in your &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;your api key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now for fetching Videos. We need youtube api route. You can fine that in youtube documentation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sfGzNtHE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ux6tcn6pybzlqfzu07zm.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sfGzNtHE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ux6tcn6pybzlqfzu07zm.PNG" alt="Capture-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And add this link to the JS file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;your api key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: add "?" at the last of the link because we need to add some parameters to this link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now use fetch method &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; to fetch data from youtube.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;part&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mostPopular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;maxResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;regionCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getChannelIcon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see we are fetching data from the "video_http" that we got from youtube documentaion. And to add parameters to the URL we are using &lt;code&gt;new URLSearchParama(object)&lt;/code&gt;. Pass the parameters that are mentioned in the code. They all are self explanatory. &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt; param define what art of data we want in this case we want all video related data. So, pass &lt;code&gt;snippet&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fetching the data we are converting it to JSON by &lt;code&gt;res.json()&lt;/code&gt;. You can see youtube data structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7hjvYSCL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ocfjfu9570iif9p8ibyg.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7hjvYSCL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ocfjfu9570iif9p8ibyg.PNG" alt="Capture-7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All the data we want is in item's array. So after getting JSON data from &lt;code&gt;res.json()&lt;/code&gt; loop through the &lt;code&gt;data.items&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;forEach()&lt;/code&gt; method and pass that item into a function called &lt;code&gt;getChannelIcon(item)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this function is for. Well, if you see youtube video's data. It contain everything but not channel icon. And we want channel icon too. So we have to fetch icons separately. Using "channel_http"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go and find http for channel data in youtube's documentation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CpBQ4n9M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vd48v74fzl6qth5vduk2.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CpBQ4n9M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vd48v74fzl6qth5vduk2.PNG" alt="Capture-8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And store this HTTP in our &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file. Below our &lt;code&gt;video_http&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;channel_http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And again add "?" at last of the link.&lt;br&gt;
And, Now make that &lt;code&gt;getChannelIcon&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getChannelIcon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channel_http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;part&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channelId&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channelThumbnail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thumbnails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;makeVideoCard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;video_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside this function, we are getting individual video's data because we called this is a loop, remember? And after getting individual video's data we are making request to youtube api for channel information. Again use &lt;code&gt;URLSearchParam&lt;/code&gt; to add parameters. Pass &lt;code&gt;video_data.snippet.channelId&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; param. After getting response convert it into JSON by calling &lt;code&gt;res.json()&lt;/code&gt; and after converting data into JSON. Set &lt;code&gt;video_data.channelThumbnail&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;data.items[0].snippet.thumbnails.default.url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this we have successfully added channel icon URL to our actual video's data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this we are calling another function &lt;code&gt;makeVideoCard(data)&lt;/code&gt;. This function is to create card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, create Video card. But before creating this function select our Video Container element from HTML.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;videoCardContainer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.video-container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;makeVideoCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;videoCardContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;div class="video" onclick="location.href = 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;img src="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thumbnails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;high&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;" class="thumbnail" alt=""&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;img src="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channelThumbnail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;" class="channel-icon" alt=""&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class="info"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h4 class="title"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;p class="channel-name"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;channelTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Explanation
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside this functions, as we have to attach card inside video container element use &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; method to add HTML code inside &lt;code&gt;videoContainer&lt;/code&gt; element. Rememeber to use &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; because we want to add HTML not rewrite the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what we add, well we already have our HTML card structure. Copy that code and paste it here. But use &lt;code&gt;template string&lt;/code&gt; here. So, it will be easy to add variables with text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after pasting HTML structure, remove the actual image sources and titles, channel name instead use &lt;code&gt;${variable}&lt;/code&gt; this to add variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last thing inside &lt;code&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; element use &lt;code&gt;onclick="location.href = 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=${data.id}'"&lt;/code&gt; to add click event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our video card are done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NhaS84Tm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zpcs1jkzi8t58944tu63.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NhaS84Tm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zpcs1jkzi8t58944tu63.PNG" alt="Capture-9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#l"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  L&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E2hO7UBH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5atpxdgyoonw6kvlc53m.PNG" alt="Capture-9"&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-thing-search-box"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last thing - Search Box
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make search box functional first select search box, and search button.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.search-bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchBtn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.search-btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And also create a variable to store search route.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well from where I got this link. You can see in the image below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z-Glz8eo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rpgju75w9nv9s47rc7kr.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z-Glz8eo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rpgju75w9nv9s47rc7kr.PNG" alt="Capture-10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can see this is an actual link which youtube use to search videos. We can use this url, we only need to change the value of &lt;code&gt;search_query&lt;/code&gt; param.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now once we got our link. add click event to button and validate search box. Like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchBtn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And inside that condition use &lt;code&gt;location.href&lt;/code&gt; to redirect user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's it. I hope you understood each and everything. If you have doubt or I missed some thing let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  INTRODUCTION
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously on this challenge, we talked about sass's new import system and also set up everything we needed for our project. If you haven't read my previous blog I suggest you first of all &lt;a href="https://dev.to/rahulshawdev/creating-weather-app-using-javascript-day-1-2b90"&gt;Read It Here&lt;/a&gt; and then proceed. If you don't know about this challenge, well this is just a fun challenge in which I complete one of &lt;a href="https://devchallenges.io/"&gt;DevChallenges.io&lt;/a&gt; challenge and blog my entire journey. This is Day 2 of my challenge and the entire day I completed the design mockups. If you want to follow along then visit my &lt;a href="https://github.com/rahulshawdev/weather-app"&gt;GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#challenge-update"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Challenge Update
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started this challenge I thought I will create it by scratch, will make a pixel-perfect design, and add it to my portfolio website but then I made my mind and thought I will just make this responsive for desktop and mobile. I think I'm not going to add the functionality to search places but rather it will detect your location and give you the weather details. Comment down if you think it is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#design-mockup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Design Mockup
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd day, I completed the design of the app. Before getting weather data from JavaScript using &lt;a href="https://www.metaweather.com/api/"&gt;MetaWeather&lt;/a&gt; API I thought it would be good that I create the designs first and then start getting the API data. So, first of all, I worked on mobile designs as I always do mobile-first-approach then slowly slowly I move forward to the desktop designs. The images of the weather state are provided by the DevChallenges website you can also use the MetaWeather images but I'm following the designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sass-folder-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sass Folder Structure
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, we only had two folders in our &lt;code&gt;scss&lt;/code&gt; folder, an &lt;code&gt;abstracts&lt;/code&gt; folder and a &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; folder. But now I have added two more folders let me walk you through it. First, there is a &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder that contains tiny modules in our webpage for example:- carousels, buttons, cards e.t.c. Then we have a &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; folder which contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site for example:- navigation, footer e.t.c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z7rHYmHM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627557199239/KJkGt_lMw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z7rHYmHM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627557199239/KJkGt_lMw.png" alt="sass folder structure.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to put only those things which help in the layout of the website. Some people add forms in the layout folder and that's not wrong but for me &lt;code&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; folder is for bigger things and the &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder for smaller things for example I would put form styles on the &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder and sidebar styles on the &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; folder. This is completely my way of doing it, follow however you want your files to be arranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; folder, we only have the &lt;code&gt;_main.scss&lt;/code&gt; file which is the main file and contains the styles of everything on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1aICTlUJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627636086570/uxnpvqdDY.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1aICTlUJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627636086570/uxnpvqdDY.png" alt="layouts files.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have the &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder. Inside it, we have some files. First of all, we have a &lt;code&gt;_button.scss&lt;/code&gt; which contains the styling of our buttons. After that, we have a &lt;code&gt;_card.scss&lt;/code&gt; file which contains the styling of the coming week weather data cards. Last but not least we have a &lt;code&gt;_highlight.scss&lt;/code&gt; file which contains the styles of current day weather details like humidity, air pressure, wind pressure e.t.c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wRUoSsU8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627636289945/CZlkAdWYX.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wRUoSsU8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627636289945/CZlkAdWYX.png" alt="components files.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CONCLUSION
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's what I did on the second day, just completed the designs. On the third day, we will be getting user locations and then showing them their weather details, so stay tuned for that. Comment down below if you want to ask something. Also, comment down if you want me to make such blogs or just focus on talking about different technologies.

      <title>How to do it FAST &amp; FREE? : Design to Responsive Web Code</title>
      <author>Jackson Chill</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:26:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jacksonchill2/how-to-do-it-fast-free-design-to-responsive-web-code-fbb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jacksonchill2/how-to-do-it-fast-free-design-to-responsive-web-code-fbb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In usual Responsive Webpage developing way, Developers are required to convert Design file they adapt from Designer, and have to learn the language to convert design's element into Responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, it required some extra costs to learn and complete a simple developing stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a SIMPLE developing stage. Because there is simple substitute solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very recently, a few low-code tools have been successfully developed to improve Developers' workflow. But most of the tools never really get enough exposure and trust, mostly because doesn't sounds persuasive enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also one who never really believe in this at first. But ever since I give it try...... it might sounds cliche, but, it really changed my original workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lOKjbt6M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eewzujsqop2vbwh2dsgm.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lOKjbt6M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eewzujsqop2vbwh2dsgm.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A FAST &amp;amp; FREE tool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been using a Responsive Developing tool called pxCode (&lt;a href="http://www.pxcode.io"&gt;www.pxcode.io&lt;/a&gt;) lately. What surprised me the most is that it allows me to simply skipped the coding &amp;amp; handoff stage, and with just instinctive visual editing steps, I can complete a well-structured Responsive Webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first encounter this tool across YouTube, and this general introduction video caught my attention to give it a try. It introduced some major functions within 4 mins, which I strongly recommend watching.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RF48QP2rbNc"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 Major Editing Steps:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split to Sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart Responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Split to Sections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sUxSyzuH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5gts3pcvyzpgnbv2pfn.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sUxSyzuH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5gts3pcvyzpgnbv2pfn.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, [Split to Sections]. In this stage, you can simply &amp;amp; instinctively split your design into sections, in order to have a better and clearer editing interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In [Analyze Group]. The ultimate target is to turn all the ‘Buggy Group’ into ‘Well-Structured’ mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_FGBbIve--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9gqtvzcwfxs0bn5vmogd.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_FGBbIve--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9gqtvzcwfxs0bn5vmogd.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While [Analyze Group] is the core editing part, it uses four main steps to complete, which are ‘Suggestion’, ‘Clean Up’, ‘Boundary’ &amp;amp; ‘Layout’. Most of the time, pxCode will suggests the possible next editing steps for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have to do here, is to simply decide the options it provided. For Instance, when you’re into ‘Suggestion’ stage, you'll need to judge if the suggestion is suitable, by clicking [Group It] or [Reject].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eA3xvTFj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/icrry77bgwrmuinb8nvm.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eA3xvTFj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/icrry77bgwrmuinb8nvm.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general designs, it was completed by three layers, which are ‘Foreground’, ‘Main Content’, and ‘Background’. Therefore, you'll need to separate them by applying settings for each. It helps maintaining a clean HTML structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, is to apply [Flex Row], [Flex Column], or [Keep as Group] to each content's element, which also affects directly to the HTML structure. Then, pick the main child item in order to enlarge with the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pFexIcPL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vzaqpdityptjw6je45xv.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pFexIcPL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vzaqpdityptjw6je45xv.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Responsive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is the final step of pxCode editing. When you complete all the suggestions and received a ‘Congratulations’ badge, pxCode will suggest to apply ‘Lucky Guess’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will intelligently apply all the suitable numbers for your responsive content, from ‘Margin’, ‘Text’ and ‘Flex’. Therefore, you can make a decent CSS layout while your design can smoothly respond in any resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2uEa0yp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yklaxvz9sy7f5r3hza79.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---2uEa0yp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yklaxvz9sy7f5r3hza79.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give it a TRY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I've been enjoying this tool to convert my usual Design to Web workflow, and still discovering more of the features from it at the moment, as they still have plenty to do on the instructions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I personally looking forward for it to be more profound in the future. At the moment, the tool is unbelievable but completely FREE! not sure will it make any subscriptions fee, but why not try it now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DKZv82rj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/78a68zjms15z7riexw46.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DKZv82rj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/78a68zjms15z7riexw46.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to React for Django backend developers</title>
      <author>Bek Brace</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:05:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bekbrace/introduction-to-react-for-django-backend-developers-5pk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bekbrace/introduction-to-react-for-django-backend-developers-5pk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is how to connect Django backend framework to React front library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to create simple data entry application in the backend and return data on the frontend from the backend using Axios library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the video tutorial on YouTube :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2T9rmFmo48"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason to choose React with Django:&lt;br&gt;
Both React and Django are the most popular libraries and frameworks in their respective domains. React’s SPA optimization and Django’s powerful features make it even better. They have large community support and provide immediate assistance whenever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Django and React parts will be handled separately and this results in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleaner and Clear interface between front-end and back-end logic and functions.&lt;br&gt;
Easy to deploy either the front-end part or the back-end part without redeploying the other.&lt;br&gt;
If there are separate teams working in front-end and back-end respectively they need not worry about another part as both can work independently.&lt;br&gt;
scalable and multiple client (web, mobile) apps. All the clients will have to consume the same API provided by the back-end side.&lt;br&gt;
We need to work on 2 parts :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- The Back-end where we're going to create API using DJANG-REST&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- and the front-end where we will interact directly with the API using React JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we're going to create a simple project to write employee's name and his department in the backend and then connect react as our main frontend to Django server to fetch data and display it in our react application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will work in virtual environemnt, i will use pipenv, so if you dont'have it, you can pip install pipenv and once that finsihed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;go ahead and pipenv install djangorestframework first which is a toolkit for building our API; and also we need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pipenv isntall django-cors-headers&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
for handling the server headers required for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and this is to add CORS headers which allows our API to be accessed on other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and later we will add corsheaders in INSTALLED_APP in settings file in django.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;models.py: Now let’s create a database model for our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is models.py file of our app : ewmployee and department are two fields that are used to store the name of the empl and her or his department respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;serializer.py: Create serializer.py inside the app folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and Serializers are basically used to convert complex data to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON(Which we are going to use in React on the client side).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;views.py: Here is views.py in which we can create our method like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have only two methods, get and post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GET method we are returning data from the model by calling React.objects.all() and then using list comprehension to convert the emp and deptmt in python’s dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the POST method, we are simply saving the data bypassing the data to ReactSerializer().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to define the endpoint of the API which is the URL where our client will hit to consume data from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally the place where our resources (database and other functions) live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;urls.py: Here is the main urls.py from the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The localhost:8000 is the end-point of our ReactView class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few changes in settings.py file which are listed below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- Add rest_framework , core, corsheaders to INSTALLED APPS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- Add corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware to MIDDLEWARE list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- Create a dictionary assigned to REST_FRAMEWORK variable in which insert ‘DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES’: [ ‘rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny’ ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4- Assign variable CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the cors headers package is used to tell the browser that web application running at one origin, access to our backend resources from a different origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's &lt;code&gt;python manage.py makemigrations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then &lt;code&gt;python manage.py migrate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then &lt;code&gt;python manage.py createsuperuser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python manage.py runserver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app frontend&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then cd frontend npm install axios&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axios is the main tool for connecting back-end with front-end. All the requests will be sent to the server (back-end) with the help of Axios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside App.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;import React from 'react';&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
            return(
                    BB Tech Company
                );
             }
          }
export default App;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have to grab data from the server by using Axios. &lt;br&gt;
The componentDidMount method is called when the component is rendered. This is the right time to request a server for the data and we will use Axios in this method to store the data in a state obtained from the server and later on rendered by the help of a map in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run backend server and enter data to be reflected in react&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this was React and Django working hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Airtime can largely be seen as a necessity in today’s world thus when making top-ups, customers are always in search of value. It would be great if an application existed where a user could check for available airtime or data bonuses and promotions in any region around the world. In this article, we’ll build an application that meets this need using React - a JavaScript framework, and &lt;a href="https://reloadly.com"&gt;Reloadly&lt;/a&gt; - a service for global airtime top-ups. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tools-you-will-need"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tools you will need
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; :  A back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; : A package manager for Node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv"&gt;dotenv&lt;/a&gt; :  A module that loads environment variables from an  &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;  file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios"&gt;axios&lt;/a&gt;: A promise based HTTP client for the browser and NodeJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap"&gt;react-bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;: A library that renders Bootstrap components in React applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, intermediate knowledge of JavaScript and React would be fundamental to digesting this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out the source code of this application before reading the article, you can find it &lt;a href="https://github.com/fullstackmafia/reloadly-react-promotion-tracker"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-react-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a React application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to getting started is creating a skeletal React application. The fastest way to do this is to use the  &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;   command via your terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Create a new React application with the below command&lt;/span&gt;

    npx create-react-app reloadly-app

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Navigate to the newly created React application&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;reloadly-app

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Launch the application on your browser&lt;/span&gt;

    npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that  &lt;code&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt;  on the first line is not a typo, it’s a package runner tool that comes with &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;. Your new application’s folder should look somewhat like this when you are done creating it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── RELOADLY-APP
└── public
    ├── index.html
    ├── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    ├── reportWebVitals.js
    ├── setupTests.js
└── .gitignore
└── package-lock.json
└── package.json
└── README.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the app is launched, you should see a web page similar to the image below. At this point, all you’ll see is React’s default web page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C-E9qARt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7a9sat85btm56ucy4ai.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C-E9qARt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7a9sat85btm56ucy4ai.png" alt="create-react-app"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-your-reloadly-access-token"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting your Reloadly access token
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access airtime bonus information from Reloadly, you’ll need an access token. This can be gotten by signing up for an account on Reloadly and using your client credentials to make a POST request for an access token. On your Reloadly dashboard, you can view your client credentials in the Developers section as depicted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NhKJN_Ib--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46db53iba8hmxoujwxem.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NhKJN_Ib--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/46db53iba8hmxoujwxem.png" alt="reloadly-dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note here that your client credentials should be kept private and secure at all times. Use these credentials to make a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request to the &lt;code&gt;https://auth.reloadly.com/oauth/token&lt;/code&gt; URL with the following body parameters:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;client_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;client_secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;grant_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;client_credentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;audience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://topups.reloadly.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can do this via &lt;a href="https://reqbin.com/"&gt;ReqBin&lt;/a&gt;, an online testing tool for REST APIs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgGa7PlsVIY"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#safeguarding-your-access-token"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Safeguarding your access token
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On getting your access token, you’ll need a place to safely store it. This can be done using a  &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file. First navigate to your terminal and in your project, install the &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt;  module:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;dotenv &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
bash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is installed, create a  &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;  file in your project’s root folder and store your access token in it using the format below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .env&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Bearer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fetching-data-with-hooks-and-axios"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fetching data with hooks and Axios
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your access token is safely stored, you can use it to get promotion data from Reloadly’s servers. First, define the variables you will need to use as headers when making a request for the promotion data. The code snippet blow shows how to achieve this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reloadlyJSON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`application/com.reloadly.topups-v1+json`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reloadlyJSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;Authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accessToken&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, you’ll define and handle state management for various data interaction points in your application. The promotion tracker will use three variables to track its different states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;  :  For handling the promotion information retrieved from Reloadly’s servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;countryCode&lt;/code&gt;  :  For handling the country ISO code inputted by a user when requesting for promotion details about a particular country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt;  :  For handling the time intervals between a request to Reloadly’s servers and a response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These states can be managed with React’s  useState()  hook.  The code snippet blow shows how the  useState()  hook initializes and updates state in the  data ,  countryCode  and  loading  variables:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCountryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, you can make a  &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;  request to Reloadly’s  /promotions/country-codes  endpoint with the aid of Axios. The code snippet below shows how this can be achieved by creating an asynchronous function called  &lt;code&gt;Promochecker()&lt;/code&gt;  and in it, making your request:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PromoChecker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://topups.reloadly.com/promotions/country-codes/`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#viewing-an-operators-promotion-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Viewing an operator’s promotion data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps to fetching the promotion data of an operator have been outlined. However, this data needs to be displayed to users of your application. You will also need to display instructions on how to use the application. The achieve these, you will use React’s &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html"&gt;conditional rendering&lt;/a&gt; feature to update the UI of your application. The code snippet below shows how you render a welcome message that will be seen by your application’s users:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;instructions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Welcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;You&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ongoing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promotions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mobile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ups&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s Alpha 2 ISO code.
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;{" "}
    &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
      {" "}
      Refer to this{" "}
      &amp;lt;a
        href="https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      &amp;gt;
        page
      &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;{" "}
      for a complete directory of ISO codes.
    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to display an input form to receive country codes from users. The code snippet below shows how this can be done via an input bar that receives search queries and updates the state of the  &lt;code&gt;countryCode&lt;/code&gt;  variable with them:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input_instructions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Enter country code...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCountryCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After this, you’ll create a button to handle user requests. Your button should be able to perform the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch a request to Reloadly’s servers ( with the  &lt;code&gt;PromoCheck()&lt;/code&gt;  function )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display a spinner during the intervals of making a request and getting a response from Reloadly’s servers ( with the  &lt;code&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt;  variable’s state )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code snippet below depicts how this can be achieved with React’s  &lt;code&gt;onClick()&lt;/code&gt;  event handler and a ternary operator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;input_instructions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PromoChecker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fa fa-refresh fa-spin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;marginRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Spinner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, your home page should have the structure below ( excluding the styling ) when you are done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vtwl96kb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b3lektuvcm82lz4exv36.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vtwl96kb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b3lektuvcm82lz4exv36.png" alt="promotion-tracker-page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To display the information on promotions received as a response, you’ll create an arrow function that maps through the promotion information in the  &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;  variable.  The code snippet below shows how to achieve this using React Bootstrap components:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// src/promotions.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Accordion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;response_card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Accordion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nbsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nbsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8693&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Accordion.Toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Accordion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collapse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;eventKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;denominations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dangerouslySetInnerHTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;__html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;endDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Card.Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Accordion.Collapse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Accordion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;))}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key components of your application are all put up together now. Let’s take a look at how it works when a user makes a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq49qfz2myk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with React Hooks provides a feasible way to handle data across different components. With Reloadly’s REST API, you can retrieve data on telecom operators to meet your specific use case as shown in this article. You can check out the live demo of this application &lt;a href="https://fullstackmafia.github.io/reloadly-react-promotion-tracker/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm Helen, one of your AWS Heroes! At the end of each month, I'll be showcasing some of the great posts, projects, and insights from the AWS community right here on Dev.to. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;To get us started we have &lt;a href="https://dev.to/094459"&gt;Ricardo&lt;/a&gt; from the AWS team with a long read. Learn how to automate multiple architectures and deployment options for your containerised applications, integrating with ECS Anywhere to give you more options for where to deploy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next post by &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mtliendo"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; is all about using Amplify to take care of the heavy-lifting when it comes to setting up AWS services so we can focus on business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How a Programmer Used 300 Lines of Code to Help His Grandma Shop Online with Voice Input</title>
      <author>Vivi-clevercoder</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 08:38:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/viviclevercoder/how-a-programmer-used-300-lines-of-code-to-help-his-grandma-shop-online-with-voice-input-2446</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/viviclevercoder/how-a-programmer-used-300-lines-of-code-to-help-his-grandma-shop-online-with-voice-input-2446</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;"John, why the writing pad is missing again?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John, programmer at Huawei, has a grandma who loves novelty, and lately she's been obsessed with online shopping. Familiarizing herself with major shopping apps and their functions proved to be a piece of cake, and she had thought that her online shopping experience would be effortless — unfortunately, however, she was hindered by product searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John's grandma tended to use handwriting input. When using it, she would often make mistakes, like switching to another input method she found unfamiliar, or tapping on undesired characters or signs.&lt;br&gt;
Except for shopping apps, most mobile apps feature interface designs that are oriented to younger users — it's no wonder that elderly users often struggle to figure out how to use them.&lt;br&gt;
John patiently helped his grandma search for products with handwriting input several times. But then, he decided to use his skills as a veteran coder to give his grandma the best possible online shopping experience. More specifically, instead of helping her adjust to the available input method, he was determined to create an input method that would conform to her usage habits.&lt;br&gt;
Since his grandma tended to err during manual input, John developed an input method that converts speech into text. Grandma was enthusiastic about the new method, because it is remarkably easy to use. All she has to do is to tap on the recording button and say the product's name. The input method then recognizes what she has said, and converts her speech into text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-time speech recognition and speech to text are ideal for a broad range of apps, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game apps (online): Real-time speech recognition comes to users' aid when they team up with others. It frees up users' hands for controlling the action, sparing them from having to type to communicate with their partners. It can also free users from any potential embarrassment related to voice chatting during gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work apps: Speech to text can play a vital role during long conferences, where typing to keep meeting minutes can be tedious and inefficient, with key details being missed. Using speech to text is much more efficient: during a conference, users can use this service to convert audio content into text; after the conference, they can simply retouch the text to make it more logical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning apps: Speech to text can offer users an enhanced learning experience. Without the service, users often have to pause audio materials to take notes, resulting in a fragmented learning process. With speech to text, users can concentrate on listening intently to the material while it is being played, and rely on the service to convert the audio content into text. They can then review the text after finishing the entire course, to ensure that they've mastered the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Implement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two services in HUAWEI ML Kit: automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio file transcription, make it easy to implement the above functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASR can recognize speech of up to 60s, and convert the input speech into text in real time, with recognition accuracy of over 95%. It currently supports Mandarin Chinese (including Chinese-English bilingual speech), English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic.&lt;br&gt;
 Real-time result output&lt;br&gt;
 Available options: with and without speech pickup UI&lt;br&gt;
 Endpoint detection: Start and end points can be accurately located.&lt;br&gt;
 Silence detection: No voice packet is sent for silent portions.&lt;br&gt;
 Intelligent conversion to digital formats: For example, the year 2021 is recognized from voice input.&lt;br&gt;
Audio file transcription can convert an audio file of up to five hours into text with punctuation, and automatically segment the text for greater clarity. In addition, this service can generate text with timestamps, facilitating further function development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this version, both Chinese and English are supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gpthHQZh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9xh5hvh76d5nd2wnjbil.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gpthHQZh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9xh5hvh76d5nd2wnjbil.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Preparations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（1） Configure the Huawei Maven repository address, and put the agconnect-services.json file under the app directory.&lt;br&gt;
Open the build.gradle file in the root directory of your Android Studio project.&lt;br&gt;
Add the AppGallery Connect plugin and the Maven repository.&lt;br&gt;
 Go to allprojects &amp;gt; repositories and configure the Maven repository address for the HMS Core SDK.&lt;br&gt;
 Go to buildscript &amp;gt; repositories and configure the Maven repository address for the HMS Core SDK.&lt;br&gt;
 If the agconnect-services.json file has been added to the app, go to buildscript &amp;gt; dependencies and add the AppGallery Connect plugin configuration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.5.4'
        classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.4.1.300'
        // NOTE: Do not place your app dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files.
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/' }
    }
}
Set the app authentication information. For details, see Notes on Using Cloud Authentication Information.
（2） Add the build dependencies for the HMS Core SDK.
dependencies {
    //The audio file transcription SDK.
    implementation 'com.huawei.hms:ml-computer-voice-aft:2.2.0.300'
    // The ASR SDK.
    implementation 'com.huawei.hms:ml-computer-voice-asr:2.2.0.300'
    // Plugin of ASR.
    implementation 'com.huawei.hms:ml-computer-voice-asr-plugin:2.2.0.300'
    ...
}
apply plugin: 'com.huawei.agconnect'  // AppGallery Connect plugin.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;（3） Configure the signing certificate in the build.gradle file under the app directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file("xxx.jks")
        keyAlias xxx
        keyPassword xxxxxx
        storePassword xxxxxx
        v1SigningEnabled true
        v2SigningEnabled true
    }

}

buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled false
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }

    debug {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        debuggable true
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;（4） Add permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;application
    android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
  ...
&amp;lt;/application&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating the ASR Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（1） Dynamically apply for the permissions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
    requestCameraPermission();
}

private void requestCameraPermission() {
    final String[] permissions = new String[]{Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO};
    if (!ActivityCompat.shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(this, Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO)) {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, permissions, Constants.AUDIO_PERMISSION_CODE);
        return;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;（2） Create an Intent to set parameters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Set authentication information for your app.
MLApplication.getInstance().setApiKey(AGConnectServicesConfig.fromContext(this).getString("client/api_key"));
//// Use Intent for recognition parameter settings.
Intent intentPlugin = new Intent(this, MLAsrCaptureActivity.class)
        // Set the language that can be recognized to English. If this parameter is not set, English is recognized by default. Example: "zh-CN": Chinese; "en-US": English.
        .putExtra(MLAsrCaptureConstants.LANGUAGE, MLAsrConstants.LAN_EN_US)
        // Set whether to display the recognition result on the speech pickup UI.
        .putExtra(MLAsrCaptureConstants.FEATURE, MLAsrCaptureConstants.FEATURE_WORDFLUX);
startActivityForResult(intentPlugin, "1");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;（3） Override the onActivityResult method to process the result returned by ASR.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, @Nullable Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    String text = "";
    if (null == data) {
        addTagItem("Intent data is null.", true);
    }
    if (requestCode == "1") {
        if (data == null) {
            return;
        }
        Bundle bundle = data.getExtras();
        if (bundle == null) {
            return;
        }
        switch (resultCode) {
            case MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_SUCCESS:
                // Obtain the text information recognized from speech.
                if (bundle.containsKey(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_RESULT)) {
                    text = bundle.getString(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_RESULT);
                }
                if (text == null || "".equals(text)) {
                    text = "Result is null.";
                    Log.e(TAG, text);
                } else {
                    // Display the recognition result in the search box.
                    searchEdit.setText(text);
                    goSearch(text, true);
                }
                break;
            // MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_FAILURE: Recognition fails.
            case MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_FAILURE:
                // Check whether an error code is contained.
                if (bundle.containsKey(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_ERROR_CODE)) {
                    text = text + bundle.getInt(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_ERROR_CODE);
                    // Troubleshoot based on the error code.
                }
                // Check whether error information is contained.
                if (bundle.containsKey(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_ERROR_MESSAGE)) {
                    String errorMsg = bundle.getString(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_ERROR_MESSAGE);
                    // Troubleshoot based on the error information.
                    if (errorMsg != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !"".equals(errorMsg)) {
                        text = "[" + text + "]" + errorMsg;
                    }
                }
                // Check whether a sub-error code is contained.
                if (bundle.containsKey(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_SUB_ERROR_CODE)) {
                    int subErrorCode = bundle.getInt(MLAsrCaptureConstants.ASR_SUB_ERROR_CODE);
                    // Troubleshoot based on the sub-error code.
                    text = "[" + text + "]" + subErrorCode;
                }
                Log.e(TAG, text);
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Integrating the Audio File Transcription Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（1） Dynamically apply for the permissions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private static final int REQUEST_EXTERNAL_STORAGE = 1;
private static final String[] PERMISSIONS_STORAGE = {
        Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,
        Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE };
public static void verifyStoragePermissions(Activity activity) {
    // Check if the write permission has been granted.
    int permission = ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(activity,
            Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE);
    if (permission != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        // The permission has not been granted. Prompt the user to grant it.
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(activity, PERMISSIONS_STORAGE,
                REQUEST_EXTERNAL_STORAGE);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（2）   Create and initialize an audio transcription engine, and create an audio file transcription configurator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Set the API key.
MLApplication.getInstance().setApiKey(AGConnectServicesConfig.fromContext(getApplication()).getString("client/api_key"));
MLRemoteAftSetting setting = new MLRemoteAftSetting.Factory()
        // Set the transcription language code, complying with the BCP 47 standard. Currently, Mandarin Chinese and English are supported.
        .setLanguageCode("zh")
        // Set whether to automatically add punctuations to the converted text. The default value is false.
        .enablePunctuation(true)
        // Set whether to generate the text transcription result of each audio segment and the corresponding audio time shift. The default value is false. (This parameter needs to be set only when the audio duration is less than 1 minute.)
        .enableWordTimeOffset(true)
        // Set whether to output the time shift of a sentence in the audio file. The default value is false.
        .enableSentenceTimeOffset(true)
        .create();

// Create an audio transcription engine.
MLRemoteAftEngine engine = MLRemoteAftEngine.getInstance();
engine.init(this);
// Pass the listener callback to the audio transcription engine created beforehand.
engine.setAftListener(aftListener);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（3）   Create a listener callback to process the audio file transcription result.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Transcription of short audio files with a duration of 1 minute or shorter:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private MLRemoteAftListener aftListener = new MLRemoteAftListener() {
    public void onResult(String taskId, MLRemoteAftResult result, Object ext) {
        // Obtain the transcription result notification.
        if (result.isComplete()) {
            // Process the transcription result.
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void onError(String taskId, int errorCode, String message) {
        // Callback upon a transcription error.
    }
    @Override
    public void onInitComplete(String taskId, Object ext) {
        // Reserved.
    }
    @Override
    public void onUploadProgress(String taskId, double progress, Object ext) {
        // Reserved.
    }
    @Override
    public void onEvent(String taskId, int eventId, Object ext) {
        // Reserved.
    }
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Transcription of audio files with a duration longer than 1 minute:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private MLRemoteAftListener asrListener = new MLRemoteAftListener() {
    @Override
    public void onInitComplete(String taskId, Object ext) {
        Log.e(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack onInitComplete");
        // The long audio file is initialized and the transcription starts.
        start(taskId);
    }
    @Override
    public void onUploadProgress(String taskId, double progress, Object ext) {
        Log.e(TAG, " MLAsrCallBack onUploadProgress");
    }
    @Override
    public void onEvent(String taskId, int eventId, Object ext) {
        // Used for the long audio file.
        Log.e(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack onEvent" + eventId);
        if (MLAftEvents.UPLOADED_EVENT == eventId) { // The file is uploaded successfully.
            // Obtain the transcription result.
            startQueryResult(taskId);
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void onResult(String taskId, MLRemoteAftResult result, Object ext) {
        Log.e(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack onResult taskId is :" + taskId + " ");
        if (result != null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack onResult isComplete: " + result.isComplete());
            if (result.isComplete()) {
                TimerTask timerTask = timerTaskMap.get(taskId);
                if (null != timerTask) {
                    timerTask.cancel();
                    timerTaskMap.remove(taskId);
                }
                if (result.getText() != null) {
                    Log.e(TAG, taskId + " MLAsrCallBack onResult result is : " + result.getText());
                    tvText.setText(result.getText());
                }
                List&amp;lt;MLRemoteAftResult.Segment&amp;gt; words = result.getWords();
                if (words != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; words.size() != 0) {
                    for (MLRemoteAftResult.Segment word : words) {
                        Log.e(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack word  text is : " + word.getText() + ", startTime is : " + word.getStartTime() + ". endTime is : " + word.getEndTime());
                    }
                }
                List&amp;lt;MLRemoteAftResult.Segment&amp;gt; sentences = result.getSentences();
                if (sentences != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sentences.size() != 0) {
                    for (MLRemoteAftResult.Segment sentence : sentences) {
                        Log.e(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack sentence  text is : " + sentence.getText() + ", startTime is : " + sentence.getStartTime() + ". endTime is : " + sentence.getEndTime());
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void onError(String taskId, int errorCode, String message) {
        Log.i(TAG, "MLAsrCallBack onError : " + message + "errorCode, " + errorCode);
        switch (errorCode) {
            case MLAftErrors.ERR_AUDIO_FILE_NOTSUPPORTED:
                break;
        }
    }
};
// Upload a transcription task.
private void start(String taskId) {
    Log.e(TAG, "start");
    engine.setAftListener(asrListener);
    engine.startTask(taskId);
}
// Obtain the transcription result.
private Map&amp;lt;String, TimerTask&amp;gt; timerTaskMap = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
private void startQueryResult(final String taskId) {
    Timer mTimer = new Timer();
    TimerTask mTimerTask = new TimerTask() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            getResult(taskId);
        }
    };
    // Periodically obtain the long audio file transcription result every 10s.
    mTimer.schedule(mTimerTask, 5000, 10000);
    // Clear timerTaskMap before destroying the UI.
    timerTaskMap.put(taskId, mTimerTask);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;（4）   Obtain an audio file and upload it to the audio transcription engine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Obtain the URI of an audio file.
Uri uri = getFileUri();
// Obtain the audio duration.
Long audioTime = getAudioFileTimeFromUri(uri);
// Check whether the duration is longer than 60s.
if (audioTime &amp;lt; 60000) {
    // uri indicates audio resources read from the local storage or recorder. Only local audio files with a duration not longer than 1 minute are supported.
    this.taskId = this.engine.shortRecognize(uri, this.setting);
    Log.i(TAG, "Short audio transcription.");
} else {
    // longRecognize is an API used to convert audio files with a duration from 1 minute to 5 hours.
    this.taskId = this.engine.longRecognize(uri, this.setting);
    Log.i(TAG, "Long audio transcription.");
}

private Long getAudioFileTimeFromUri(Uri uri) {
    Long time = null;
    Cursor cursor = this.getContentResolver()
            .query(uri, null, null, null, null);
    if (cursor != null) {

        cursor.moveToFirst();
        time = cursor.getLong(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(MediaStore.Video.Media.DURATION));
    } else {
        MediaPlayer mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer();
        try {
            mediaPlayer.setDataSource(String.valueOf(uri));
            mediaPlayer.prepare();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Failed to read the file time.");
        }
        time = Long.valueOf(mediaPlayer.getDuration());
    }
    return time;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>The Complete Guide to Localizing your App with JavaScript's Internationalization API</title>
      <author>OpenReplay Tech Blog</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/asayerio_techblog/the-complete-guide-to-localizing-your-app-with-javascript-s-internationalization-api-2737</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/asayerio_techblog/the-complete-guide-to-localizing-your-app-with-javascript-s-internationalization-api-2737</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by author &lt;a href="https://blog.openreplay.com/authors/craig-buckler"&gt;Craig Buckler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most native-English web developers, I consider internationalization (i18n) too late. English &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; ubiquitous, yet it's spoken by fewer than one in seven people worldwide. It's the first language of 379 million people but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;917 million speak Mandarin Chinese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;460 million speak Spanish, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;341 million speak Hindi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-English speakers often live in emerging markets enjoying exponential internet growth driven by inexpensive mobile devices and connectivity. The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl"&gt;JavaScript Internationalization API&lt;/a&gt; (i18n) can help localize your site or app and increase its exposure to massive global populations (&lt;a href="https://craigbuckler.com/intl/"&gt;try the localization tool&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#internationalization-seems-simple"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Internationalization seems simple...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...until you try it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools such as &lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/"&gt;Google Translate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://translator.microsoft.com/"&gt;Microsoft Translator&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly viable for language translation. Older systems translated words separately without any context which could mangle sentences. Modern translators use machine learning techniques to analyse key phrases and the results are noticeably better. Unless you have unusual terminology, it may be possible to auto-translate web articles then pay an editor to double-check the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web apps often use far less text than articles so the process &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be easier. In some cases, you can avoid text altogether. If someone is rating your app, most will understand the meaning of emojis such as ❤️, 😊, 👍, or 💩.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your app can also use pictorial icons to convey meaning or functionality. For example, everyone recognises this icon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lo0PrdJ7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/brb7wc5ecmnj8glzct7n.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lo0PrdJ7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/brb7wc5ecmnj8glzct7n.jpg" alt="Not the hamburger icon!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You click it when using a word processor to justify text so it aligns with both the left and right margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be honest: &lt;em&gt;you assumed the icon represented a hamburger menu!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, what would you expect this icon to do?...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JYitadrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2w1aaogegwjtsnou2m2r.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JYitadrM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2w1aaogegwjtsnou2m2r.jpg" alt="Save icon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's commonly used to save data, yet few people under the age of 30 would have ever seen a floppy disk. The PC revolution was predominantly a western phenomenon which bypassed much of the world where mobile phones reign supreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that words will always be necessary to avoid confusion caused by our pictographic complacency! One simple development option is tokenization in your app templates, e.g.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ EMAIL }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{{ EMAIL }}"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;code&gt;"email"&lt;/code&gt; replaces the &lt;code&gt;{{ EMAIL }}&lt;/code&gt; token when it's presented to an English-speaking user. Turkish speakers get &lt;code&gt;"e-posta"&lt;/code&gt;, Samoan speakers get &lt;code&gt;"imeli"&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can have their language determined by a user setting. Alternatively, server-side code can detect the browser's HTTP &lt;code&gt;ACCEPT-LANGUAGE&lt;/code&gt; request header and pull the correct language from a JSON file or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't set a user's language based on their physical position determined from an IP address or &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API"&gt;Geolocation API look-up&lt;/a&gt;. The current country does not always determine the language -- consider Canada, Switzerland, and India. Russia alone has 24 official languages! The user could also be travelling or using a proxy server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/"&gt;gettext&lt;/a&gt; library takes tokenization to another level by allowing you to identify strings in your code. It creates language files that an interpreter can edit and put back into the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language tokenization helps if you consider it from the start although it can be difficult to retrofit an existing app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is the start of your problems. Latin-based languages can be superficially similar. Consider a sign-up form requesting your name, email, credit card, and a date:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Spanish: nombre, email, tarjeta de crédito, fecha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In French: nom, e-mail, carte de crédit, date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In German: name, email, Kreditkarte, datum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks simple, but...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#there-can-be-variations-of-the-same-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There can be variations of the same language
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish spoken in Spain is not identical to that spoken in South America. The Portuguese spoken in Brazil has diverged from that spoken in Portugal. Chinese has at least seven different dialects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further token files can overcome this problem but the scale of the challenge may be greater than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plurals-are-difficult"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plurals are difficult
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pluralise English nouns by adding an 's', for example: 1 cat, 2 cats, 3 cats. Polish, Czech, Latvian, and other Eastern European languages can have up to seven different noun types depending on the quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to avoid pluralisation issues with evasive techniques. For example, rather than displaying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You have ordered 3 tins of cat food"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you opt for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"tins of cat food ordered: 3"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#language-string-lengths"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Language string lengths
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word string lengths can be considerably shorter or longer than English. The word "email" translates to "tölvupóstur" in Icelandic and "электронное письмо" in Russian. You must ensure these strings fit into your English-based UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#alternative-text-orientations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Alternative text orientations
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text is not always oriented from left to right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arabic, Hebrew, Kurdish, and Yiddish use right to left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese use top to bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newer CSS properties such as &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/direction"&gt;&lt;code&gt;direction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode"&gt;&lt;code&gt;writing-mode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-orientation"&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-orientation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-combine-upright"&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-combine-upright&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unicode-bidi"&gt;&lt;code&gt;unicode-bidi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties"&gt;logical block/inline dimensions&lt;/a&gt; will help. Designing a flexible UI that works in all directions is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-formatting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data formatting
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, problems still arise when your app targets English-speaking locales and predominantly shows data rather than text. Consider this string:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your next billing date: 12/03/24&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date slash delimiter isn't commonly-used everywhere but we'll presume most people understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users could read it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"3 December 2024" in US locales that use M-D-Y format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"12 March 2024" in British, European, South American, and Asian locales that use D-M-Y format, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"24 March 2012" in Canadian, Chinese, Japanese, and Hungarian locales that use the considerably more practical Y-M-D format (the most significant digits come first so it's easier to sort).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or consider your next billing cycle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next bill: 1,000 crypto-units&lt;/em&gt; (or whatever currency you're using)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users could read it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"one thousand" in the US, UK, Canada, China, and Japan, but&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those in Spain, France, Germany, and Russia get the bargain price of "1" because a comma denotes the number's decimal fraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you avoid all numeric punctuation and create an exercise app for English speakers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today's target: 10000 meters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translates to 6.2 miles in the USA. Those in the UK, Canada, and Australia would expect 10 thousand measuring instruments - a "meter" rather than a "metre"!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, few people would be confused because the context is clear and non-US English speakers commonly see US terms. That won't always be the case!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easy to gloss over these problems, cause confusion, and increase your user support costs. Fortunately, the JavaScript Intl API can resolve some common data formatting issues...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-javascript-intl-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The JavaScript Intl API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esintl/"&gt;ECMAScript Internationalization API has good support&lt;/a&gt; in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All modern browsers. Even IE11 supports 93% of the standard with Safari on iOS reaching 96%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js 14 and above, but partial support was available from the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deno 1.8 and above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl"&gt;Intl API&lt;/a&gt; has been somewhat unstable and can be a little confusing but it's usable today. If necessary, you can check for browser support with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Intl API is available&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/"&gt;Intl polyfill&lt;/a&gt; is also available but you're unlikely to need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API provides automatic localization of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#date-and-time-localization"&gt;dates and times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#relative-period-localization"&gt;relative periods&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#number-currency-percentage-and-unit-localization"&gt;numbers&lt;/a&gt; including currencies, percentages, and units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#language-region-and-currency-name-localization"&gt;names&lt;/a&gt; of languages, regions, scripts, and currencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#list-localization"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; with conjunctions (and) and disjunctions (or)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#plural-localization"&gt;plural&lt;/a&gt; helpers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#comparison-localization"&gt;string comparisons&lt;/a&gt;, such as equating &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;á&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example returns a string containing the current date and time in your local format:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dateStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;timeStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;"8/31/21, 1:23 PM"&lt;/code&gt; in the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;"31/08/2021, 13:23"&lt;/code&gt; in the UK, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;"2021/08/31 13:23"&lt;/code&gt; in Japan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-a-locale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set a locale
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; objects require a &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locales_argument"&gt;locales argument&lt;/a&gt; which identifies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a language subtag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optionally) a script subtag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optionally) a region or country subtag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optionally) one or more unique variant subtags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optionally) one or more BCP 47 extension sequences, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optionally) a private-use extension sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API will almost certainly support every language you require -- &lt;em&gt;even Klingon!&lt;/em&gt; In most cases, a language (&lt;code&gt;"en"&lt;/code&gt;) or a language and region (&lt;code&gt;"en-US"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"en-GB"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"en-CA"&lt;/code&gt;) is adequate:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A second &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; object can set further parameters, e.g.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;hourCycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;h12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;calendar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;gregory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; objects accept a &lt;code&gt;Locale&lt;/code&gt; object as the first parameter:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Locale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;usa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;timeStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;although you can define a locale as a string alone (as used in most of the examples below):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;timeStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An empty array (&lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;) denotes the user's current locale:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;timeStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Open Source Session Replay
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging a web application in production may be challenging and time-consuming. &lt;a href="https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay"&gt;OpenReplay&lt;/a&gt; is an Open-source alternative to FullStory, LogRocket and Hotjar. It allows you to monitor and replay everything your users do and shows how your app behaves for every issue. &lt;br&gt;
It’s like having your browser’s inspector open while looking over your user’s shoulder.&lt;br&gt;
OpenReplay is the only open-source alternative currently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MvoFt7Qf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openreplay/openreplay/main/static/replayer.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MvoFt7Qf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openreplay/openreplay/main/static/replayer.png" alt="OpenReplay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="#set-a-locale"&gt;locale object&lt;/a&gt;, string, or empty array for the user's current locale, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://craigbuckler.com/intl/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the datetime builder tool...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool generates code for example dates and times with the most useful settings. The full list of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat#parameters"&gt;&lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; properties&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;numbering system: &lt;code&gt;"arab" "beng" "fullwide" "latn"&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;localeMatcher&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;locale matching algorithm: &lt;code&gt;"lookup" "best fit"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;formatMatcher&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;format matching algorithm: &lt;code&gt;"basic" "best fit"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;hour12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;set &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to use 12-hour time notation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;hourCycle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dateStyle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;the date style: &lt;code&gt;"full" "long" "medium" "short"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekday&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;weekday format: &lt;code&gt;"long" "short" "narrow"&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;td&gt;month format: &lt;code&gt;"numeric" "2-digit" "long" "short" "narrow"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;year format: &lt;code&gt;"numeric" "2-digit"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;era&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;era format (AD, BC): &lt;code&gt;"long" "short" "narrow"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;timeStyle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;the time style: &lt;code&gt;"full" "long" "medium" "short"&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dayPeriod&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;period expressions (morning, night, noon): &lt;code&gt;"narrow" "short" "long"&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; objects, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/code&gt; objects&lt;/a&gt; can generate any number of localized strings using a &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat"&gt;&lt;code&gt;format()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; which accepts a standard &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"&gt;JavaScript &lt;code&gt;Date()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// US short dates&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dateStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2022-05-03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "5/3/21"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2022-05-04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "5/4/22"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the new &lt;a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html"&gt;TC39 Temporal object&lt;/a&gt; will provide an alternative to the old and clunky &lt;code&gt;Date()&lt;/code&gt; object in future editions of JavaScript. Whether it's supported by &lt;code&gt;Intl&lt;/code&gt; methods at the same time is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More &lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dateStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;timeStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DisplayNames/of"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.of()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; returns a string according to a &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt; passed. Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// French language in Italian: "francese (Francia)"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DisplayNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Egyptian hieroglyphs in German: "Ägyptische Hieroglyphen"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DisplayNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;de-DE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Egyp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Australia in French: "Australie"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DisplayNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fr-FR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;AU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// British Pounds in Polish: "funt szterling"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DisplayNames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;pl-PL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DisplayNames/resolvedOptions"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.resolvedOptions()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method is also available which returns an object with properties reflecting the computed formatting options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#list-localization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  List localization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat/ListFormat"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl.ListFormat()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object can format an array of items into a localized list which uses a conjunction (an &lt;em&gt;"and"&lt;/em&gt; before the last item in English) or a disjunction (an &lt;em&gt;"or"&lt;/em&gt; before the last item in English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: it cannot localize the text of the items in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initialize the object with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="#set-a-locale"&gt;locale object&lt;/a&gt;, string, or empty array for the user's current locale, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://craigbuckler.com/intl/list.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the list builder tool...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool generates code for example lists using &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat/ListFormat#parameters"&gt;&lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; properties&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;property&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;output format: &lt;code&gt;"conjunction"&lt;/code&gt; (and), &lt;code&gt;"disjunction"&lt;/code&gt; (or), &lt;code&gt;"unit"&lt;/code&gt; (none)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;formatting: &lt;code&gt;"long" "short" "narrow"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat/format"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.format()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browsers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Chrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Firefox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Safari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// US (and): "Chrome, Firefox, and Safari"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;conjunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Italian (or): "Chrome, Firefox, o Safari"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;disjunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browsers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Russian (unit): "Chrome Firefox Safari"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ru-RU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;unit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;browsers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat/formatToParts"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.formatToParts()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method is also available which returns an array of objects containing list name/value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plural-localization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plural localization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules/PluralRules"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl.PluralRules()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object helps determine the pluralization of quantities. Initialize the object with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="#set-a-locale"&gt;locale object&lt;/a&gt;, string, or empty array for the user's current locale, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules/PluralRules#parameters"&gt;options object&lt;/a&gt; which sets a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; property:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cardinal&lt;/code&gt;: a quantity of items (the default), or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ordinal&lt;/code&gt;: a ranking of items, e.g. &lt;code&gt;1st&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2nd&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;3rd&lt;/code&gt; in English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://craigbuckler.com/intl/plural.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the plural builder tool...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool generates code for the input number and uses the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules/select"&gt;&lt;code&gt;select()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; which returns an English string representing the pluralization. This will either be &lt;code&gt;"zero"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"one"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"two"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"few"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"many"&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;"other"&lt;/code&gt;. Examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// US 0 cardinal: "other"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluralRules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cardinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// US 3 ordinal: "few"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluralRules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ordinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a cardinal value returns &lt;code&gt;"other"&lt;/code&gt;, you would typically add an "s" to the end of the noun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an ordinal value returns &lt;code&gt;"two"&lt;/code&gt;, you would add "nd" to the number, i.e. "2nd", "22nd", "122nd", etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules/resolvedOptions"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.resolvedOptions()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method is also available which returns an object with properties reflecting the computed formatting options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparison-localization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparison localization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/Collator"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Intl.Collator()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object enables language-sensitive string comparisons. It's typically used when sorting or searching arrays of stings where you want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;á&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ä&lt;/code&gt; to equate - &lt;em&gt;or not equate&lt;/em&gt; - to the "same" character, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strings containing numbers are sorted so "1" &amp;lt; "2" &amp;lt; "10" (a standard &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sort()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; returns the order ["1", "10", "2"])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initialize the object with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="#set-a-locale"&gt;locale object&lt;/a&gt;, string, or empty array for the user's current locale, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://craigbuckler.com/intl/compare.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the comparison builder tool...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool generates code which compares two values using the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/compare"&gt;&lt;code&gt;compare()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/Collator#parameters"&gt;options object&lt;/a&gt; can set the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;property&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;usage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;whether comparison is for &lt;code&gt;"sort"&lt;/code&gt; (default) or &lt;code&gt;"search"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;sensitivity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;"base" "accent" "case" "variant"&lt;/code&gt; comparisons&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;collation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;variant collation for certain locales&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;numeric&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;set &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for numeric comparisons&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;ignorePunctuation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;set &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to ignore punctuation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;caseFirst&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;either &lt;code&gt;"upper"&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;"lower"&lt;/code&gt; case first&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method will return either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;: the two strings are equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;: the first string is "less" than the second, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;: the first string is "more" than the second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exmaples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// en-US base letter sort: returns 0 (same)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;compare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;á&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// en-US standard sort: returns 1 ("2" &amp;gt; "10")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;compare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// en-US numeric sort: returns -1 ("2" &amp;lt; "10")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Collator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;en-US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;compare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator/resolvedOptions"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.resolvedOptions()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method is also available which returns an object with properties reflecting the computed formatting options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#localizing-an-existing-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Localizing an existing app
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the Intl API server-side if your app is developed in Node.js or Deno. Other languages will have similar libraries although their output strings may differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application presentation logic resides client-side using a framework such as React or Vue.js, it may be possible to format values returned from calculations or Ajax requests before they are output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if your server returns HTML with unformatted or English-based values, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; dynamically update the DOM with localized strings once the page is ready. Consider the following HTML which shows two hard-coded dates in US English format:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Today: &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;datetime=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"2022-05-04"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;05/04/2022&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/time&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Last login: &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;datetime=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"2021-09-05"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;09/05/2022&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/time&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; attributes to reformat date text to the user's current locale:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;DOMContentLoaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Intl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dateStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spanish users would then see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today: 4 de mayo de 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last login: 5 de septiembre de 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/craigbuckler/pen/PomRyvj?editors=1010"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View example code on CodePen...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other text is not translated but the dates become more understandable. You can apply similar DOM updates to numbers and other strings identified in the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible to recurse the whole DOM and translate any dates, times, numbers, percentages, currencies, etc. you encounter. Be wary this could incur significant processing time on larger pages which would become unresponsive after they load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationalization is not easy and the JavaScript Intl API won't solve all your localization issues. However, it will help users read and understand the data displayed on your site or app. You'll be one step closer to global domination!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NestJS/PostgreSQL &amp; Angular within NX Workspace - From scratch to production</title>
      <author>Clément</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:48:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/clement/nestjs-postgresql-angular-within-nx-workspace-from-scratch-to-production-2im8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/clement/nestjs-postgresql-angular-within-nx-workspace-from-scratch-to-production-2im8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post to share my experience on building a client/server solution in NX Workspace with NestJS/Angular. Most tutorials don't explains how to deal with development &amp;amp; production environments and using TypeORM brings some complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to build ?&lt;br&gt;
An Angular web application&lt;br&gt;
A NestJS API, using TypeORM to link a PostgreSQL database&lt;br&gt;
I develop on my local environment, then deploy on production environment via SSH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-local-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup local environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the steps ?&lt;br&gt;
First we will bring up our local (development) environment by creating an NX Workspace.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-nx-workspace@latest
  ? Workspace name&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e.g., orgname&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: banana
  ? What to create &lt;span class="k"&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;the new workspace: angular-nest &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;a workspace with a full stack application &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Angular + Nest&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
  ? Application name: kiwi
  ? Default stylesheet format: SASS&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;.scss&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;http://sass-lang.com]
  ? Use Nx Cloud?: No
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now prepare our local database, I will use PostgreSQL through Docker.&lt;br&gt;
You can install Docker for your OS by reading docker documentation &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/"&gt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file at root of workspace (near package.json)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;3"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;5432:5432"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;POSTGRES_DB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kiwi&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;POSTGRES_USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;_username_&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;POSTGRES_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;_password_&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;adminer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;adminer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;restart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;8080:8080&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Launch our service&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo docker-compose up -d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:8080"&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; and login to view your empty database, empty but up and running !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hGd-WSig--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/59ylakhxthrbm3sr0qkt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hGd-WSig--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/59ylakhxthrbm3sr0qkt.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can setup NestJS to connect our database, we need to install required package&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;ormconfig.local.json&lt;/code&gt; at root of workspace (near package.json)&lt;br&gt;
This file is read by TypeORM to connect to the database&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"postgres"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"host"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"localhost"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"port"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5432&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"username"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"_username_"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"_password_"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"database"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"kiwi"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"entities"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apps/api/**/*.entity.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migrations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apps/api/src/migrations/*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"cli"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migrationsDir"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apps/api/src/migrations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;apps/api/src/app/app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TypeOrmModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nestjs/typeorm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./app.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./app.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// keep this, it force generatePackageJson to add `pg` in dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getConnectionOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;typeorm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TypeOrmModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forRootAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;useFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getConnectionOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;autoLoadEntities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may be asking what is this &lt;code&gt;import { pg } from 'pg';&lt;/code&gt; for ? The answer will come as soon as we will start to build our project for production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create TypeORM migrations we will add some script helpers in the root &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;scripts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migration:create"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npx typeorm migration:create -f ormconfig.local"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migration:run"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts-node --transpile-only ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run -f ormconfig.local"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We these scripts we can create a new migration&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run migration:create &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; CreateUserTable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will create a new file in &lt;code&gt;apps/api/src/migrations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MigrationInterface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;typeorm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CreateUserTable1626968757496&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MigrationInterface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`CREATE TABLE users(firstname varchar(128))`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;queryRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;QueryRunner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we can run the migration&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run migration:run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is to get a database with 2 tables, the well-known &lt;code&gt;migrations&lt;/code&gt; table used TypeORM and our &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BgJmd_Bb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ff9d9bdzqlplp07xqvfl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BgJmd_Bb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ff9d9bdzqlplp07xqvfl.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-production-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup production environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production environment will run a Ubuntu-like distro and connect the server via SSH, let's start to install required packages on the remote server&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install pg nginx
sudo -u postgres psql

postgres=# CREATE USER _prod_username_ WITH PASSWORD '_prod_password_';
CREATE ROLE

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE kiwi;
CREATE DATABASE

postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kiwi to _prod_username_;
GRANT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our database is up and running on the production environment.  Now we will configure Nginx, start to create a folder architecture to host our build code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; workspace/public_html
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; workspace/api
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello world"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; workspace/public_html/index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new Nginx config file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /etc/nginx
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo touch &lt;/span&gt;sites-available/kiwi.example.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put this content in &lt;code&gt;kiwi.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    root /home/john/workspace/public_html;
    index index.html index.htm index.php;
    server_name kiwi.example.com;
    gzip on;

    if ($scheme = http) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3333;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        # try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/kiwi.example.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/kiwi.example.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot

}

server {
    if ($host = kiwi.example.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name kiwi.example.com;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LetsEncrypt configuration is out-of-scope of this article, just be aware that all &lt;code&gt;# managed by Certbot&lt;/code&gt; blocks have been wrote by installing and execute &lt;code&gt;certbot&lt;/code&gt; tool which generate self-signed certificate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then enable this new Nginx configuration&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; sites-available/kiwi.example.com sites-enabled/kiwi.example.com
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;systemctl reload nginx.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can check your public website is up and running by visition &lt;a href="https://kiwi.example.com"&gt;https://kiwi.example.com&lt;/a&gt; and read the greating &lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our API is a NestJS app, we will need NodeJS to run our server. Install it with NVM (&lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script"&gt;https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;node
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add a line at the end of you &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PATH="$PATH:/home/john/.nvm/versions/node/v16.5.0/bin"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have NodeJS we can continue install and setup our API dependencies. Install the tool to run and monitor our API service&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; pm2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's all, our production environment is ready to receive our build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-amp-deploy-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build &amp;amp; Deploy applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave the production environment and go back to the local environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with our API application, we need to build the NestJS code, add migration scripts the build, upload and run the build on the production environnment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;angular.json&lt;/code&gt; to add migration scripts to the build&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"projects"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"api"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"architect"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"build"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"options"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"assets"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apps/api/src/assets"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apps/api/src/migrations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;deploy.sh&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;tools/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;touch tools/deploy.sh
chmod +x tools/deploy.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content of deploy.sh&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;john@kiwi.example.com
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;workspace
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_BASEURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SCRIPT_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;readlink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DIST_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SCRIPT_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/../dist/apps"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;buildApi &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  nx build api &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--generatePackageJson&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;deployApi &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;sshUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_BASEURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/api"&lt;/span&gt;
  scp &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DIST_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/api/&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SCRIPT_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/../ormconfig.json &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sshUrl&lt;/span&gt;
  ssh john@kiwi.example.com &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"
    . ~/.profile &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    cd &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/api &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    npm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    ts-node --transpile-only ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    pm2 reload kiwi-api"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;buildKiwi &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  nx build kiwi
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;deployKiwi &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  scp &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DIST_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/kiwi/&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SSH_BASEURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/public_html"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in
  &lt;/span&gt;api&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    buildApi
    deployApi
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;

  kiwi&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    buildKiwi
    deployKiwi
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;

  all&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    buildApi
    deployApi
    buildKiwi
    deployKiwi
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;esac&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;code&gt;--generatePackageJson&lt;/code&gt; argument on the API build process. This argument asks NX to generate a &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; directory. This &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; will contains all project dependencies that will be required on the production environment. Do you remember the &lt;code&gt;import { pg } from 'pg';&lt;/code&gt; we added in &lt;code&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;, this line is here to force NX to add PostgreSQL has a dependency in this generated &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; because TypeORM does not expose this dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add some script helpers to &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;scripts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"deploy:api"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./tools/deploy.sh api"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"deploy:immo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./tools/deploy.sh immo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"deploy:all"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./tools/deploy.sh all"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migration:create"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npx typeorm migration:create -f ormconfig.local"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migration:run"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts-node --project tsconfig.base.json -O '{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;commonjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;experimentalDecorators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: true}' -r tsconfig-paths/register ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:run -f ormconfig.local"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copy/paste &lt;code&gt;ormconfig.local.json&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ormconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; edit &lt;code&gt;ormconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; to this content&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"type"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"postgres"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"host"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"localhost"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"port"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5432&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"username"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"_prod_username_"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"_prod_password_"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"database"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"kiwi"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"entities"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./**/*.entity.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migrations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./migrations/*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"cli"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"migrationsDir"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apps/api/src/migrations"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are now ready to deploy our apps !&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run deploy:all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command will build the NestJS app, add migrations files to the build, upload the build on the production environment, run the migration on the production environment, reload the API application. Then it will build the Angular app, upload the build on the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
