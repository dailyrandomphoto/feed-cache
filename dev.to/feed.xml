      <guid>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/never-forget-the-importance-of-accessibility-in-digital-products-11</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never forget about accessibility when you are developing digital products. Hopefully this article will reaffirm some of the things I often have to say about the importance of accessibility!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going on and on about accessibility is my thing, I know that, but there are reasons you should listen to what I have to say as they will benefit you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point, in this article I will talk about SEO, conversion rate optimisation and UX and how it ties in with accessibility! Let's begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#give-more-people-access-to-your-message"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Give more people access to your message
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want as many people as possible to hear your message right?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 20% (we don't have an exact figure but it is somewhere between 15% and 20%) of the world's population has some form of disability! People with disabilities visitor your site every day, you just don't realise it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never has it been more critical than today to make sure that you capitalise on every visitor to your site and do your best to turn them into a customer. If you are ignoring the needs of 1 in 6 people then you are not setting yourself up for success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the motions on accessibility, rather than embracing the benefits it brings is only hurting you, your clients and your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it clear how easy it is to stand out in a particular industry you need to know that 97.4% of websites have accessibility errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in for a moment. Only 1 in 50 websites are free from &lt;strong&gt;detectable&lt;/strong&gt; errors. Errors that mean that disabled visitors will be frustrated and ultimately possibly leave in search of a slightly more accessible site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could be the one company in an industry that put the extra time and effort into making your site accessible and really stand out! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down playing the moral and corporate social responsibility side of things for a second, just imagine how being the only accessible site in an industry could benefit you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never ending positive conversations about your company and word of mouth referrals within the disabled community will result in a snowball effect as your site is a pleasure to use and inclusive, rather than impossible to use and exclusionary! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going a step further, imagine how much publicity you can get your site if it is accessible and inclusive! Publications love to talk about the inaccessibility of the web, but they struggle to find examples of accessible sites to show the difference it makes. You could find yourself referenced in some great blog posts with a little effort!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it is worth spending those extra few hours to add WAI-ARIA attributes, use the right HTML elements and check colour contrast in exchange for the huge uplifts your site will see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-the-numbers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run the numbers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around $1 Trillion dollars of spending is controlled by people with disabilities! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when you consider their close family are also likely to favour a company that is inclusive you can soon see why the numbers start to stack up in your favour if you focus on accessibility!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desert your old ways of thinking that accessibility it expensive, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; thinking about accessibility is expensive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of it like this, for every visitor to your site you are currently losing about 10%-20% of your potential customers to poor design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in the history of capitalism has it been more important to look after every single visitor as gaining visitors is more time consuming and costly than it has ever been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going above and beyond for disabled visitors have an added bonus, it also helps everyone else, as good accessibility often results in good UX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this point let's consider colour contrast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make the contrast too low and people who are trying to use your site in bright sunlight on a mobile will struggle to read what you have to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only have to increase the contrast to a decent level (4.5:1) to avoid this problem. I promise you, increasing the contrast will not ruin your design! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cry every time you see grey text on a grey background and weep when you see orange text on a white background, I know I do! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#never-underestimate-the-importance-of-semantic-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Never underestimate the importance of semantic HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to HTML basics is something that a lot of developers need to do! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To call yourself a developer and then produce &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; soup is shocking. We have so many semantically relevant HTML tags that help people use our products and help out site rank on Google, why would you think that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; soup is acceptable! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you want to create an accordion (for example). Do you use a load of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and a load of JavaScript? No, you reach for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and make life easy for yourself and your users! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye bloated and slow JavaScript libraries, hello minimal HTML, semantics, accessibility and performance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never reach for a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; if there is an HTML element that can do the job! Follow this simple rule and your site will be far more accessible and faster too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through your Markup is also far more pleasurable when you have descriptive HTML tags instead of random class names everywhere. It lets you easily see where &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; etc. are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things even better and more consistent you can even target these elements in your CSS, saving you the effort of coming up with class names and making your CSS nice and tidy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me that you don't like clean HTML and easy to follow CSS classes! OK I know some of you use Tailwind and clean HTML is not possible there, but even then having semantic HTML tags let's you see where you are in the document structure far more easily! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-day-1-accessibility-policy-is-the-key-to-success"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A day 1 accessibility policy is the key to success!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lie to yourself all you want with the "I will fix that later" rubbish, we all know it never gets fixed as there are always new features to add and bugs to fix. It will take you far less time doing it now that trying to fix accessibility in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-dont-forget-the-law"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And don't forget the law!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurt and ignore people with disabilities through your negligence and shoddy code and it will eventually come back to bite you!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could end up on the wrong end of a lawsuit that costs you and your company thousands! You have been suitably warned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do now is go back and read the first word of each paragraph and heading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F**k me, I can't believe I got you, I think I won the internet for today, have a great week! 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JTL to CSV using Github Actions</title>
      <author>Boga Sebastian Nicolae</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 16:49:51 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/sebiboga/jtl-to-csv-using-github-actions-5c6n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we just need the data from Aggregate Report to get the data for Benchmarking Testing. We run the JMeter script and then JTL file is generated. &lt;br&gt;
We can use &lt;strong&gt;JMeterPluginsCMD&lt;/strong&gt; to get the data from JTL to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a workflow for Github Actions that run all jmx files from repo, then create JTL file, then create CSV file from this JTL file.  JTL and CSV files are saved as artifacts in Workflow run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      <title>How to Create GUI for remote server with i3 window manager</title>
      <author>nuh yurduseven</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 16:23:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/noaahhh/how-to-create-gui-for-remote-server-with-i3-window-manager-2mj9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/noaahhh/how-to-create-gui-for-remote-server-with-i3-window-manager-2mj9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there. This article is about providing management via a UI by installing a window manager or desktop environment for servers and establishing a remote connection. A graphical server and desktop environment are not used on remote servers because server resources are usually limited. In this post I will be working on a remote server with i3, a lightweight window manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Instead of a remote server, I will prepare a virtual server by giving a random IP on my own computer with Vagrant and perform the operations. This is how you can make your first attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-i3-wm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's i3 wm
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For operating systems based on the Linux kernel, the graphical interface does not directly belong to the operating system. It is a module that connects to the operating system like any application. In this way, a crash on the graphics side does not affect the operating system. It is sufficient to resolve the graphics server error and restart it.” X Window” is a widely used graphics server developed in a very flexible way. Most current and known distributions use Xorg as graphics server. It contains a "window manager" inside. Its task is to organize operations such as screen layout of windows, adjusting the size, creating virtual desktops. Enlightment, Blackbox, kwin in kde and i3 etc… These are examples of window managers. i3 window manager is very light (1.2mb) and easy to use thanks to keyboard shortcuts. This is an alternative to install on your remote servers that are not very resource rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-ubuntu-server-via-vagrantoptional"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Ubuntu server via vagrant(optional)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Vagrant, you can create a virtual server on virtualbox and work on this server. After installing the appropriate vagrant version and oracle virtualbox application for your system, you can create a vagrant box and work as if you were working with a machine with a static IP.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/"&gt;Click the link to download vagrant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;vagrant boxes&lt;/strong&gt;” describe operating systems that are installed and ready to be used. After downloading and creating a vagrant file on &lt;a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search"&gt;“Vagrant cloud”&lt;/a&gt;, it can be raised with vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With vagrant box add &lt;strong&gt;{title}&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;{url}&lt;/strong&gt;, you can download a new vagrant box from the new cloud. You can check with &lt;code&gt;vagrant box list&lt;/code&gt;, create a &lt;code&gt;vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;vagrant init&lt;/code&gt;, and raise the server with &lt;code&gt;vagrant run&lt;/code&gt;. If different configurations are required, you can create vagrant fie manually and then raise it with &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's download the ubuntu box, which is in the first place on the cloud.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After checking if it is in the list, let's save the following vagrant file with the name &lt;code&gt;Vagrantfile&lt;/code&gt; in the directory we are working in. It can then be lifted up with &lt;code&gt;vagrant up&lt;/code&gt;. You can send a "shut down" signal with &lt;code&gt;vagrant halt&lt;/code&gt; to turn it off.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NAME = "remote-Server"  
IP = "192.168.1.XX"

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|  
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.hostname = NAME
  config.vm.network "public_network", ip: IP

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", '2048']
    vb.name='remote-server'
  end
    config.vm.provision "shell" do |s|
    s.inline = "echo Server created succesfully!"
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IP given here is an IP address in the internal network. The virtual machine is a different computer in the internal network and is connected with a bridge adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select your bridge adapter after the up command. Wifi or ethernet adapter. You can see the hostname and username information, and other information...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it's up we can connect via ssh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ssh vagrant@192.168.1.X 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;password: vagrant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and we are inside...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-of-xserver-and-i3-wm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation of xserver and i3 wm
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your server does not have a graphics server on it, it must be installed before i3. You can check it with &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt;. It is a shell script that runs &lt;code&gt;xinit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Xorg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;openbox&lt;/code&gt;should be installed on Ubuntu. It is available in the Repository. You can install them using “&lt;code&gt;apt install&lt;/code&gt;”. You can find x graphics server installations on Centos, opensuse, fedora or bsd based systems in user guides, wiki pages and forums. (stackoverflow, superuser, stackexchange etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, the i3 package in the repository can be downloaded and installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the graphics server should be started using the &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt; shell script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not have limiting factors such as memory and storage space on your remote server, you can use &lt;strong&gt;"xfce desktop environment"&lt;/strong&gt;. This “DE” has a clean interface and uses very little resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connection-of-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connection of Server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different options available at this stage. You can make a remote connection and manage the system with the "remote connection" application you want. You can select an application that you can connect with the operating system you use and the operating system you use on the remote server. Tools such as &lt;strong&gt;teamviewer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;anydesk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tigerVNC&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tightVNC&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;realVNC&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;remmina&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;zoho assist&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Apache Guacamole&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;NoMachine&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;xrdp&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;freeNX&lt;/strong&gt; are widely used. Here we come across &lt;code&gt;SSH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RDP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;VNC&lt;/code&gt; as protocols. &lt;code&gt;SSH (Secure Shell)&lt;/code&gt; is a secure remote connection protocol.&lt;code&gt;RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)&lt;/code&gt; is a protocol developed by Microsoft that enables connection with the graphical interface of remote windows machines. &lt;code&gt;VNC (Virtual Network Connection)&lt;/code&gt; is a platform-independent, server-client architecture protocol that allows to manage applications on a graphical interface running on any network server with a remote connection. You can use any of the above tools for remote control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Apache Guacomole&lt;/code&gt; is a little different. Because it has a client-less structure. After the installation on the server side, the connection can be established and managed via the web browser of any computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use one of the advanced software mentioned above or other than these. But I will use a vnc application to be lightweight. The packages required on the server side are &lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xorg&lt;/code&gt;for Ubuntu server. Apt will automatically install the dependent packages. Firefox and vim can also be installed. These packages should also be installed in distributions such as Centos, SUSE, Arch. Package names may be different in the repository, but basically a graphical server driver and a window manager or desktop environment are needed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;xorg i3 firefox vim 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then tightvncserver should be installed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;tightvncserver 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then the server should be started with the vncserver command. At this stage, vnc password should be determined, if needed, password can be set for view-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives each session an id and to kill the session;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;vncserver &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-kill&lt;/span&gt; :session_number
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Connection can be made by using any client application that supports vnc on the client side. realVNC or remmina etc. applications can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a secure connection, tunneling is done with ssh on the client side. 5900+N port is the default vnc port. Here N stands for the screen number. So more than one X session can be connected. &lt;strong&gt;Default port + session number&lt;/strong&gt; is to make it easier to manage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ssh &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; 5901:127.0.0.1:5091 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; username ip_addr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can monitor whether the connection is established with netstat.(It may differ in some distros. For example, on Solus, the &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt; command does the same job as netstat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it is sufficient to select the &lt;code&gt;VNC protocol&lt;/code&gt; on&lt;code&gt;Remmina&lt;/code&gt; and connect to the &lt;code&gt;localhost:5901&lt;/code&gt; port. Then the connection can be established with vnc password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gsE4NJFD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mn2m7basujw3z1xhl8gv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gsE4NJFD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mn2m7basujw3z1xhl8gv.png" alt="connection via VNC-Remmina" width="482" height="351"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It offers an option to change the config file at first launch or to use it with its default settings.&lt;code&gt;Alt+enter&lt;/code&gt; is used to open terminal with default settings. &lt;code&gt;Alt+h&lt;/code&gt; can be used to split the new window's position vertically, &lt;code&gt;alt+v&lt;/code&gt; to split it horizontally. You can learn the usage information in detail from the user's guide on its web page or from the blogs. Below is a firefox browser, active processes and a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gGoZX9PW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w57yao2gekagopwcdcac.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gGoZX9PW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w57yao2gekagopwcdcac.png" alt="I3 vm and ubuntu" width="560" height="420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vncserver&lt;/code&gt; can be made into a &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; service. In this way, vnc session can be started at every system startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be used in a lightweight "desktop environment" like xfce instead of a "window manager". You can integrate it by making some changes in the configuration settings…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Set up es-lint, prettier, 
husky, lint-staged in vs-code</title>
      <author>Doremon</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 16:07:48 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/adarshmaharjan/set-up-es-lintprettierhuskylint-staged-in-vs-code-1oig</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a beginner developer I ran to different  problem while setting up the es-lint ,prettier,husky and lint-staged. This is the beginners guide to setting up the es-lint with prettier by using husk with lint-staged.I have compiled the knowledge from different docs,blogs,videos and hints while writing this blog and the reference are at the bottom of the page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I have assumed that the user knows the basics of JavaScript,npm(package-manager),git and this will be simple procedural guide to make the configuration approach easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first we install node,git and vs-code in the computer or your computing device. The instruction are present on their official website and the links are given below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initializing-git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initializing git
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing the above things first open vs code then we initialize the git through its terminal or the shell of your device in the given directory that&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also create .gitignore file in the same directory to make sure the file we don't want to track will not to committed in the staging area. For this project we write /node_modules in the .gigignore file as we don't want to track it as it consist most many files to track and occupy lots of space.We write the following text in the .gitignore file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/node_modules
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#downloading-extension"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Downloading Extension
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We download the prettier and es-lint extension from the given vs code extension panel or you can also use web or command in the terminal to download and operate the extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-packages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing packages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we open the project directory that you want to configure in VS-code and first we initialize npm so that the packege.json command will be created.The command is given below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init -y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;npm init -y will simply generate an empty npm project without going through an interactive,so now we install required packages with the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -D eslint prettier husky lint-staged eslint-config-prettier
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The -D  flag will install the packages as the "devDependencies"(i.e Devlopment Dependinces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"devDependencies": Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-eslint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring es-lint
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eslint can be configured with the following command given below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx eslint --init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After execution of the command es-lint will ask some commnd in the terminal and you can configur your project as per your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my project is just a basica vanilla JS I have configured the es-lint in the following way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. How would you like to use ESLint?

To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style

2. How would you like to use ESLint? 

JavaScript modules (import/export)

3. Which framework does your project use?

None of these

4.Does your project use TypeScript? 

No

5. Where does your code run?

Browser

6. How would you like to define a style for your project?

Use a popular style guide

7. Which style guide do you want to follow?

Airbnb: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

8. What format do you want your config file to be in? 

JSON

9. Would you like to install them now with npm? 

Yes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can always configure the eslint as per your needs after the q&amp;amp;a is finished it will install the additional dependencies and create .eslintrc.json file or can be in diffrent file format as per your choice before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-prettier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring Prettier
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We create .prettierrc file in the same directory so that the we can enforce the prettier rules. Some of the enforced prettier rules are given below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "semi": flase,
  "printWidth": 120,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "proseWrap": "preserve"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After this process we add the "prettier" in the .eslintrc.json file so that the conflicting rules between prettier and eslint will be handeled be eslint-config-prettier.After adding the give code the file will be as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true
  },
  "extends": ["airbnb-base", "prettier"],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest",
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuring-husky-and-lintstaged"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuring husky and lint-staged
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to start using lint-staged is to run the following command in your terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx mrm@2 lint-staged
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This command will install and configure husky and lint-staged depending on the code quality tools from your project's package.json dependencies, so please make sure you install (npm install --save-dev) and configure all code quality tools like Prettier and ESLint prior to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to commit changes to package.json and .husky to share this setup with your team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now change a few files, git add or git add --patch some of them to your commit, and try to git commit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this the code of the package.json  will look as given below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "name": "canvas_tutorial",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "script.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1",
        "prepare": "husky install"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "devDependencies": {
        "eslint": "^8.3.0",
        "eslint-config-airbnb-base": "^15.0.0",
        "eslint-config-prettier": "^8.3.0",
        "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.25.3",
        "husky": "^7.0.4",
        "lint-staged": "^12.1.2",
        "prettier": "^2.5.0"
    },
    "lint-staged": {
        "*.js": "eslint --cache --fix",
        "*.{js,css,md}": "prettier --write",
        "*": "git add"
    }
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please test your project to know if the all the process is working well. If your project is linted and well formatted and will only be staged when there is no linting or formatting error then every thing is working well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#further-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Further more
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a stepping stone and you can do a lot with eslint,prettier,husky etc.I would be very glad for to your recommendation for further improvement of the blog &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/codewhiteweb/best-google-fonts-for-your-website-3e5k</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merriweather&lt;br&gt;
Eben Sorkin’s &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?sort=alpha&amp;amp;sidebar.open=true&amp;amp;selection.family=Headland+One&amp;amp;query=merriweather"&gt;Merriweather&lt;/a&gt; is designed for optimal readability on screens. Merriweather’s large x-height boosts the font’s legibility, making it suitable for use in long texts as well as for headlines and titles. Merriweather currently has 8 styles: Light, Regular, Bold, Black, Light Italic, Italic, Bold Italic, Black Italic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hoLu7FfR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzj3579agiit176m9m0y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hoLu7FfR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzj3579agiit176m9m0y.png" alt="Image description" width="804" height="476"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant&lt;br&gt;
This is another very versatile Google font. &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Assistant?sort=alpha"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt; is a clean typeface and offers a generous 6 styles, from extra light to bold. The carefully-planned spacing between the letters create a font with great readability. This, combined with the abundant bold styles makes Assistant especially good for larger bodies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gx_ayfuc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7a85ghil89ie1xlhzd4u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gx_ayfuc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7a85ghil89ie1xlhzd4u.png" alt="Image description" width="750" height="605"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppins&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins/"&gt;Poppins&lt;/a&gt;, created by the Indian Type Foundry, is an attractive, geometric sans-serif font for use in text or display contexts. It’s also the first font on our list to support the Devanagari system, which is used in over 150 languages including Hindi and Sanskrit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mrPuB8uI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1y0k878l206fuv4x1g17.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mrPuB8uI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1y0k878l206fuv4x1g17.png" alt="Image description" width="804" height="649"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caladea&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caladea?sort=alpha"&gt;Caladea&lt;/a&gt; is a modern and friendly Google font. Created from &lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cambo"&gt;Cambo&lt;/a&gt;, Caladea offers 4 different styles to choose from. The font is practical not just in the sense that it has styles to highlight content, but also due to its reliable readability. Caladea works both for big and dramatic titles and small texts that don’t overwhelm readers.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Enriqueta?sort=alpha"&gt;Enriqueta&lt;/a&gt; is a Google font that also brings a certain glamour to any page, but it’s special in its own way. This font has bold features that reminded our team of old-times, adding a Rockwell sort of vibe to the page. The best part? Enriqueta is very well-balanced, and even though it has strong visuals, it still delivers great readability – even in very small bodies!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--do7wvLCG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/af9arp4rtj77mvn12bfl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--do7wvLCG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/af9arp4rtj77mvn12bfl.png" alt="Image description" width="750" height="585"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks for reading... &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Add tailwind (JIT) to a react app without ejecting or using craco</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/kiranojhanp/add-tailwind-jit-to-a-react-app-without-ejecting-or-using-craco-23ln</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7yAbJGM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/plmk4kemu6v2age7x4h2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7yAbJGM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/plmk4kemu6v2age7x4h2.png" alt="React and tailwind without ejecting" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello guys,&lt;br&gt;
Official tailwindcss docs uses a package called &lt;code&gt;craco&lt;/code&gt; during installation of tailwindcss in react app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't particulary like it because same can easily be achieved with just postcss. Here are the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-create-a-react-and-add-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 - Create a react and add dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# install react and navigate inside&lt;/span&gt;
npx create-react-app my-app
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;my-app

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# install packages&lt;/span&gt;
yarn add autoprefixer postcss postcss-cli postcss-import tailwindcss

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# replace yarn add with npm install if using npm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-add-configs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 - Add configs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create two files &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;postcss.config.js&lt;/code&gt; in root
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── src/
├── tailwind.config.js
├── postcss.config.js
└── package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste this in &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;module.exports = {
    mode: "jit",
    purge: ["./public/**/*.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
    theme: {},
};

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste this in &lt;code&gt;postcss.config.js&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require("postcss-import"),
    require("tailwindcss"),
    require("autoprefixer"),
  ],
};

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-create-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 - Create styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a folder &lt;code&gt;styles&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;tailwind.pcss&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;output.css&lt;/code&gt; inside it
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/
├── styles/
         ├── output.css
         └── tailwind.pcss
├── App.js
└── index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add following code inside &lt;code&gt;tailwind.pcss&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@import "tailwindcss/base.css";
@import "tailwindcss/components.css";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities.css";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-modify-raw-packagejson-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 - Modify &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "yarn build:css &amp;amp;&amp;amp; react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "watch:css": "TAILWIND_MODE=watch postcss src/styles/tailwind.pcss -o src/styles/output.css --watch",
    "build:css": "postcss src/styles/tailwind.pcss -o src/styles/output.css --minify"
},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: Just replace &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;npm run&lt;/code&gt; if you are a npm user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-running"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5 - Running
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;App.js&lt;/code&gt; with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function App() {
 return (
   &amp;lt;div class="bg-green-100 border-green-600 border-b p-6 m-4 rounded text-2xl text-center"&amp;gt;
     Hello World
   &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
 );
}

export default App;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-open-two-terminals-and-run-these-commands-separately"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now open two terminals and run these commands separately
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn watch:css
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X-7bXcBo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8501jd4v72q54qaz774j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X-7bXcBo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8501jd4v72q54qaz774j.png" alt="Tailwindcss output image" width="880" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#congrats-you-have-successfully-installed-and-used-tailwindcss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Congrats! You have successfully installed and used tailwindcss 🚀🚀

      <title>8 Easy Ways To Improve The Security Of The Website</title>
      <author>artattackk</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 15:41:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/artattackk/8-easy-ways-to-improve-the-security-of-the-website-176n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/artattackk/8-easy-ways-to-improve-the-security-of-the-website-176n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How your website looks is an important aspect, then safeguarding the website is crucial too. So the &lt;a href="https://www.artattackk.com/"&gt;website designing company in Delhi&lt;/a&gt; recommends improving the security of the website. You can do so by following this blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we will share a few ways to improve the security of the website. Since the website has important data about your employees, company, customers, etc. Keeping them safely is a prime responsibility. Hence, know how you can improve the security of the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating Software:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the software, platforms, or tools you installed to be up-to-date. Hackers target the web software they can easily enter through security flaws. Hence you need to keep these elements updated for improving the security patch. So look forward to the daily updates, if there are any. Update it timely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Secured Web Host:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whom you choose as a web hosting company is important! So we recommend choosing a reputed and secure web hosting company. Many web design companies provide web hosting services like the web designing company in Delhi. Choosing the best web hosting services is very important for maintaining the security of the website since they are aware of these practices and they help you to keep the website secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**&lt;br&gt;
 Hide Admin Page From Index:&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admin page should not appear on the index page. Since it will be difficult to find by the hackers. For hiding the admin page from search engine appearance you can make use of the robots_txt file, which discourages the search engine from listing. This will keep your website safe to some extent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Backup For Data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating data backup is always helpful. In case of website inaccessibility and loss of data. You can access the data through backup. So backup the website data regularly, which will help you to maintain all the data. Many content management programs allow you to use plugins and extensions, which backup the website automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use SSL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a security protocol that creates encryption links between the web server and browser. You can use encrypted SSL for transferring the user’s personal information between the site and database. This will prevent access without proper authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing Security Application:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing security applications is one form to safeguard your website. There are many paid and free applications and tools available, which will make the hacker's life difficult. You can compare and choose the best security tool for your website. Thus, adding it will be beneficial for your website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove Auto-Fill In The Form:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many websites use auto-fill features in their forms, which can be accessed using the user's stolen phone, computer, etc. So we recommend removing it. One must not expose such things on the website, due to the laziness of the legit users. &lt;br&gt;
**&lt;br&gt;
Limit Files Uploads:**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting the file uploads will help you to maintain the security of the websites. Since you directly upload the files will have the chances of bugs entering them. No matter how thoroughly the system checks, there are chances bugs can get through. And through this hackers can access unlimited data on the website. You can upload the files outside the root directory, where you can access them using scripts when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your web hosting company can help you in setting up it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Words:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the few ways you can secure your website from hackers and bugs. We hope this blog from &lt;a href="https://www.artattackk.com/website-design-company-delhi-ncr.html"&gt;best website design company Delhi &lt;/a&gt;has helped you to gain knowledge and be aware of securing your website. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Easily share your Stackoverflow's profile on your README</title>
      <author>johannchopin</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 15:27:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/johannchopin/easily-share-your-stackoverflows-profile-on-your-readme-h9i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/johannchopin/easily-share-your-stackoverflows-profile-on-your-readme-h9i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that it was possible to easily share your Stackoverflow statistics using small dynamic images called "Flair"? This small image simply allows you to embellish your different READMEs like the one on GitHub or your online CV:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0rKmOknP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/8583669.png%3Ftheme%3Ddark" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0rKmOknP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/8583669.png%3Ftheme%3Ddark" alt="SO's Flair" width="208" height="58"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and that just by adding the following Markdown:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight markdown"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;![&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SO's Flair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sx"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/USER_ID.png?theme=dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can check them out at the URL &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/YOUR_USER_ID/YOUR_USER_NAME/flair"&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/users/YOUR_USER_ID/YOUR_USER_NAME/flair&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s3ilAZ8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zuj1zar00dovnl4xmi7v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s3ilAZ8I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zuj1zar00dovnl4xmi7v.png" alt="SO's Flairs page" width="840" height="537"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This service proposed by Stackoverflow works very well, however since it hasn't be updated since a few years, there is some negative point that I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the avatar image is weirdly cropped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only infos are the username, reputation score and badges amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's a png so there is no fancy animation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the image is very pixelated because of its small size (208x58)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and most importantly: you cannot improve it because the project is not open-sourced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I developed my own version of this service that would solve all these problems: &lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile"&gt;stackoverflow-readme-profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
Build the image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can build the image by using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;docker build -t johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This project allows you to embed improved version of those flairs wherever you want: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default Stackoverflow profile:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6UD4emOF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stackoverflow-readme-profile.johannchopin.fr/profile/8583669%3Ftheme%3Ddark" alt="johannchopin's SO profile" width="300" height="86"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller profile:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DkR0FhUe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://stackoverflow-readme-profile.johannchopin.fr/profile-small/8583669%3Ftheme%3Dmonokai" alt="johannchopin's SO profile" width="240" height="57"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just use the following markdown schema to get your flair:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![my SO profile](https://stackoverflow-readme-profile.johannchopin.fr/TEMPLATE_NAME/USER_ID?theme=dark)](https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not yet convinced to use this project? I can understand why using an "unofficial" service doesn't seem like a good idea but here are some points that might change your mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stackoverflow-readme-profile proposes a higher customisation with &lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile/tree/main/docs/profile"&gt;multiple themes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile#templates"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stackoverflow-readme-profile render a svg so the final image is pixel clear and is animated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the project is &lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile"&gt;open-sourced&lt;/a&gt;: You want a new feature or improve something? Just &lt;a href="https://github.com/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile/issues/new"&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; so we can collaborate together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to self host the application? No problem there is already a &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/johannchopin/stackoverflow-readme-profile"&gt;docker image&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for reading. If you are willing to see this project growing don't hesitate to leave a ⭐ to the repo and push your ideas of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the availability of a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;private 5G service&lt;/a&gt; for enterprises named &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;AWS Private 5G&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Here is a fully dedicated video based on AWS Private 5G service👇👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h2ipYqHv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ccr8r4af8k4rxji23zm.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

  ABOUT &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully-featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers — including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies — are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-private-network"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;Private Network&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;Private Mobile Network&lt;/a&gt; features network infrastructure which is used exclusively by devices authorized by the end user organization. Typically, this is deployed in one or more specific locations which are owned or occupied by the end user organization to deliver targeted coverage, capacity and other capabilities. Devices which are registered on public mobile networks will not work on the private network except where specifically authorized.&lt;/p&gt;

  Benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;Private networks&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offering enterprises a greater level of control over deployment, security, equipment and device choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling highly targeted indoor/outdoor coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High and reserved capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing independence from public network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;AWS Private 5G&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a new managed service that helps enterprises set up and scale private 5G mobile networks in their facilities in days instead of months. With just a few clicks in the AWS console, customers specify where they want to build a mobile network and the network capacity needed for their devices. AWS then delivers and maintains the small cell radio units, servers, 5G core, and radio access network (RAN) software, and subscriber identity modules (SIM cards) required to set up a private 5G network and connect devices. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;AWS Private&lt;/a&gt; 5G automates the setup and deployment of the network and scales capacity on-demand to support additional devices and increase network traffic. There are no upfront fees or per-device costs with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;AWS Private 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and customers pay only for the network capacity and throughput they request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many enterprise networks are constrained by increasing growth in users, devices, and application demands. Increased video content, new applications that require ultra-low latency connectivity to end-user devices, and thousands of smart IoT devices demand extended coverage, more capacity, better reliability, and robust security and access control. Customers want to build their own private 5G networks to address these limitations, but private mobile network deployments require customers to invest considerable time, money, and effort to design their network for anticipated peak capacity, and procure and integrate software and hardware components from multiple vendors. Even if customers are able to get the network running, current private mobile network pricing models charge for each connected device and make it cost-prohibitive for use cases that involve thousands of connected devices. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33hA3soOH2Q"&gt;AWS Private&lt;/a&gt; 5G simplifies the procurement and deployment allowing customers to deploy their own 4G/LTE or 5G network within days instead of months, scale up and down the number of connected devices rapidly, and benefit from a familiar on-demand cloud pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;
