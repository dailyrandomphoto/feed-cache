      <title>Crio Winter of Doing: Externships</title>
      <author>Rudrakshi</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 08:56:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rudrakshi99/crio-winter-of-doing-externships-17gi</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rudrakshi99/crio-winter-of-doing-externships-17gi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! In this blog, I am going to share my learning experience of externship during the Crio Winter of Doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crio.do/"&gt;Crio.Do&lt;/a&gt; is a platform that empowers developers to crack real-world industry problems with a moto Learn by Doing.&lt;a href="https://www.crio.do/crio-winter-of-doing/"&gt;Crio Winter of Doing&lt;/a&gt; or CWoD is perfect for working professionals who are looking to gain stellar product development and tech project-building experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-tech-externships"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are tech externships?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech externships are experiential learning opportunities, similar to internships, but shorter and part-time, provided in partnership with tech companies. Crio Winter of Doing externships are a great opportunity to solve real-world problems in an actual tech startup setting and learn key skills that will help you advance your dev career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-of-crio-winter-of-doing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits of Crio Winter of Doing:
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to work on challenging tech projects (externships) directly with top startups in India.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to interact with the biggest names in India’s tech industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You participate in engaging Masterclass workshops on the hottest tech topics from top engineers in India.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eLOo28zB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7qwyllk71s4d96oa51y0.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CWoD program’s structure is divided into 3 stages and at each stage, some students were selected and they moved to the next stage of the program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1:&lt;/strong&gt; It consisted of 8 modules with hands-on experience. They referred to these modules as Bytes which contains important basic concepts of software development like HTTP, REST, Linux Basics, AWS, Git Basics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get introduced to Full-Stack development by building a beautiful portfolio i.e. &lt;a href="https://rudrakshi-profile.netlify.app/"&gt;QProfile&lt;/a&gt; that used some latest technologies like React JS, Gatsby JS and hosted on Netlify and Heroku in which we also used API concepts and HTTP concepts too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2:&lt;/strong&gt; This stage was for the Stage 1 graduate and the time duration for this one was around 3 weeks. In this stage, we get introduced to backend and frontend concepts and the tech stacks required for the externship with the help of shared materials regarding coding and mini-projects. We build a complete mini-project i.e. &lt;a href="https://github.com/rudrakshi99/Xmeme"&gt;XMeme&lt;/a&gt;. On the basis of the scores generated after the project evaluation, some developers are selected for the tech externship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3:&lt;/strong&gt; The time duration for this was around 6 weeks. We get assigned to an externship project recommended by amazing companies like Cred, Groww, Jumbotail, AWS, Slice, and others as well based on our performance and worked in a team of 2 based on our tech stack, under the guidance of industry mentors through AMA sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was assigned a project &lt;a href="https://github.com/rudrakshi99/Cashflow-management-app"&gt;Cash Flow Management App&lt;/a&gt; with Sukanta Nandi, who is a working professional at Cognizant, recommended by &lt;a href="https://jumbotail.com/"&gt;Jumbotail&lt;/a&gt; which is a top-tier VC-funded startup, building an online wholesale marketplace for food and grocery, targeted at wholesale buyers. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kI2AhoZR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7x4nfx9de8tnb2udj5ql.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kI2AhoZR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7x4nfx9de8tnb2udj5ql.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yEJ95kmRPU"&gt;Cash Flow Management App&lt;/a&gt; is an application that enables small business owners to track all their credit and debit transactions in one place. The application has the provision to enter individual transactions for each entity (vendor, customer, etc.). It is capable of pulling up historical transactions related to a particular entity or show the overall cash flow summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was really marvelous and the tasks were challenging for us to complete the project on time. We have submitted regular progress reports and they conducted demos to present our project to the project mentors in order to keep a track of the work. Only 2-3 teams per project were chosen for a final demo to the company. And the best part, all graduating teams are eligible for job referrals through Crio's hiring partners 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, I am very fortunate that I was able to work on a challenging project of an exciting tech startup and acquired new skills in this learning journey. Thank you Crio.do for this amazing opportunity and the externship.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and don’t forget to give your views and suggestions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#the-new-iconic-developers-is-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The new iconic developers is here!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/technoglot"&gt;@technoglot&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/theowlsden"&gt;@theowlsden&lt;/a&gt;
 and &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/nefomemes"&gt;@nefomemes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Keep it up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there will be three more in the comments so we can continue this list 😊😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe some ideas:&lt;br&gt;
😴🤐🤒😵🥴🐱‍👤🙈🙉🙊&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-bug-buster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏹 The Bug Buster
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name says it all: that person on the team that is a master in bug squashing. No pesticides needed: their eyes are enough. No bug is safe from them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#habitat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Habitat
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They live inside IDE's and have static code analysis for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Code quality is their utmost priority!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-to-ask-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best to ask for
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice on how to exterminate bugs. They can sniff them from miles away! 👃🏻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#needs-works-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Needs works on
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on actual features! Squashing bugs is important, but we've got a product to ship! 📦These features won't take care of themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/technoglot/comment/1denf"&gt;Based on this comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-tools-santa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🎅 The tools Santa
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a problem you don't know how to solve? They have a tool for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#habitat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Habitat
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your everyday office, forums, anywhere really. If you have a question, they are there to answer with a tool (a new software, library, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-to-ask-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best to ask for
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An over-engineered solution to a problem. They have experience with a whole lot of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#needs-works-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Needs works on
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tone it down a bit. Not everything needs to be solved with a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/theowlsden/comment/1delm"&gt;Based on this comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-branch-breaker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  😳 The branch breaker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look out! This developer will break your branch. A mistake like running git reset HEAD when they should have used git reset --soft HEAD  is not uncommon..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#habitat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Habitat
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly found behind a terminal looking like 😥. Searching for a fix for the made mistakes, hoping no one will ever find out what they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-to-ask-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best to ask for
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping you fix git mistakes, they’ve been there and know how to get you out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#needs-works-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Needs works on
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admitting their mistakes instead of (trying to) cover them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/nefomemes/comment/1dfbk"&gt;Based on this comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  April, 19th, 2021 - Instalment #64
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsletter #64. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great selection of posts this week, starting off with the announcement last week of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards, the name of the community driven open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. We have a great selection of community posts covering topics such as Apache Zeppelin, Rust, OpenJDK as well as an exciting new project called Lift to watch out for. Some great new open source projects including how to run Haskell on AWS Lambda, a nice project to make it easy to run EKS Distro on your desktop, so make sure you check those out. Finally we have some new events to put in your diary and then the usual round up of AWS open source related posts, a great podcast from Stelligent on the open source project mutato, and a video from the Seattle Java User Group taking a look at "A Journey into Latency Reduction" with Amazon Corretto. Plenty to keep you busy, but first, let's take a look at OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big news of last week was the post announcing OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards, the name of the community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. In the post &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e5"&gt;Introducing OpenSearch&lt;/a&gt;, Carl Meadows, Jules Graybill, Kyle Davis, and Mehul Shah share details of this announcement, how we are working with the community and how the project is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal with the OpenSearch project is to make it easy for as many people and organizations as possible to use OpenSearch in their business, their products, and their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many business are supporting OpenSearch, and are as diverse as Red Hat, SAP, Capital One, and Logz.io. In the post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/eg"&gt;logit.io's response to the Elasticsearch B.V SSPL Licensing Change&lt;/a&gt; from Lee Smith explains how they are looking to incorporate OpenSearch and Open Search Dashboards as part of their Stack offering, just one of many business' that are looking to adopt OpenSearch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essential reading this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source Job of the week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ec"&gt;Sr. Software Development Engineer - rust-vmm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this role, you will work on rust-vmm [1]. Rust-vmm is an open-source project that empowers the community to build custom Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) and hypervisors. It provides a set of virtualisation components that any project can use to quickly develop virtualisation solutions while focusing on the key differentiators of their product rather than re-implementing common components like KVM wrappers, virtio devices and other VMM libraries.The rust-vmm project is organised as a shared effort, shared ownership open-source project that includes (so far) contributors from Alibaba, AWS, Cloud Base, Crowdstrike, Intel, Google, Red Hat as well as individual contributors. It's components are already used in several projects such as Firecracker [2] and Cloud Hypervisor, [3] with more integrations under way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Celebrating open source contributors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles posted in this series are only possible thanks to contributors and project maintainers and so I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to build on top of what they have created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you to the following open source heroes: Shrirang Moghe, Brandon Leach, Chabane Refes, Chanwit Kaewkasi, Adrian Hornsby, Matthieu Napoli, Alolita Sharma, Imaya Kumar Jagannathan, Eitan Sela, Pahud Hsieh, Nima Kaviani, Vikrant Kahlir, Gaurav Dhamija, Sameer Kumar, Gopalakrishnan Subramanian, Shane Miller, Carl Meadows, Jules Graybill, Kyle Davis, Mehul Shah, Colm MacCárthaigh, Curtis Rissi, Mike Salvatore, Lee Smith, Abdullah T, Shane Miller, Wilhelm Wonigkeit, Andy Blackledge, Shubham Muneshwar, Paul Singman, Yishai Galatzer, Kelvin Nilsen, Toshal Dudhwala, Imaya Kumar Jagannathan, Carlos Perea and Luca Mazzaferro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you find and follow these builders and keep up to date with their open source projects and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Serverless Realtime GraphQL applications with AppSync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you sign up to be notified when this new book from a collection of AWS Heroes, Aleksandar Simovic, Slobodan Stojanovic and Gojko Adzic. The book will cover  how to build and operate responsive, collaborative applications at scale with AWS AppSync and GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book will be available in Q3 2021, so &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/er"&gt;click on this link&lt;/a&gt; to keep notified when it has been launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ekz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/et"&gt;ekz&lt;/a&gt; Chanwit Kaewkasi's project is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution built using binaries from the AWS EKS Distro (EKS-D) and aims to be the easiest way to run EKS clusters on desktop (Linux/Mac and Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wai-handler-hal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/eu"&gt;wai-handler-hal&lt;/a&gt; from the Technology team at Bellroy lets you run Haskell (wai) Applications on AWS Lambda. WAI is the Haskell version of WSGI (Python) or Rack (Ruby): the ecosystem's standard library that describes the interface between web servers and web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ssh-restricted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/es"&gt;ssh-restricted&lt;/a&gt; from my colleague Adrian comes this handy AWS Config rule you can use that will check to see if any public ssh with a wide scope (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0) and then trigger a lambda function to remediate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CZ5tuO67--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adhorn/ssh-restricted/master/arch.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CZ5tuO67--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adhorn/ssh-restricted/master/arch.png" alt="arch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;open-distro-for-elasticsearch-grafana-datasource&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/eq"&gt;open-distro-for-elasticsearch-grafana-datasource&lt;/a&gt; with the Open Distro for Elasticsearch plugin, you can run many types of simple or complex Elasticsearch queries to visualise logs or metrics stored in Elasticsearch. You can also annotate your graphs with log events stored in Elasticsearch. The Open Distro for Elasticsearch plugin is similar to the built-in Elasticsearch plugin, but with added support for AWS Sigv4 authentication and Piped Processing Language (PPL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cdk-cloudfront-plus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e1"&gt;cdk-cloudfront-plus&lt;/a&gt; Caught this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pahudnet/status/1381277549154639888"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; from my colleague Pahud Hsieh, which was a great collaboration between a number of AWS Community Builders to build some new AWS CDK constructs covering &lt;a href="mailto:Lambda@Edge"&gt;Lambda@Edge&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great effort, and the constructs cover everything from security, logging and the usual suspects when it comes to working with AWS CloudFront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eks-operators-airflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not ready yet, but a new issue was raised in the Apache Airflow project around creating a new operator to interact with Amazon EKS. You can view the current thinking in the issue, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e9"&gt;Create EKS operators #8544&lt;/a&gt; and the aim of this is to create a new Airflow operator that will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solution is a collection of Operators, and their underlying Hooks, which will be added to the Amazon AWS provider package. These Operators will handle creating and deleting clusters, as well as executing tasks using EKS Managed Node Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;monkey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ee"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt; "The Infection Monkey" is an open source security tool for testing a your resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection. It is not a new open source project, but the new update last week (version 1.10.0) provides a new zero trust assessment capabilities so you can conduct zero trust assessments of your AWS environments to help identify the potential gaps in an organisation’s AWS security posture that can put data at risk. Read more on this by checking out this blog post,&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ef"&gt;The Infection Monkey 1.10.0 — Go Bananas with New AWS Zero Trust Assessments&lt;/a&gt; from Mike Salvatore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aws-htc-grid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/el"&gt;aws-htc-grid&lt;/a&gt; is an open source project that povides a reference architecture that can be used to build and adapt a modern High throughput compute solution using underlying AWS services, allowing users to submit high volumes of short and long running tasks and scaling environments dynamically. The project covers some suggested use cases and also where this may not be the best application. Check out the &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/em"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; which provides clear guidance on how to set this up, the architecture and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--72nfXpAZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-htc-grid/main/docs/images/high_level_architecture.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--72nfXpAZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-htc-grid/main/docs/images/high_level_architecture.png" alt="arch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tui&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e7"&gt;tui&lt;/a&gt; this is a very new open source tool from Teem Ops that provides a nice gui tool that allows you to create generate aws cli commands to launch cloudformation templates that will build what you define. At the moment the support is  limited to EC2 and Autoscaling, but it is very early days for this project. Take a look and why not provide the project some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

What is ArgoCD? &lt;a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/"&gt;ArgoCD&lt;/a&gt; is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new post from Matthieu Napoli, taking a look at Lift, a new open source project that simplifies deploying serverless applications. &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/en"&gt;Static websites on AWS — Designing Lift&lt;/a&gt;. This new project is expected to have its first public beta around May time, and is intended to further simplify the deploying of serverless applications on AWS. The post outlines the options you have today, and how Lift is looking to simplify the deployment of static sites. Make sure you check out the GitHub repo and track it by watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ea"&gt;Java, Scala, Kotlin and TLS1.0 / TLS1.1&lt;/a&gt; Colm MacCárthaigh shares news that you should pay attention to if you are using OpenJDK. From April 20th the open source OpenJDK project will be releasing new versions of JDK11, JDK8, and JDK7 that remove TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 from the default list of supported TLS/SSL protocols. Colm shares for customers using Amazon Corretto that "we’re going to keep TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 in the default set for a while longer, to avoid the breaking change". This post dives deep into the issues as to why these protocols are being removed, so if you have not already planned for this, read this and be ready. As the post adds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenJDK change has been sign-posted in the OpenJDK crypto roadmap for quite a while, but breaking changes like this are still a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s2n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/eb"&gt;Improving security in s2n&lt;/a&gt; I missed this post from Colm MacCárthaigh's blog, shuffle sharding dot com, at the tail end of last year. The post goes into details as to the approach to reviewing security for this open source project, including the use of automation and techniques such as provable security, but crucially also the use of peer review and manual reviews. As a result, the project identified three low level issues which the posts goes on to detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a series of posts from the Rust Foundation aimed at getting to know the board members, last week they published, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e4"&gt;Introducing Shane Miller&lt;/a&gt; where Shane introduces and shares her Rust story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CloudEvents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudEvents is a vendor-neutral specification for defining the format of event data in a common format that is now a CNCF incubating project. In this post from Wilhelm Wonigkeit, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ei"&gt;Direktiv: Transforming AWS EventBridge to CNCF CloudEvents&lt;/a&gt; he shows you how you can use an open source project from vorteil.io called Direktiv, in combination with AWS services such as AWS Lambda to convert the AWS events from EventBridge into compatible CloudEvents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cUuqPPM---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AHCFDijNusuw5_jxGF2vGQQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cUuqPPM---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AHCFDijNusuw5_jxGF2vGQQ.png" alt="arch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a super interesting project, and if you are looking at event driven architectures then you need to check this post out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PartiQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PartiQL is an open sourced query language that provides SQL-compatible query access across multiple data stores containing structured data, semi-structured data, and nested data. It is widely used within Amazon and now available as part of many AWS services. In this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/eh"&gt;Using PartiQL to query AWS DynamoDb in Javascript&lt;/a&gt; Abdullah T shares how this is now enabled in AWS DynamoDB to provide a SQL compatible query language to work with data in Amazon DynamoDB. This means you can write my queries in a more familiar way of SQL-like queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stackoscope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e6"&gt;Introducing Stackoscope&lt;/a&gt; this post from Lumigo announced a new capability from their open source tool (lumigo-cli) that allows you to analyse your serverless applications against a set of best practices, and produce a report which you can then review/action. The tool currently offers a number of recommendations (15) across a number of AWS services, so why not give this a try out on your dev or test environment to see what insights you might get?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MECw5dXx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/lumigo-production/w_477%2Cc_fit/fl_lossy%2Cf_auto/wp-website/2021/03/stackoscope-report.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MECw5dXx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/lumigo-production/w_477%2Cc_fit/fl_lossy%2Cf_auto/wp-website/2021/03/stackoscope-report.png" alt="report"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Toolkit for VS Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ej"&gt;Easier Step Functions with the AWS Toolkit for VS Code&lt;/a&gt; this post from Andy Blackledge takes a look at how this open source plugin for VS Code can really make developing AWS Step Functions much simpler. Andy walks you through an example and provides source code so you can try it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Zeppelin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ek"&gt;Setting Up Dev Endpoint Using Apache Zeppelin With AWS Glue&lt;/a&gt;  Shubham Muneshwar shows you how you can configure Apache Zeppelin to interactively, run, debug and test ETL code before deploying as Glue job or scheduling the ETL process. Apache Zeppelin is an open source project that provides a web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with a large number of languages, such as SQL, Spark, Scala and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Lakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/eo"&gt;3 Data Lake Anti-Patterns to Avoid&lt;/a&gt; Paul Singman shares three anti-patterns with you from a post a few weeks back that I missed. It would be rude of me to tell you what those were without you dipping into this post, so read on and find out more about these anti-patterns. Paul offers some helpful suggestions as to alternatives if you find yourself recognising some of these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e3"&gt;Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL parameters, Part 1: Memory and query plan management&lt;/a&gt; Sameer Kumar and Gopalakrishnan Subramanian ask you to sit down, grab a cup of your favourite beverage in which to enjoy this four part blog post that covers a broad range of topics. In Part 1 they cover parameters that can be useful to tune the memory utilisation of Aurora PostgreSQL, Part 2 it is all about parameters related to replication, security, and logging. From there Part 3 looks at performance of queries and wrapping up with the final part, Part 4 explores how you can align Aurora PostgreSQL closer to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards and reduce the migration effort when migrating from commercial engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e0"&gt;Implement checkpointing with TensorFlow for Amazon SageMaker Managed Spot Training&lt;/a&gt; Eitan Sela shows you how you can train TensorFlow models (in this instance, an image classification model) using SageMaker Managed Spot Training. He shares how using checkpoints locally in the container and loaded checkpoints to resume training can help you save over 70% when training your deep-learning models.&lt;/p&gt;

  Quick updates
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL now support PostgreSQL minor versions 13.2, 12.6, 11.11, 10.16, 9.6.21, and 9.5.25. This release closes security vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL and contains bug fixes and improvements done by the PostgreSQL community. This also includes the final release of PostgreSQL 9.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release adds support for aws_lambda and pg_bigm. aws_lambda allows you to invoke AWS Lambda functions from an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. pg_bigm adds faster full text search to PostgreSQL using a bigram index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters that comprise text are represented as numbers to computers. Languages such as English, French, Russian, and Hebrew use character sets of fewer than 256 characters that can be encoded in a single byte. Languages with many characters (e.g., Japanese) require more numbers, which are represented by multi-byte encoding. pg_bigm allows you to create a 2-gram (bigram) index for faster full text search of text encoded with multi-byte characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports integrating with Microsoft Power BI, a business analytics service that delivers insights to enable fast, informed decisions. Powered by the Open Distro for Elasticsearch ODBC Driver you can now integrate your Microsoft Power BI environment with you Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains using the Open Distro for Elasticsearch SQL Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Distro for Elasticsearch SQL Engine uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manifest search results in a tabular format. One of the key features of this engine is the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver which enables you to integrate various business intelligence (BI) and analytics applications with Elasticsearch. You can now connect Amazon Elasticsearch Service with Microsoft PowerBI to create sophisticated and intelligent data visualisations on top of the search results obtained from Amazon ES by leveraging the Amazon ES- PowerBI Integration, to provide deep data insights.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty eight new or updated datasets from the US Geological Survey, the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, iNaturalist.org, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), and others are available in the Registry of Open Data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the following categories: COVID-19, Agriculture, Astronomy, Climate and Weather, Geospatial, Life Sciences, Machine Learning and Statistical and regulatory. Check out the full list on the announcement page, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/e8"&gt;New datasets available in the Registry of Open Data on AWS from United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, iNaturalist.org, and others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speeding Up Angular Scully Builds in GitHub Actions</title>
      <author>Maina Wycliffe</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:38:45 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-learning/speeding-up-angular-scully-builds-in-github-actions-559g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to learn how you can speed your Scully builds by re-using Angular build artifacts in GitHub Actions. In order to statically build your Angular website with Scully, first you have to do the Angular build and then use the build artifacts to generate a statically generated site using Scully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common for most websites, that content can change without the source code of your website changing. Therefore, it can be wasteful to run an Angular build every time your website content changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, Angular builds time are decent. But due to a number of factors, Angular builds could slow down, like in my case, running purge CSS against &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;Tailwindcss&lt;/a&gt; extends the build time to over 7 minutes. Add everything else together, and my GitHub Actions would take over 12 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-github-releases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using GitHub Releases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we are going to need a place to store our Angular build artifacts. GitHub &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; are a nice way, as it allows you to have a long-term storage of your artifacts that you can use anytime you want. This combined with &lt;code&gt;npm version&lt;/code&gt; means ones you have your features ready; you can cut a release that will be used by subsequent builds as you continue to work on other features and/or improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we are going to build our workflow to have two jobs, the first job will take care of building our Angular app, and creating a release and uploading our build artifacts to the release. While the second job will take care of Scully builds using the latest artifacts stored in GitHub releases and publishing our website to our hosting platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a new tag is added to the repository, we will create a release with the version no. of the tag and upload our angular builds to that release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-our-angular-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building our Angular App
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#listening-to-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Listening to Tags
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will need to trigger our GitHub workflow every time a new tag is created. We will be using tags to create release version. This will allow us to use &lt;code&gt;npm version&lt;/code&gt; to create new build artifacts for us to use during the publishing process.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; In the publish our blog section, we will modify this section to listen to &lt;code&gt;repository_dispatch&lt;/code&gt;, which we will use with webhooks to trigger the workflow when events outside our repository like blog post published occur, you can learn more &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/github-actions-trigger-via-webhooks"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will limit this job to only run when a new tag is created using &lt;code&gt;startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')&lt;/code&gt;. This will allow us to utilize the same workflow file for building and publishing, with them being two separate jobs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  build:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-npm-packages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing NPM Packages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will need to install NPM packages before we can build our angular app. In this case, we are using &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; but feel free to use your favorite package manager. We will start by checking out &lt;code&gt;(git checkout)&lt;/code&gt; our repository. After that, we will then setup NodeJS and finally run yarn install to install our NPM packages.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1
  - name: Setup Node
    uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    with:
      node-version: 12.x
  - name: yarn install
    run: yarn install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-angular-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Angular Project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, we can add a step to run &lt;code&gt;yarn build:prod&lt;/code&gt; to build our Angular app in production.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: yarn build
  run:  yarn build:prod
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-release-and-uploading-artifacts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a Release and Uploading Artifacts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have built our project, we are going to do two things next. We will zip the build artefacts and then create a release and upload our zipped artifact to the releases. We will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/easy-zip-files"&gt;papeloto/action-zip&lt;/a&gt; action to zip the files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- uses: papeloto/action-zip@v1
  with:
    files: "./dist/webapp/"
    dest: webapp.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;webapp&lt;/code&gt; with the output directory of your angular project build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, we are going to create a GitHub release and upload the above zipped artifact to the GitHub release. We will be using &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-release"&gt;ncipollo/release-action action&lt;/a&gt;, to accomplish this as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: Push Build to Releases
  uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
  with:
    artifacts: "webapp.zip"
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is what our workflow looks so far:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: Release a new Version

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  build:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x

      - name: yarn install
        run: yarn install

      - name: yarn build
        run:  yarn build:prod

      - uses: papeloto/action-zip@v1
        with:
          files: "./dist/webapp/"
          dest: webapp.zip

      - name: Push Build to Releases
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          artifacts: "webapp.zip"
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-scully-and-publishing-blog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Scully and Publishing Blog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we are going to add a second job - &lt;code&gt;publishing&lt;/code&gt; - that will download our Angular build artifacts from our repos latest release, run Scully build and upload the artifacts to our hosting platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will need to listen to the on &lt;code&gt;repository_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; as this is how we will trigger our website rebuild when the content on our CMS changes, as explained &lt;a href="https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/github-actions-trigger-via-webhooks"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to use any other GitHub action triggers suitable for your content management system i.e. on push to master on the blog directory if you are using markdown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - publish_blog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we are going to create a publish job, which will run after the build job but if the build job doesn't run, it will run anyway. We will use the &lt;code&gt;if: always()&lt;/code&gt; condition to run the job even if the build doesn't. This will run the publish job if a new blog post is published, which will skip the build job, but also when a new release is made, in which case you want the website to be published with changes that were released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one downside of this approach is that the publish job will run even if the build job fails.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;publish:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [build]
  if: always()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will need to setup Node and run &lt;code&gt;yarn install&lt;/code&gt; to install NPM packages as Scully needs both to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1
  - name: Setup Node
    uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    with:
      node-version: 12.x
  - name: yarn install
    run: yarn install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, we are going to download our build artifact that we uploaded to GitHub release - &lt;code&gt;webapp.zip&lt;/code&gt; - and unzip the content to the &lt;code&gt;dist/webapp&lt;/code&gt; directory. To download the artifact from GitHub release, we will be using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fetch-github-release-asset"&gt;dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset&lt;/a&gt; action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- uses: dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@master
  with:
    repo: "USERNAME/REPOSITORY"
    version: "latest"
    file: "webapp.zip"
    target: "webapp.zip"
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB: For private repository, you will need a GitHub Personal Access Token &lt;code&gt;(PAT)&lt;/code&gt; with at least the &lt;code&gt;org:hook&lt;/code&gt; scope. Learn more &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fetch-github-release-asset#token"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will create a directory to put the angular webapp build artifacts in and then unzip &lt;code&gt;webapp.zip&lt;/code&gt; which we downloaded from GitHub releases.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: create dist directory
  run: mkdir -p dist/webapp

- name: Decompress
  uses: TonyBogdanov/zip@1.0
  with:
      args: unzip -qq ./webapp.zip -d ./dist/webapp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, run &lt;code&gt;yarn scully&lt;/code&gt; for statically site generation of our Angular app:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: Run scully
  run: yarn scully
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we can deploy the Scully build artifact to your website. In this case we will use firebase hosting, which you can do as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: deploy firebase webapp
  uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
  with:
    args: deploy --only hosting
  env:
    FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now our final GitHub Action Workflow looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: Publish Blog

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

  repository_dispatch:
    types:
      - publish_blog
      - build_site

jobs:
  build:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x

      - name: yarn install
        run: yarn install

      - name: yarn build
        run:  yarn build:prod

      - uses: papeloto/action-zip@v1
        with:
          files: "./dist/webapp/"
          dest: webapp.zip

      - name: Push Build to Releases
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          artifacts: "webapp.zip"
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    if: always()

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x

      - name: yarn install
        run: yarn install

      - uses: dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@master
        with:
          repo: "[USERNAME]/[REPO]"
          version: "latest"
          file: "webapp.zip"
          target: "webapp.zip"
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}

      - name: create dist directory
        run: mkdir -p dist/webapp

      - name: Decompress
        uses: TonyBogdanov/zip@1.0
        with:
            args: unzip -qq ./webapp.zip -d ./dist/webapp

      - name: Run scully
        run: yarn scully

      - name: deploy firebase webapp
        uses: w9jds/firebase-action@master
        with:
          args: deploy --only hosting
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have looked at how we can optimize our Scully build time by splitting Angular builds and Scully builds, where we store our Angular builds and re-use the artifacts in future Scully builds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not be necessary for your application if you are not using tools like purge CSS to remove unused CSS, since Angular builds are usually fast for small to medium size applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few things I skipped like caching NPM dependencies, which can shave off a few more seconds from your build time and I highly recommend you implement following instructions &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harun Mbaabu is a &lt;a href="https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/profile/17607"&gt;Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; from the Murang'a University of Technology. He is a Data Scientist and Software Engineer with more than 3 years of experience in full-stack web development. He's been involved in many design thinking panels and conferences like the recently concluded &lt;a href="https://cityjsconf.org/"&gt;CityJS Conference 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's founded two communities: Data Science East Africa and Lux Tech Academy, based in Nairobi, Kenya. He also doubles as a Machine Learning Instructor at Ubunifu College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z-2Yk7I---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fsz1tftxvq4jo70icgdi.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--z-2Yk7I---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fsz1tftxvq4jo70icgdi.jpg" alt="Harun at Ubunifu College"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Julia: How did you get into tech?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; I got into tech back in 2017 when I was still a first-year student in university. I started with web development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Later on, in 2018, my interest in data science spiked after watching a friend do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#julia-whats-dsea-all-about"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Julia: What's DSEA all about?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a community comprised majorly of people from East and West Africa who have an interest and enthusiasm for all things Data Science and Machine Learning. We bring them up, match them with mentors with industrial experience for training. We hold free boot camps for the learners. For instance, we're currently enrolling in the first 2021 boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also help people to get started on projects related to Data Science. We're currently building a project called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeXt_Limited"&gt;Next Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It's more of a start-up that uses AI and modern web development tools to create solutions for Agricultural and Health centers in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we have students from East and West Africa. The ongoing boot camp has learners enrolled from about 10 different countries i.e. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Nigeria. We also have some from Cameroon, Ghana and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm proud of having few people placed for jobs. From the last boot camp we held in 2020, we had more than five people getting job placements as data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also trying to develop solutions for two problems in the largest sector in Kenya: Agriculture. One of them is a PWA app developed with JavaScript and Tensor flow JS. We're trying to make it light (about 100-200kb). It can take photos of maize and cassava and classify the disease and the necessary treatment required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#julia-how-did-you-come-up-with-your-mission-statement-and-tie-it-up-to-dsea-community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Julia: How did you come up with your mission statement and tie it up to DSEA community?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSEA Mission: Bringing together the East African Data Science community to help foster the exchange of innovative ideas and encourage the growth of open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; Our main target was to train the people who can't afford the expenses associated with joining a paid boot camp. We wanted to train them using projects; therefore, we got mentors from all over the world including, the US and UK. One of our most active mentors is a Ph.D. holder in data science from the US. The mentors help them learn and use their skills to innovate real-world solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mission statement speaks for itself - we're bringing together the East Africa data community that'll foster the exchange of innovative ideas and encourage the growth of open-source software in the Data Science field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#julia-how-has-the-microsoft-learn-student-ambassador-program-contributed-to-the-success-of-your-community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Julia: How has the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador program contributed to the success of your community?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; I've been able to get in touch with other mentors and built a network with other MLSAs who've helped me spread the word. I've also had access to personal mentors who've pushed me to to the next level. I've gotten access to learning resources available in Microsoft - like LinkedIn learning courses. I've met a lot of people who've impacted me and the growth of DSEA at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jYzXmecT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9we233r87ut86pozksim.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jYzXmecT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9we233r87ut86pozksim.jpg" alt="Programming session"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#julia-is-dsea-apart-of-lux-tech-academy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Julia: Is DSEA apart of Lux Tech Academy?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, DSEA branched out from Lux Tech Academy. I founded Lux Academy back in 2019 December but, we held our first boot camp in mid-2020. When we first had our boot camp, many people showed interest in python, data science and machine learning. At the time, we were only focusing on basic programming skills in Python and JavaScript. We also did modern web development like building Progressive Web Apps, modern JavaScript and single-page applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to build something as big as MIT but as affordable as a gym subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're a free coding school based in Kenya. We have &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2MekXcO"&gt;campus ambassadors&lt;/a&gt; and hope to enroll about 30 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have Ladies of Lux as an effort to bridge the gender disparity gap in our learners. We aim to have a 50-50 enrollment of both genders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consolata-when-did-you-know-that-it-was-the-right-time-to-start-dsea-and-lux-tech-academy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consolata: When did you know that it was the right time to start DSEA and Lux Tech Academy?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; I followed one of the best pieces of advice that my dad has ever given me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only secret is starting, it doesn't matter if you'll fail or succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any plans that you might have, make sure that you start implementing them as soon as possible. The "right time" is an illusion. It's either now or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bethany-what-do-you-do-outside-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bethany: What do you do outside coding?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; I spend a lot of my free time going out for nature walks or sometimes hikes. I also relax with my friends and family when I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VC15jsZu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t6qwvbq59ps9pt24yspw.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VC15jsZu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t6qwvbq59ps9pt24yspw.jpg" alt="Harun Mbaabu"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bethany-where-do-you-see-dsea-community-in-the-next-two-to-five-years"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bethany: Where do you see DSEA community in the next two to five years?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; Our first target in the next five years is to train more than 20,000 data scientists from Africa. We're also actively recruiting partners who can help out with training and reaching out to more learners who're passionate about data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have learners without stable internet access. We're trying to accommodate them by looking into a cheaper internet connection for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're actively developing projects with the help of our learners. We hope to have built at least implemented three projects in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bethany-whats-your-parting-shot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bethany: What's your parting shot?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harun:&lt;/strong&gt; My greatest joy was joining tech. Your field doesn't matter. If you're in tech and you work smart, you'll always be proud of your achievements. The greatest secret is working smart in tech and trying as much as possible to help others along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stay-in-touch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stay in Touch:
&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>4 Awesome Tools That Help You To Manage You CSS Code Better </title>
      <author>Kiran Raj R</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:22:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/4-awesome-tools-that-help-you-to-manage-you-css-code-better-39b6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/4-awesome-tools-that-help-you-to-manage-you-css-code-better-39b6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned 4 tools that will help you to code CSS better. If our CSS code contain mistakes and we use the code in production as we were unable to find the errors, restructuring the CSS after deploying will be expensive and time consuming. These tools help us to format, organize and sort our CSS Code better, which would help to find error and other pattern issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/"&gt;Sanitize.css&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0_R656bV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dbqvft4kwd9lo836jo3u.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0_R656bV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dbqvft4kwd9lo836jo3u.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sanitize.css is a CSS library that provides consistent, cross-browser default styling of HTML elements alongside useful defaults. It is developed alongside normalize.css, which means every normalization is included, and every normalization and opinion are clearly marked and documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://purgecss.com/configuration.html#configuration-file"&gt;Purgecss.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aolL4479--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/asl33myk8ssas1e14jtc.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aolL4479--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/asl33myk8ssas1e14jtc.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PurgeCSS is a tool to remove unused CSS. It can be part of your development workflow. When you are building a website, you might decide to use a CSS framework like TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, Foundation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cssshrink.com/"&gt;CSS Shrink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8hDnQLYW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ax2385vjqmisx11jnlhz.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8hDnQLYW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ax2385vjqmisx11jnlhz.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This site help you to shrink your CSS code, I mean size of the CSS code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://csslint.net/"&gt;CSS Lint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--35-fb44o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7y7v06nqnx27a1qsjsm6.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--35-fb44o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7y7v06nqnx27a1qsjsm6.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CSS Lint help you to find errors and give you warning about possible broken code pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any better resources let me know, happy coding&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Make your pages look good on social media 🤳</title>
      <author>kaspera</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:16:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kaspera/make-your-pages-look-good-on-social-media-561g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kaspera/make-your-pages-look-good-on-social-media-561g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9BJnP-zh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ptgdyi4yq6elv67vg93a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9BJnP-zh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ptgdyi4yq6elv67vg93a.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve made sure your pages look good and attract customers. But how do your pages look “offsite”? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, how do your pages look when they get shared on social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how our site, Alertdesk.com, looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A3WNvN6x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k825j5hu9alyu1ynnf3p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A3WNvN6x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k825j5hu9alyu1ynnf3p.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Alertdesk.com looks when shared on Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did we achieve that? The answer is social tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social tags refer to Open Graph and the Twitter Cards, which are meta tags you place in the &lt;/p&gt;-section of your pages.

&lt;p&gt;Setting up social tags can make your pages more eye-catching when shared on social media. Properly set up tags can also help sites like Facebook to better understand what your content is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-social-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of social tags
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are essentially two types of social meta tags – those who work on Twitter and those who work on every other site, roughly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two types are called Twitter Card and Open Graph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter Card, developed by Twitter (who would have guessed?), mainly works on Twitter. By adding it to your pages, users who share your pages on Twitter will have a “card” added to their tweet. &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards"&gt;You can read more about Twitter cards here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Graph, developed by Facebook, works on a few more sites than just Facebook. LinkedIn and Pinterest, to name a few, also support the Open Graph-format. &lt;a href="https://ogp.me/"&gt;You can read more about the Open Graph protocol here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-tags-should-you-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which tags should you use?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many kinds of Open Graph- and Twitter Card tags and attributes. We’re not going to cover them all in this article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tags below are the ones you should have to help sites like Facebook and Twitter better understand your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#open-graph-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Open Graph tags
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;og:title – The title of your page (doesn’t have to match your page title).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;og:url – The canonical URL of your page (all shares will go to this URL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;og:image – The URL of the image you want to appear in your social snippet (recommended resolution 1200×627 px).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;og:description – A description of your page (doesn’t have to match your page’s meta description).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be a good idea to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;og:type – The type of content (Article, website, video, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;og:locale – Your page’s language (Facebook will assume this is “en_US” if no other is set).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#twitter-card-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Twitter Card tags
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter:card – The type of card you want – &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards"&gt;choose between 4 types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter:title – The title of your page (doesn’t have to match your page title).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter:description – A description of your page (doesn’t have to match your page’s meta description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter:image – The URL of the image you want to appear in your social snippet (1:1 aspect ratio – minimum 144×144 px and maximum 4096×4096 px).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: For Pinterest, there are a few more Open Graph tags available. &lt;a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/rich-pins/reference/"&gt;You can view Pinterest’s documentation here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-set-up-your-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to set up your tags
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using WordPress, several plugins can get the job done. SEO plugins like &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/"&gt;Yoast SEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/"&gt;RankMath&lt;/a&gt; both have a social feature, where you can customize your Open Graph and Twitter Card data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all CMS’ either have this functionality natively, like &lt;a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009564587"&gt;Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;, or has some kind of plugin or add-on for it like &lt;a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/mageworx-module-seomarkupmeta.html"&gt;Magento&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-view-and-debug-your-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to view and debug your tags
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may need to test and debug your tags. For that, you can use these tools to get the job done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/"&gt;Facebook Sharing Debugger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator"&gt;Twitter Card Validator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/inspect/"&gt;LinkedIn Post Inspector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How to Grow a Freelancing Business by Outsourcing</title>
      <author>Kyle Prinsloo 🚀</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 06:57:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/study_web_dev/how-to-grow-a-freelancing-business-by-outsourcing-4hp3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/study_web_dev/how-to-grow-a-freelancing-business-by-outsourcing-4hp3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing can change your &lt;a href="https://studywebdevelopment.com/how-to-start-freelancing-as-developer.html"&gt;freelancing business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you realize that TIME is your greatest ASSET, you'll think of your work and life differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people are able to work 4 hour days, earn a good income and live a life of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to get to this outcome, with outsourcing being near the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is outsourcing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are paying someone else to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the "how" of outsourcing, let's have a closer look at some of the tangible benefits you can derive from including it in your business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-of-outsourcing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits of Outsourcing
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-increase-efficiencypromote-growth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Increase Efficiency/Promote Growth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As freelancers, we like to think we can do and handle everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see yourself as the sole solution to completing a project then you will achieve one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will maximize profits in the short term by doing all the work yourself, but you may land in a position where you are pressed for time with creeping deadlines catching you out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will only be able to accept a small number of projects at a time due to the physical limitations of how much work you can do in any given day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can make this work, but the solution that will see you avoiding both options is getting others involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By breaking a web development project into different aspects and delegating it to others capable of completing those tasks, you will naturally be able to take on more projects without, in theory, a drop in quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By carefully selecting the right people to trust in working on specific project objectives, you may find an increase in quality compared to if you did the work yourself. You can intentionally only outsource work to others that they are particularly skilled with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you're not a great logo designer, then you can find someone who is especially skilled with logos to create one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach to delegating specific tasks to those with the specific relevant skill will allow you to scale your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-increase-focus-on-core-activities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Increase Focus on Core Activities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagin you have a project that includes a wireframe design, logo design, copywriting, SEO and the actual development of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to the outsourcing of a logo design, you've saved yourself hours of work. Sure, it's always good to learn and improve your design skills as a developer and practising with a logo design is a good opportunity for this but it detracts from two things - quality, as we have already spoken about, and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having a logo design off your plate, you can now focus on project tasks that you are more skilled with like the site development. Or maybe you've outsourced that too which leaves you more time to focus on creating the perfect website design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time to focus on what you're good at will result in an overall better end-result, a happier client, more referrals, and business growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-staffing-flexibilitycost-saving"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Staffing Flexibility/Cost Saving
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a certain benefit if you are considering hiring full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you're already quite established in your industry, you're going to find business to be up and down - some months will be good or great while others will be bad or terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the nature of freelancing and is a risk you need to be ready to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to avoid this, &lt;a href="https://studywebdevelopment.com/digital-marketing.html"&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you add others to your full-time staff, you're adding the potential for collateral damage should things go wrong. At the very least, you'll essentially be wasting money if you are paying a full-time employee to fulfil project-related tasks when there are no projects to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing alleviates these risks by virtue of their temporary nature. You only need help with projects when there is work so your work relationship can end, or be on hold, until the next project comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is more frugal and can be a wise decision to make, especially in the early stages of your business' growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-outsource"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Outsource
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-define-your-goals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Define your goals
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to use your freelancing as a way of growing in the many subfields within freelance development?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to treat your freelancing business as a business from the start with the only goal being growth and industry establishment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you want both and are open to learning new skills while keeping your eye on the horizon in terms of what's possible for your business to grow into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some freelancers only use this opportunity to learn new skills while getting paid until they feel they are ready to take on full-time employment with a company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing may be less beneficial to them in this short-term approach, but it depends on what they outsource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about your goals here before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-weigh-things-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Weigh Things Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to be a freelancer who only works on project code or do you mainly want to design websites while dabbling with some copywriting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't have to decide and stick to your decision for the rest of your career, but it's worth a moment of introspection to figure what you would like to do yourself and what you like to pay others to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned earlier, you may feel like you can or want to take care of every aspect of the project. That's fine, it'll work in the beginning but will cap your progress and scalability later. There is only so much time and resources available so choosing correctly can save you both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've done this, choosing the right person to help becomes a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-budget"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Budget
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know exactly how much you can afford to spend on a freelance logo designer before it becomes financially unfeasible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to become serious about your business finances if outsourcing is going to be a viable solution for your business to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, "serious" does not mean "underpaying people", it means understanding exactly what your expenses are capped at and what you have to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this right, you need to figure out the quality of work you can get for a certain price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, you need to undertake a bit of research, observe what’s the going price on different freelancing platforms to get ideas and then cap yourself. It will be tempting to go over this limit when you have found someone amazing but this limit is meant to guide you and serve as a reminder of what is possible versus what is financially speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the cost-benefit of outsourcing project tasks, it's time to find your person or people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-start-looking-for-people"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Start Looking for People
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you will know exactly what tasks you'd like to outsource and why it makes sense to outsource them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also know exactly how much money is reasonable to spend. This is a really important fact to possess because prices vary wildly out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend starting your search with your inner social circle and expanding out from there. This will come with a higher inherent trust between you and the other party than what you would get with a random person from the internet at the outset of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From your inner circle of friends and family, you can move to social media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a popular place for developers to get in touch with freelancers who can help them with specific tasks. You can send out a tweet and you'll have people reaching out to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did that and found some great writers and designers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have found someone through social media, it's worth checking out freelancer platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. This has the potential to be more reliable than your inner circle and social media-sourced people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These platforms are equipped with smart filters allowing you to only view the profiles of those who fit within your predefined parameters such as price per hour, area of expertise, and years of expertise. You're able to see some examples of their work and get a feel for what it would be like to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a combination of the above methods to get a couple of people that seem suitable. Don't overthink it but it's good to have a couple of options which you can weigh up in terms of quality, price, and communication-style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-go-for-a-trial-period-if-possible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Go for a trial period (if possible)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some won't allow this and will instead only allow you to immediately hire them for a particular task but, where possible, you should first agree on a trial period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously not needed if you require them to perform one specific task that will be completed in a week. It's more useful for repetitive tasks that you'll need someone for such as monthly content writing for the marketing strategy you provide your clients or weekly site maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases like these, it's better to first get a feel for what it's like to work with the other person before committing to a longer-term working relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents as a chance for you to see how they communicate, whether they stick to deadlines, what quality of work they produce, and it gives you an overall feel for how pleasant it is to work with this person overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, hiring someone to help out is supposed to make your life easier, not harder so take your time in choosing the person for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use (and continue to use) UpWork and Hubstaff Talent - great resources to find quality people to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-reap-the-rewards"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Reap the Rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you've got someone working on parts of your projects, you'll find that you have more time to focus on areas that deserve your specific attention. This will result in a higher quality end-result making your clients very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, you can outsource more of the work as your business grows and you learn to step away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is a skill that deserves your attention as a freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's one that you should pick up, put into practice and expand upon. Your freelancing business will grow without it taking over your entire life and every single minute of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to remember why we started freelancing after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of us, it was to begin a life of more freedom... Outsourcing can help us get there faster without sacrificing any of the attention to detail we bestow on our projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found this helpful?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating an SSH connection to a server</title>
      <author>Chris Bongers</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 06:49:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/creating-an-ssh-connection-to-a-server-4c8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/creating-an-ssh-connection-to-a-server-4c8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSH is an amazing way to make secure connections to servers.&lt;br&gt;
It stands for Secure Shell, and it's a network protocol between two computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case my laptop, and the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often servers will come with a terminal you will be able to access from their platform. However, this becomes a shell inside a shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's slow, you can't use copy-paste and it hangs suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you are in need of a connection to configure some auto deployments from GitHub!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good reasons to have an SSH connection to your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today's article, I'll show you how to set up an SSH connection to a server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your basic command will look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh user@server.domain.com
// or
ssh user@123.132.12.22
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we could use it with a password we set on the server, however in this case we don't want that.&lt;br&gt;
We want an instant connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generating-the-ssh-key"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generating the SSH key
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can do anything we need an SSH key.&lt;br&gt;
It might be that your computer already has one in place for GitHub or whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to make separate ones that I can remove one-by-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's open up the terminal and run the following command to create a new key.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; ed25519 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"you@email.com"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Change the email to whatever note you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will prompt the following options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File (Generally something like: &lt;code&gt;/Users/chrisbongers/.ssh/id_ed25519&lt;/code&gt; however you might want to make the name more unique to identify the use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I'll be using &lt;code&gt;server_1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it will ask for a passphrase, and we just type enter, do not use a passphrase here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the reporting passphrase also leave it empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IeiaNKTx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618554724478/vFek0-rZu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IeiaNKTx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618554724478/vFek0-rZu.png" alt="SSH KeyGen output"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, we should now have the public and private keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-the-authorized-keys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting the Authorized keys
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to set this key as an enabled host on the server.&lt;br&gt;
At this point you can use the server terminal interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your server should have a &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/&lt;/code&gt; directory, if not you can make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside we should have or add the file: &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inside on a new rule place your key which you can get with the following command on your local computer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pbcopy &amp;lt; ~/.ssh/server_1.pub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where server_1 is the name you gave your key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will copy a string like this to your keyboard.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIH4TBYa16+8t9LJmqCuMjq+4PSxca81L8sN8OSgT5YW9 you@email.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Save the file and we should now be able to connect with this key!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-to-the-server-with-the-ssh-key"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting to the server with the SSH key
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now since we named our key differently we should either do a manual statement of the key or add it in our SSH config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add our new key with the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-K&lt;/span&gt; ~/.ssh/server_1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now we should be able to test out our SSH key.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh user@127.127.10.12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Change the user and IP according to your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And running the above command should bring us into the server!&lt;br&gt;
The first time we'll be prompted with an authentication prompt.&lt;br&gt;
We have to say yes to allow the connection once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing that, we can just connect without problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thank-you-for-reading-and-lets-connect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thank you for reading, and let's connect!
