      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is my experience from 2020. It was sitting in my drafts for many months and thanks to procrastination I never able to finish it. But finally today it can go out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days back (in 2020), I tweeted about my new career move. I was happy to see the love and support of the community. I got a few common questions about my job change and interview process. There are many wonderful resources (blogs, videos, etc) available for interview tips &amp;amp; preparation. So, this is not going to focus on that at all and especially "HOW TO GET PLACED INTO FAANG". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions I think are most of the time missing from those guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-why-i-have-decided-to-change"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Why I have decided to change?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at this question another way - "Where I want my career to be not after 5 years but after every year."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Is there any new skill I want to learn and work on?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Can my current company help me with this?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"let's lookout"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Is my finance aligns with my expenses for next year?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No, let's lookout." (Indian folks are aware of how unstable our economy is. Hence, every year we have to look at our salary and expenses to see where we are standing?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Is there is anything new and challenging coming my way?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No, let's lookout."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-which-role-i-am-going-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Which Role I am going for?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. I am joining as Engineering Manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-why-engineering-manager-and-not-an-architect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Why Engineering manager and not an architect?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. In my last company, I got promoted from tech-lead to manager. It was a hybrid role, where I was doing technical, architect, and management work. I enjoyed working in the hybrid role. Hence, I decided to move to the same role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-was-i-actively-looking-for-a-job-change"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Was I actively looking for a job change?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. No, I wasn't not so actively looking for the job change as I was happy in my current company and role. But I knew that after 2.5 yrs I will go for a job change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I heard from many folks that at a higher level there are fewer openings and once need to search for months &amp;amp; years."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this was the first time I was going to interview for a manager position (As I got promoted at my current place from Tech lead to EM role). I wanted to experience - manager interviews. Hence, I was open if anything comes my way. So, whenever anything came to me organically through &lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt; or any other platform I at least decided to have the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such as Company name, Job Description, Role, Interview process, role and responsibilities, and package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-when-did-i-start-applying"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. When did I start applying?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. I used to randomly apply for jobs on Linkedin. There was not an exact month tbh. (I used to apply only the jobs which have "easy apply" feature). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied for a few places in March 2020. Got a call from only 3 and cleared the interview of 2 companies. Due to COVID19, I thought I should play safe and do not take the risk of change. Hence, I let them go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in June 2020, I got calls &amp;amp; emails from 5 companies. (This time I didn't apply to any of these companies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Fun fact, one of the company was called me in November 2019 took details &amp;amp; went silent, then called in March 2020 took details and again ghosted me, then they called in June 2020 and I thought they will again ghost me but this time they didn't)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-how-did-you-decide-what-you-are-looking-at-for-your-next-company"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. How did you decide what you are looking at for your next company?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: This is very important for me at least. With years of experience, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know what person I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which kind of company I will enjoy working at? (Startup, midsize company, product, service, MNC, etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of culture I am looking at. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this helped me to make up my mind about what I am looking for in my next company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Work-life-balance is a top priority for me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) As a leader for me, it is important- "Does the company understand the empathy before delivery dates?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) What tech they have and how much they are open to new technologies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Do they understand WFH is okay or they think it is a favor they are doing to the employee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Do they look for 9 hours of work hours mandatory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) What project I will be working on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Do they have any issues with my public speaking, blogging, or community work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) What are the problem areas they have currently for which they need my most attention?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-how-many-rounds"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. How many rounds?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this time all Indian company interviews didn't go beyond 4 rounds including/excluding the HR round. I was going for an engineering manager role hence I have always 1-2 extra Leadership round. So, if I have to break down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4 rounds in total&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2/3 Pair Programming rounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Leadership round&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 HR round &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Hiring manager round&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-how-was-the-interview-coding-level"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. How was the interview coding level?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I always look up to interviews to learn from them. For sure they were not traditional interviews asking (I loved this, finally tech interviews are moving far from regular questions) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) How many data types are there in JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) What is the difference between PUT and POST?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I am a fan of pair programming and coding rounds. They were based on JavaScript (no UI frameworks. Yes, you read right no UI frameworks). Few interviews I got different tasks to do in pair programming to build something and not on paper, not on a word doc but actual IDE (well +10 points to the company). In one of the interviews, they gave me the option to write code in any preferred language I decided to stick to JavaScript only. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Tasks-based questions. Build and discuss your approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) They were not at all interested in the output but in my thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) HTML and CSS were as equally important as JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Semantic code ( I got a lot of questions around this. Eg: why X and not Y? What will happen if I use span over p? etc.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Accessibility (+20points to the company who asked about A11Y). They went deep into the accessibility and also discuss how my code is meeting the accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Web Security: I was not having much experience in this but due to my current project I got the chance to learn about this...hence able to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Nodejs and Database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Data Structure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) System design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) How to do code reviews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall if you are working day today as a developer you will find most of the questions are doable and not so hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leadership-round"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Leadership round
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round is very important for me as I am going to be a part of the leadership and working closely with them. As well as, there is no right answer in this round. For me, this round is always the deal breaker...I want to join the company or not by talking to the leaders (PS: I also keep an eye on the vibes interviewers are giving during interviews. I don't want to work with folks who can't make someone comfortable in an interview)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, Here I speak aloud about my way of working as a manager. Such as for me empathy and work-life balance come first for my team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my team is happy and comfortable to work they will go the extra mile to do their work. I don't do micro-management. I trust folks, etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only preparation I did was doing pair programming and discussing DSA with my friends. Rest of the technical part I was doing at my day-to-day job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not at all confident in DSA but I would say it was my luck the interviews I cleared asked only that part which I knew already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-why-did-you-decide-to-move-ahead"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Why did you decide to move ahead?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A- As I mentioned that I was already planning to start looking for a change after 2.5+ years in my current place. The reason was to get myself to extend my domains, especially in Cloud and Backend. At my current place, I was not getting this opportunity and yes the finance part was also what I expected. So, I decided to move ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-can-connect-with-me-at-linkedin-or-follow-me-at-twitter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You can connect with me at &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nehha/"&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt; or follow me at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hellonehha"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>What is NoSQL?  </title>
      <author>ZakiMax</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 02:49:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/zakimax/what-is-nosql-it-s-diffcult-kk-241o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/zakimax/what-is-nosql-it-s-diffcult-kk-241o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our team moving to NoSQL DB for my current project.(I've only used SOL originally...) So I'm going to think about it. Actually we plan to firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are ...&lt;br&gt;
① What's good about NoSQL?&lt;br&gt;
② What's bad about NoSQL?&lt;br&gt;
③ I mean...actually what does SQL mean?&lt;br&gt;
④ How do we design NoSQL DB...what is best practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;① What's good about NoSQL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast processing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier!! to handle scale-out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;② What's bad about NoSQL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data integrity is difficult to maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data processing is difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;③ I mean...actually what does SQL mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A database language for manipulating and defining data.
ex...SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;④ How do we design NoSQL DB...what is best practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't know yet......................&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Every Web Application is the same, the SELID Website</title>
      <author>Michael Landry</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 01:13:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/milandry/every-web-application-is-the-same-the-selid-website-1pea</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/milandry/every-web-application-is-the-same-the-selid-website-1pea</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;google,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apartments.com/"&gt;apartments.com,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/"&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;, have in common?  They are all websites, obviously, but not just that; they all follow the same pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The visitor is presented with a search field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After querying for something, the visitor is then whisked away to a search results page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon clicking on a result, a details page is then presented, usually featuring information and buttons that run off to CRUD something in a database or call some APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, thats it. This sums up pretty much every web application ever made, even the fancy proprietary expensive application your employer is probably building right now.  I like to refer to these as SeLiD websites ( Search, List, Drill down or Details)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next question. What are the acceptable and approved tools and solutions available to software engineers seeking to build a customized web application? Sure, React is pretty amazing, and everyone has heard of AWS, but if every website emerges into the same template every time, then where is the tool that maps to these problems? Businesses want solutions to business problems. Retailers want customers to search, view, and buy merchandise. Property owners want renters to search, view, and rent properties. Software engineers are tasked to build these solutions, and as software engineers, we want to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a search field that combs through and returns matches from a list of records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shove each returned record into a template, then shove those into another list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wire up each record into a detail page that will easily interface into some sort of CRUD SDK and extendable callback middleware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slap some make up on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as 'customization' goes, it should be a simple matter of asking which records are being queried, how should the data be presented, what widgets are going on to the screen, what are these widgets going to do to the data, and how is this thing going to look?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveying the current landscape of software engineering, I don't see this tool, and I observe the following issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The popular 'front end libraries' only solve technical issues, such as synchronizing behavior and state for the web app, which would normally be fine, except that businesses need to have their business solutions solved and not just their technical issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers have to solve and resolve the same problems over and over again for every web application. The same problems common to every app that the usual libraries don't address. These include authentication, authorization, theming, linting, building, containerization deploying, and on and on... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many projects that try to be the 'batteries included' unicorn, but all come up short in some form or fashion. Either they neglect to solve a critical concern, bring too much opinion to bear, too calcified to be extensible, too complicated, too broad, too difficult, and simply not aware of the absurdly common use-cases I have outlined above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this, the Rondo Platform was born. As an engineer, I have come to find certain platforms, libraries, and technologies as being very easy, robust, and extendable, and by combining these with other open source technologies and best practices, we are able to build the Rondo Platform to be as robust, and efficient, and as simple as possible. Simply put, it takes care of all the toil that goes into custom website construction, and allows the engineer to focus on what matters, solving the business need, while leaving extensibility to customize as much as required.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protected Routes (Next js &amp; CRA) simple but efficient</title>
      <author>Ata Parvin Ghods</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 00:47:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/atapg/protected-routes-next-js-cra-simple-but-efficient-2f7o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/atapg/protected-routes-next-js-cra-simple-but-efficient-2f7o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to hide pages/routes from the user and disabling their accessibility to those pages. &lt;br&gt;
In this post I want to show you the easiest way(which I think it is) to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;strong&gt;I will start with create-react-app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create a new app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dom&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Run the created app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// http://localhost:3000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt;In our main component(App.js) we will define our routes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(src/App.js)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-router-dom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NotFound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//this is 404 page btw - no "exact" prop&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/BrowserRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see we will create our route with a custom route component, So let's build that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;strong&gt;Our ProtectedRoute component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(src/ProtectedRoute.js)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userIsLoggedIn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//our user logged in&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Route&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userIsLoggedIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Redirect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;pathname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If our user is not logged in then show the Component(which is loggin page in this case because we don't want logged in user see the login in page), If not &lt;em&gt;Redirect&lt;/em&gt; the user to home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is how we protect route with react-router-dom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Next Js we use HOC(high-order-component)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;strong&gt;Create next app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Create a new app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Run the created app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// http://localhost:3000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt;First We create HOC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(src/HOC/ProtectedRoute)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;next/router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

         &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userIsLoggedIn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

         &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userIsLoggedIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case we say if the user is logged in then redirect to home page else return the component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.&lt;strong&gt;Make our page protected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(src/pages/login.js)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../HOC/ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProtectedRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//wrap our component in hoc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's all you need! Thank you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I'm going to show you how to disable a repository in Azure DevOps and prevent users from accessing its contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#video"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Video
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, if you are a &lt;strong&gt;visual learner&lt;/strong&gt;, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have &lt;strong&gt;the video with the whole explanation and demo&lt;/strong&gt;, which to be fair is much &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;more complete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; than this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_um1mm7LiM"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/G_um1mm7LiM"&gt;Link to the video: https://youtu.be/G_um1mm7LiM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you rather prefer reading, well... let's just continue :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-disabling-repos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Disabling Repos?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about how to disable a repo, why would you want to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for example you may want to disable a repository because you found a secret in it. Or a third-party scanning tool found the repository to be out of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such cases, you may want to temporarily disable the repository while you work to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-disable-a-repo-in-azure-devops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Disable a Repo in Azure DevOps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see now how to disable a repo. It is very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just go to the &lt;code&gt;Project Settings&lt;/code&gt;, scroll down to the &lt;code&gt;Repositories&lt;/code&gt; section and enter it, then click on the specific repo you want to Disable. In the settings, you have the &lt;code&gt;Disable Repo&lt;/code&gt; switch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RSY7CPB2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6jn7q4mtcrydlfl29z0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RSY7CPB2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6jn7q4mtcrydlfl29z0.png" alt="Disable a Repo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a repo is disabled, it still shows up in the list of repos, however no one can access or update its content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you would also see a message saying that the repo has been disabled when they try to access it in the Azure Repos UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m04TQ9En--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u8kwc99oklp2828z7090.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m04TQ9En--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u8kwc99oklp2828z7090.png" alt="Disabled Message"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course after the necessary mitigation steps have been taken, disabled repositories can be re-enabled using the same setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final note: you can disable a repository only if you are either admin or owner, or you have the Delete repository permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comment section below if you think this is useful and if you've ever been in a situation in which you could have disabled a repo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to get started with improving site performance</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/petermekhaeil/how-to-get-started-with-improving-site-performance-mg1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are so many articles online and so many techniques on improving site performance - where does one start on learning how to improve the performance of a website?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to break it into 3 sections that should be explored:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#know-your-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Know your application
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your application is like a high-performance car owned by a motor sport team. How does the team improve their lap times? By improving the cars performance. How does the team improve the cars performance? By first knowing what is in your car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get to know what is in your application, get to know what is being bundled inside because the size of your script files will have an impact on performance and reducing bundle size is one of the first techniques I recommend to getting started on improving site performance. Most modern web applications are bundled with many dependencies and the first step in knowing what to improve is by first knowing what libraries are being imported into your application. Get curious about the size of your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first tools that I started using is &lt;a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer"&gt;webpack-bundle-analyzer&lt;/a&gt;. It generates a report of the output of your webpack build which visualises the filesize of your JavaScript files and what libraries are included in each file. Here is an example screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MWH8xxt4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-bundle.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MWH8xxt4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-bundle.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we know what is in our application. What can we do with this information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see &lt;code&gt;lodash&lt;/code&gt; takes a large portion of the file. Lodash was one of the first libraries that got me interested in reducing bundle size because it was always included in projects when I first started in my software development career. This is where my curiosity kicked in - why was it so large every time, regardless of the functions that I was using?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some researching, I came to learn that how you import your dependencies, and how your dependencies were build makes a difference. Using &lt;code&gt;lodash&lt;/code&gt; as an example - the package is not &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking"&gt;tree-shakable&lt;/a&gt;. So instead of doing this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isEqual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;lodash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importing the features directly would avoid the complete package from being imported into the bundle:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;difference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;lodash/difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isEqual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;lodash/isEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DbuTy2yP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-bundle-2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DbuTy2yP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-bundle-2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that instead of the whole package being imported, only the modules that were required are being imported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique doesn't work for every library because it depends on how it is built. The idea here is - get curious about the size of your application. Understand the dependencies being imported and why are they are being imported. There could be better ways to import only the code you need for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great tool to help you know the size of a packages is &lt;a href="https://bundlephobia.com/"&gt;Bundlephobia&lt;/a&gt;. It's great for times when you want to know the filesize cost of a package before importing it into your application. It also suggests similar libraries and the filesize comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example - if you look at the bundle report above, you will see &lt;code&gt;moment&lt;/code&gt; being imported and it looks large enough for us to investigate if it can be reduced. Bundlephobia will suggest smaller packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tkA0Hbr2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-moment.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tkA0Hbr2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-moment.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;moment&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;dayjs&lt;/code&gt;, a much smaller alternative with very similar API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gcIitbHA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-bundle-3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gcIitbHA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/bundlephobia-bundle-3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the bundle size, I was able to drop the JavaScript filesize from 868.16 KB to 151.43 KB (83% smaller bundle!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small note: &lt;code&gt;moment&lt;/code&gt; was a popular library before it went into &lt;a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/"&gt;maintenance mode&lt;/a&gt; - highly recommend you to start using the other alternative libraries instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#know-your-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Know your HTML
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to the basics. A HTML page has a &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; is used for the "metadata" of the page, information that is not rendered. &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; is the document that is being rendered to the viewer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My Website&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./fancy-script.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./really-large-stylesheet.css"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to my little place in the web.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where you place your JavaScript and stylesheets has an impact on how your page renders. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the example above is considered render-blocking. Which means they must be loaded and processed before the browser renders the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? Because browsers follow rules to determine if a resource is render-blocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/#which-urls-get-flagged-as-render-blocking-resources"&gt;A web.dev article on Eliminate render-blocking resources&lt;/a&gt; explains perfectly the rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not have a &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not have an &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="stylesheet"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not have a &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute. When this attribute is present, the browser does not download the stylesheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not have a &lt;code&gt;media&lt;/code&gt; attribute that matches the user's device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this knowledge and the techniques explains in the article - The HTML sample from above can be improved:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My Website&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Defer non critical scripts not required for first render --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./fancy-script.js"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;defer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Inline critical styling required for first render --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;style &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Preload stylesheets not required for first render --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"preload"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./non-critical-stylesheet.css"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;as=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"style"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;onload=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world!&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welcome to my little place in the web.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the HTML source code of projects or your favourite websites and see if there are ways that the scripts and stylesheets can be re-arranged to improve the site performance. This can be a great way to get started and get familiar with how browsers handle resource requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#know-your-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Know your tools
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools that can help you get started on improving site performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#google-lighthouse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse"&gt;Google Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provides insights on best practices for your websites. It can run from Chrome DevTools or from a CLI. It scores your website on the Core Web Vitals and also provides suggestions on how to improve page load speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great place to start. Run it on your own websites to get familiar with some of the suggestions reported and use them to explore many other techniques in improving performance. The suggestions also link to &lt;a href="https://web.dev/"&gt;web.dev&lt;/a&gt; articles that go in details on why these suggestions are listed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lighthouse reports on &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/speed-tools/#lab_data"&gt;Lab Data&lt;/a&gt; which means the scores may change each time depending on &lt;a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/variability.md"&gt;network conditions&lt;/a&gt;, so do remember to run it a few times before finalising any solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hxp47oOb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/perf-tools-lighthouse.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Hxp47oOb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/perf-tools-lighthouse.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pagespeed-insights"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"&gt;PageSpeed Insights&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses the performance of a website and generates a report that provides suggestions on what can be improved. It provides Lab Data powered by Google Lighthouse and is always updated when a new version of Lighthouse is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also reports on &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/speed-tools/#field_data"&gt;Field Data&lt;/a&gt; from real users collected from &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/"&gt;Chrome UX Report&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great way to report on how your users are experiencing your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Np0ul6Cy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/perf-tools-pagespeed-insights.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Np0ul6Cy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/perf-tools-pagespeed-insights.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#webpagetest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/"&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures your website performance using different locations, different browsers and different devices. It runs three tests and provides a summary which includes a waterfall view that chronological lists all the resources that were downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other features that will come useful to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can generate &lt;a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/video/"&gt;videos comparison&lt;/a&gt; of how your website loads against other sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlights which element on the page was the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/lcp/"&gt;largest contentful paint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generates videos of any &lt;a href="https://web.dev/cls/"&gt;layout shifts&lt;/a&gt; that occurs on your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waterfall view is very useful in understanding the load times of each resources being downloaded and which were potentially blocking you from having a faster website. For example - when running a test on my site, we can see 2 resources were downloaded before first render:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RmDbMFiA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/perf-tools-webpagetest.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RmDbMFiA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://petermekhaeil.com/images/uploads/perf-tools-webpagetest.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can improve the load times even further by inlining the critical styling and lazy loading the image because it is found at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go a little further with WebPageTest in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/petermekhaeil/page-speed-comparison-of-singapore-commerce-1go6"&gt;Page Speed Comparison of Singapore Commerce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-to-go-from-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where to go from here?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.dev/"&gt;web.dev&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to learn everything you need on making your websites faster. Start with the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/fast/"&gt;Fast load times&lt;/a&gt; to learn techniques on improving site performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you got a hang over some of those techniques, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/metrics/"&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt; course to learn the metrics used to report on site performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are ready, head over to the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/"&gt;Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt; course to learn all about the Core Web Vitals and why these metrics are important for a great user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-assumptions-before-you-continue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Assumptions before you continue...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know basic data structures(&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tuple&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;) in python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with NumPy Basics. If not, check out my &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LfnZfuwNhFqiNBNDhUdAtVjAc44eyduG?usp=sharing"&gt;colab&lt;/a&gt; notebook where I have explained it from the ground up :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have already setup your Data Science environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-pandas-if-we-already-have-numpy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Pandas if we already have NumPy?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numpy has the following limitations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No support for column names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;datatype of all elements must be the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No pre-built methods for common analysis tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandas can handle a large amount of data at ease!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandas&lt;/strong&gt; library overcomes the limitations of &lt;strong&gt;NumPy&lt;/strong&gt;, and sometimes it is also referred to as a &lt;strong&gt;swis army knife&lt;/strong&gt; of Data Analysis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't you worry about losing the &lt;strong&gt;vectorization&lt;/strong&gt; power, &lt;strong&gt;Pandas&lt;/strong&gt; is built upon &lt;strong&gt;NumPy&lt;/strong&gt; so internally, it makes use of &lt;strong&gt;NumPy&lt;/strong&gt; code extensively!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wuX8_G-o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/as7q7yglo9df9lty0a9a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wuX8_G-o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/as7q7yglo9df9lty0a9a.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By the way, the above image is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an over-exaggeration of pandas' capabilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough of the theory, let me show you some code otherwise you might leave this blog 😛 So fire up your Jupyter notebook/lab or whatever IDE you use for Data Science and let's start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we are going to use a dataset on &lt;em&gt;pokemon&lt;/em&gt; to keep things fun and interesting 🐬 You can find it on &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420"&gt;kaggle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introducing-the-pandas-dataframe"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introducing the Pandas Dataframe
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the primary data structure provided by &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;. Formally, a &lt;code&gt;Dataframe&lt;/code&gt; is a 2-Dimensional labeled tabular data structure. It is a &lt;strong&gt;2D&lt;/strong&gt; NumPy array on steroids 💪🏻 in a way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how you read a CSV file as a pandas &lt;code&gt;Dataframe&lt;/code&gt; by passing the file path to the &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#it's a convention to import pandas as 'pd'
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#read a dataset on pokemon stats
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pokemon_stats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"pokemon_stats.csv"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pokemon_stats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#since it's jupyternotebook, no need of print
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zZC1RQk8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/isknhe6cvirdnvhf6tla.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zZC1RQk8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/isknhe6cvirdnvhf6tla.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;💡 The file path can be &lt;strong&gt;relative&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see a table of this sort in your jupyter notebook. (Not all the rows(1028) and columns(51) so that your entire screen is not occupied!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a &lt;code&gt;read_excel()&lt;/code&gt; function if your dataset is in excel spreadsheet form.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#read excel file as a dataframe
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_excel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"path/to/my_dataset.xlsx"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;🗒️ whenever I say &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;, I am referring to &lt;code&gt;Dataframe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#displaying-first-and-last-few-rows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Displaying first and last few rows
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a common practice to have a quick glance at some rows from beginning or end. &lt;br&gt;
For this, we have &lt;code&gt;df.head(n=5)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;df.tail(n=5)&lt;/code&gt; methods where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;number of rows&lt;/em&gt; to display and its default value is 5.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#display first four rows
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pokemon_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bx5BJLcd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/naigxvvolmoml5cr7hf9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bx5BJLcd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/naigxvvolmoml5cr7hf9.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#display last four rows
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pokemon_stats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iX50dXdv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jw3zyx37mga0515v2ejb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iX50dXdv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jw3zyx37mga0515v2ejb.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll go into the anatomy of &lt;code&gt;Dataframe&lt;/code&gt; in the next post. You will get to know that it's more than just a table. Until then, enjoy data science!&lt;/p&gt;

  Bonus: Where Pandas shine 🌟
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is useful whenever the data is &lt;strong&gt;structured&lt;/strong&gt; - data stored in CSV files, excel files, database tables, or simply whenever there is a notion of &lt;em&gt;rows&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;columns&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚠️ There was a bit of jargon involved in the explanations but don't worry we are going to visit these concepts again and again in forthcoming posts :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How does Virtual DOM work? (Build your own)</title>
      <author>Aiden Bai</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 23:09:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aidenybai/how-does-virtual-dom-work-b74</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aidenybai/how-does-virtual-dom-work-b74</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plug: I help develop &lt;a href="https://github.com/millionjs/million"&gt;&lt;code&gt;million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;lt;1kb virtual DOM - it's fast!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual DOM is a tree of virtual nodes that represents what the DOM looks like. virtual nodes are light, stateless, and are JavaScript objects that only contain necessary fields. virtual nodes can be assembled into trees, and "diffed" to make pinpoint changes to the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind this is because modification and access of DOM nodes is computationally expensive. A diff between virtual nodes, accessing the DOM only for modification, is the premise of virtual DOM. It avoids the DOM as much as possible, favoring plain JavaScript objects instead, making reading and writing much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Million virtual DOM contains three main functions: &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt;. To completely understand how virtual DOM works, let's try and create our own rudimentary virtual DOM based off of these functions (&lt;strong&gt;~7 minutes read time&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start, we need to define what a virtual node is. A virtual node can either be a JavaScript object (virtual element) or a string (text).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; function is a helper function that creates virtual elements. A virtual element contains three properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt;: which stores the tag name of the element as a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt;: which stores the properties/attributes of the element as an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;children&lt;/code&gt;: which stores virtual node children of the element as an array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example implementation of the &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; helper function is below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, we can construct virtual nodes easily:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Is the same as:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; function turns a virtual node into a real DOM element. This is important because we'll be using this in our &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; function and the user may also use it to initialize their application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll need to programmatically create a new detached DOM element, then iterate over the virtual element props while adding them to the DOM element, and finally iterating over the children, initialling them as well. An example implementation of the &lt;code&gt;createElement&lt;/code&gt; helper function is below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTextNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Catch if vnode is just text&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;vnode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, we can convert virtual nodes to DOM elements easily:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Is the same as: &amp;lt;div id="app"&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; function takes an existing DOM element, old virtual node, and new virtual node. This won't necessarily be the most performant implementation, but this is just for demonstration purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll need to diff the two virtual nodes, then replace out the element when needed. We do this by first determining whether one of the virtual nodes is a text, or a string, and replacing it if the old and new virtual nodes do not equate each other. Otherwise, we can safely assume both are virtual elements. After that, we diff the tag and props, and replace the element if the tag has changed. We then iterate over the children and recursively patch if a child is a virtual element. An example implementation of the &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt; helper function is below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replaceWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Handle text case&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Diff tag&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Diff props&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Diff children&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;childNodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, we can patch DOM elements based on virtual nodes easily:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Goodbye World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;oldVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// el will become: &amp;lt;div id="app"&amp;gt;Goodbye World&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old virtual node must always model the DOM element until after it is patched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, applications aren't directly written with these methods, rather they should be abstracted out into components and JSX for simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not the same as Million's implementation, rather it is a demonstration to better allow you to understand how the virtual DOM works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-whats-unique-about-million-then"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So... What's unique about Million then?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Million provides five major improvements: granular patching, fewer iterative passes, fast text interpolation, keyed virtual nodes, compiler flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Granular patching:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of just replacing the entire element when there is a difference in props or children, only the necessary props are changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fewer iterative passes:&lt;/strong&gt; Million attempts to reduce the amount of passes during diffing, allowing for better time and space complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fast text interpolation:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of replacing text nodes with DOM methods, Million uses compiler flags to set the &lt;code&gt;textContent&lt;/code&gt; of elements to boost performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Keyed virtual elements:&lt;/strong&gt; This allows for the patching algorithm to skip nodes if the new virtual element key is the same as the old one, minimizing the amount of unnecessary work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Compiler Flags:&lt;/strong&gt; This allows for the patching algorithm to skip condition branches, meaning less work is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Data Structures in Typescript - Stack</title>
      <author>Ricardo Borges</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 22:58:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ricardo93borges/data-structures-in-typescript-stack-1h35</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ricardo93borges/data-structures-in-typescript-stack-1h35</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A stack uses LIFO (last-in-first-out) ordering, the most recent item added is the first item to be removed, just like a real stack.&lt;br&gt;
Some uses of this data structure are expressions evaluations and conversion (prefix, postfix, and infix), backtracking, and memory management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BKCHctW---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/dje4crtui/image/upload/v1622906576/data%2520structures/stack_rccvuz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BKCHctW---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/dje4crtui/image/upload/v1622906576/data%2520structures/stack_rccvuz.png" alt="stack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#representation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Representation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic operations
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Push&lt;/strong&gt; - Add an item to the top of the stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pop&lt;/strong&gt; - Remove the top item from the stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Peek&lt;/strong&gt; - Return the top of the stack, without removing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;isEmpty&lt;/strong&gt; - Return true if the stack is empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;isFull&lt;/strong&gt; - Return true if the stack is full, used when the stack is fixed size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an implementation of a stack using an array, in Typescript an array doesn't have a fixed length, so the operation &lt;strong&gt;isFull&lt;/strong&gt; is not required, however you can implement a stack with a fixed length and use that operation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;EmptyStackException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;peek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;EmptyStackException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>How a Single Mathematical question lead to the Invention of Modern Computers? </title>
      <author>Danyson</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 22:38:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/danyson/how-a-single-mathematical-question-lead-to-the-invention-of-modern-computers-2087</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/danyson/how-a-single-mathematical-question-lead-to-the-invention-of-modern-computers-2087</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 1900s German Mathematician David Hilbert put forward a question : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-mathematics-decidable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is Mathematics "Decidable"?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means "is there an Algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows the axioms?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1936 Alan Turing answered this question by inventing the Modern Computer, the Turing Machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ran his famous "Halting problem" on his Turing Machine to check whether a program will halt or not on a particular input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#turing-found-out-his-halting-problem-and-hilberts-decidablity-problem-are-similar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Turing found out his Halting Problem and Hilbert's Decidablity Problem are similar.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But results came to Turing such that there is no way to tell in general, if a Turing machine will halt or not on a given input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-experiment-by-turing-answered-that-mathematics-is-undecidable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This experiment by Turing answered that "Mathematics is Undecidable".
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty here is that a visionary question from a Mathematician gave an idea to Turing to Invent the Modern Computer that we use today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#because-you-know-all-the-computers-are-turing-machines-and-all-the-programming-languages-are-in-fact-turing-complete"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Because you know all the computers are Turing Machines and all the  programming languages are in fact Turing complete.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-the-invention-of-modern-computers-computers-were-actually-humans"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before the invention of Modern Computers, Computers were actually Humans.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? Humans? Yes. To say precisely, they are Women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yes-women-mathematical-geniuses-tend-to-do-all-the-computation-works-and-calculations-manually"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yes, Women Mathematical geniuses tend to do all the computation works and calculations manually.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was Turing who replaced them with Machines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional Programming Notes:</title>
      <author>Randy Rivera</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 21:51:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rthefounding/functional-programming-notes-19j6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rthefounding/functional-programming-notes-19j6</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In these upcoming posts, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like &lt;code&gt;.map()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.filter()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learn-about-functioning-programming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learn About Functioning Programming
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: &lt;code&gt;INPUT -&amp;gt; PROCESS -&amp;gt; OUTPUT&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional programming is about:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends and family love tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for them, and store them in the tea4Family variable.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () =&amp;gt; 'greenTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) =&amp;gt; {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups &amp;lt;= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

const tea4Family = getTea(40); &amp;lt;----
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understand-functional-programming-terminology"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understand Functional Programming Terminology
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now they also want both green and black tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With that information, we'll need to revisit the &lt;code&gt;getTea&lt;/code&gt; function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify &lt;code&gt;getTea&lt;/code&gt; to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes &lt;code&gt;getTea&lt;/code&gt; more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () =&amp;gt; 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () =&amp;gt; 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) =&amp;gt; {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups &amp;lt;= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4Green = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27); &amp;lt;-----
const tea4Black = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13); &amp;lt;-----
// Only change code above this line

console.log(
  tea4Green,
  tea4Black
); // will display ['greenTea',
  'greenTea',
  'greenTea',
   ....  ['blackTea',
   ....
  'blackTea']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here we just prepared 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in &lt;code&gt;tea4Green&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tea4Black&lt;/code&gt; variables, respectively. Note that the &lt;code&gt;getTea&lt;/code&gt; function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-cover-some-functional-terminology"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  let's cover some functional terminology:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the change of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;(which we will discuss later, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>5 things to do when NOT writing code...</title>
      <author>Carl Wills</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 21:38:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/carlmobiledev/5-things-to-do-when-not-writing-code-5fmp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/carlmobiledev/5-things-to-do-when-not-writing-code-5fmp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As programmers, we love to code! That's what we do, and it's a big part of our lives. But it's not all that we do, and it's not all that we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do as coders. Here are five things that I think everybody that writes code should do when they are not coding to keep themselves sharp and to continue learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-talk-about-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Talk about code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Talk about code, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, anything that helps you learn more about what you are working on. I think as programmers we often get caught up in the typing of code and lose our skills in other ways to communicate about it. One of the most important skills in our toolset is being able to communicate and explain technology, code, or high level strategy that we are using when solving complex problems. Talking about code helps enforce these skills and even helps us figure out which topics we need to brush up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-look-at-code-other-people-wrote"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Look at code other people wrote
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's soooo many benefits to reading other people's code. Everybody has small little intricate differences when they write code that can be fun to explore and enhance your understanding of how the language works. You might notice some cool new functions you've never noticed before. You may stumble on a pattern that they use that you could easily implement into your project to make it cleaner or more simple. You may even find some mistakes! Reading code other people wrote is a great exercise in checking your level of understanding. It's not easy to jump into a new repository and start understanding what's going on, but by taking some time to explore unknown territory, you'll pick up on a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-read"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Read
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read a book, I dare you! You might even enjoy it! Many programmers enjoy doing what they do because it is a very focused, heavy brain-power job. If that's you, &lt;em&gt;or if you simply like a good story&lt;/em&gt; pick up a book and give it a read. You'll find that doing a quiet solitary task can be really refreshing, especially with all the video calls we are all on &lt;strong&gt;constantly&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-pick-up-a-hobby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Pick up a hobby
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers are, in general, great problem solvers. That means that they are naturally clever, creative people. Pick up a hobby that helps get that creativity out! This can be anything from learning a musical instrument, to going out and geocaching. Finding a hobby that you love can be a great way to redirect your focus away from your code and simply let your brain rest. I've met a number of people that then take those hobbies and combine them. Some examples could be writing an app that records music, making a website for your biking club, or even creating a database to keep track of your board game win/loss record with your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-take-a-break"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Take a break
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply taking a break can often be the best thing you can do to keep your energy levels up, stay focused and avoid short term burnout. Personally for me, I love going on walks throughout the day. It get's my body moving and physically away from my desk creating some separation from my work. Maybe for you, reading a chapter in a book might be the best way to relax. Other's might even rather sit back and watch an episode of their favorite show. Breaks are great for hitting the "Brain Reset" button and often times when you get back to coding you can approach it from a different prospective, which can be especially useful when tracking down pesky bugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do to stay sharp and focused when you aren't coding? Let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Carl&lt;/p&gt;
