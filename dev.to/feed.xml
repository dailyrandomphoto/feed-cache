      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is an open source, high-level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s and presently administered by Pythin Software Foundation. It came from the ABC language that he helped create early on in his career. Python is a powerful language that you can use to create games, write GUIs and develop web applications. It is a high level language. Reading and writing codes in python is much like reading and writing regular English statements. Python is an interpreted language which means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code. Python is an object oriented language that allows users to manage and control data structures or objects to create and run programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, procedural, object-oriented and functional programming. Python programs use clear, simple, and concise instructions that are easy to read even by those who have no substantial programming background. Programs written in python are therefore easier to maintain, debug or enhance. Codes used in python are considerably shorter, simpler and less verbose than other high level programming languages . It has a well designed built in features and standard library as well as access to third party modules and source libraries. Python works or runs across all platforms, windows, linux/UNIX, Mac OS, it also works on microcontrollers used in appliances, toys, remote controls, embedded devices, and other similar devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING STARTED&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python can be written in any text editor if you have the interpreter also  installed. Many developers use special programs that are called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)/ IDEs help with finding syntax and exception errors. Examples are Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, PyCharm, Spyder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start writing programs in python, you have to first download the installation package compactible with your OS and computer specs from python official website, &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"&gt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;. After downloading, then install by clicking the .exe file you downlaoded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is a flexible and dynamic language that you can use in different ways. You can use it in script mode when you want to interpret an entire file of statements or application program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to access python’s command line depending on the operating system installed in your computer. If you are using a windows OS, you can start python by clicking on its icon or menu item on the start menu. If you are using GNU/Linux, UNIX, MAC OS systems, you have to run the terminal tool and enter the python command to start your session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how python works, you can use the print command to print the universal program “Yo Good”&lt;br&gt;
Open python’s command line&lt;br&gt;
At the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt, type the following: print(“Yo Good”)&lt;br&gt;
Press enter to tell python that you are done with your command. Very quickly, the command line window will display Yo Good on the following line.&lt;br&gt;
To exit from python, you can type any of these commands: quit() or exit() or Ctr+Z+Enter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PYTHON SYNTAX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python syntax refers to the set of rules that defines how much users and the system should write and interpret a python program. First thing to note are pythin keywords, these are reserved words in python that should not be used as variable, constant, function name, or identifier in your code. Words such as: and, break, continue, global, import, else, except, if, while, from, return, or, etc (check the documentation on &lt;a href="http://www.python.org"&gt;www.python.org&lt;/a&gt; for more keywords).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PYTHON IDENTIFIER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, is identifier; which is a name given to a function, class, variable, module, or other objects that you’ll be using in your python program. Here are python naming conventions you should be aware of:&lt;br&gt;
An identifier can be a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, underscores, and digits (0-9). &lt;br&gt;
Special characters such as %, @ and $ are not allowed within identifiers&lt;br&gt;
An identifier should not begin with a number&lt;br&gt;
Python is a case sensitive language and this behaviour extends to identifiers&lt;br&gt;
Python keywords can’t be used as identifiers&lt;br&gt;
You can use underscores to separate multiple words in your identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PYTHON QUOTATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Python allows the use of quotation marks to indicate string literals. You can use single, double, or triple quotes but you must start and end the string with thesame type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PYTHON STATEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then, we have statements, which are instructions that a python interpreter can execute. When you assign a value to a variable, say pet_var = “lion”, you are  making an assignment statement, you just assigned the string “lion” to the variable “pet_var”. In python there are other statements such as the if statements, while statements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDENTATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Python unlike other languages uses indentation to structure its block of codes. Indentation makes python codes more readable and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Comments are necessary in every programming language for every programmer as you write your codes. Comments are very handy when you have to review or revisit your program. It will also help others who may come across or look through your code to understand. In python you can use the “#” to start a comment. For multi line comments, you can use the triple quotes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Code stability and interdependencies</title>
      <author>Kevin Pennekamp</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/crinklesio/code-stability-and-interdependencies-f1b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As engineers, we have the tendency to over-engineer our solutions, make our code as reusable as possible. We make our code DRY (don't repeat yourself). Although these are good rules to go by in most cases, they can also lead to problematic maintenance issues. In our DRY-quest, we can create unstable, yet reusable code that is used in more than one place. Sometimes it is ok to write our code WET (write everything twice). Why? Because it creates more stable code around interdependencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-stability-rule"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The stability rule
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stability rule is very simple. In this rule, stability means the &lt;em&gt;likeliness the code will change&lt;/em&gt;. Every function, module, or UI component we write, is as stable as the lowest stability of its dependencies. Think about it. If a dependency changes, our code has to (potentially) change as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every function, module, or UI component we write, is as stable as the lowest stability of its dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do you determine the stability of dependencies? This is, unfortunately, no exact science. It depends heavily on the type of dependency as well. We can set third-party packages to fixed version numbers, making them very stable. We can assume browsers API will, &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/google-reverses-embarrassing-website-breaking-chrome-update"&gt;most likely&lt;/a&gt;, not change. But the code we write ourselves can change. You can measure how many times a function/module changes, or you can make a guess how likely it will change. In both cases, you can give a function or module a &lt;em&gt;score&lt;/em&gt; of its stability. With this score, you can create a &lt;em&gt;dependency graph&lt;/em&gt; of your codebase, like the one below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QOvGid0R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lj2cr3s92yy6l4bhupf7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QOvGid0R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lj2cr3s92yy6l4bhupf7.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above graph, we see that 'Function B' is dependent on 'Function A' and 'Package A'. Function B uses Function A and Package A. All elements also got a score attached. The higher the score, the more stable the element. The ones with a keen eye will see the above dependency graph is actually wrong. It does not comply with the stability rule. The score of 'Component A' cannot be 7, as they depend on a function with lower stability. We have either have to update the graph or change our code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#splitting-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Splitting code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on mismatching stability scores, we can find possible improvements. It allows us to reorder code to improve its stability. But, it also allows for conscious decisions to not change anything at all. In our example, it is highly likely that 'Function B' is only unstable because it has some code only used for 'Component B'. At this point we have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split 'Function B' into two functions. One function contains stable code used by both components. Another function contains code used by 'Component B'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate the unstable part of 'Function B' to 'Component B'. This makes 'Function B' smaller, but more stable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't change anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find ourselves with these examples more often than we would like to admit. How many times have you thought: "if I add this option to the function, I can use it here as well". This is the moment where we need to look at the dependencies and their stabilities. Only then will we achieve stable code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#systems-architecture-and-patterns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Systems, architecture, and patterns
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our time spent during development is around unstable code. We focus on implementing UI and features that are each unique and add a different value to a user or business. This makes the code by default less reusable. But, these features are built upon systems, architectural decisions, and patterns. These dependencies allow us to stabilize a certain core of the application. Some examples: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A design system or UI library provides stable low-level UI components that can be used in many different UI components. Think of input fields, buttons, tables, or even cards. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In React you can create generic hooks abstracting low-level logic (e.g. fetching data, including loading state). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardized object validation logic through libraries as &lt;a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup"&gt;Yup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/crinklesio/schematiq#object-validation"&gt;schematiq&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize fetch requests and state management around basic CRUD operations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt an architecture or design patterns (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/crinklesio/reference-architecture"&gt;client-side reference architecture&lt;/a&gt;) that help you determine which parts should be stable. Patterns and consistent architecture help to create imaginary boundaries between functions and modules as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many more ways can be found to stabilize parts of your codebase. Everybody following a recent tutorial knows packages like &lt;code&gt;lodash&lt;/code&gt;. These packages or ideas, regardless if you build them yourself, or download them, help you create maintainable code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining the correct interdependencies on code stability is no exact science. You can measure how often code changes. But, when determining interdependencies, you have to look into the future. You have to determine how &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; code is to change in the future. This is not something you do every day. You are not going to create a dependency graph for each change. But having a sense of stability on various levels helps a lot. You will see the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of your code increase and become more &lt;em&gt;maintainable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making random and unique ID with Javascript</title>
      <author>Maria Antonella 🦋</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 17:27:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/antoomartini/making-random-and-unique-id-with-javascript-4c8c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/antoomartini/making-random-and-unique-id-with-javascript-4c8c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I needed to find a way to generate a unique id to get names for phone files on ios systems. Anyway, googling around, I found this simple function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is call it, where you need to generate the id, and pass the desired length of the id.&lt;br&gt;
And magic! It returns an id made with characters and numbers (in this example, of course!)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const makeRandomId= (length) =&amp;gt; {
      let result = ''
      const characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
      for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; length; i++ ) {
        result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length));
     }
     return result;
  }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;👉 charAt: The charAt() method returns the character at a specified index in a string.&lt;br&gt;
👉 floor(): The floor() method rounds a number DOWNWARDS to the nearest integer, and returns the result.&lt;br&gt;
👉 random(): Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and characters.length (exclusive):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math.random() used with Math.floor() can be used to return random integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gitlab CI/CD for multiple environment</title>
      <author>Santhosh Thomas </author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 17:07:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sats268842/gitlab-ci-cd-for-multiple-environment-54dj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sats268842/gitlab-ci-cd-for-multiple-environment-54dj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you tried implementing variables for various environments and using different jobs for various environments? I've come up with a solution for you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;image: node:latest
variables:
  GIT_DEPTH: '0' 

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

workflow:
    rules:
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME ==  "develop"
        variables:
          DEVELOP: "true"
          ENVIRONMENT_NAME: Develop
          WEBSITE_URL: DEVELOP_WEBSITE_URL
          S3_BUCKET: (develop-s3-bucket-name)
          AWS_REGION: ************** develop
          AWS_ACCOUNT: ********develop

      - if: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME == "main" 
        variables:                                 
          PRODUCTION:  "true"
          ENVIRONMENT_NAME: PRODUCTION
          WEBSITE_URL: $PROD_WEBSITE_URL
          S3_BUCKET: $PROD-S3-BUCKET-NAME
          AWS_REGION: ************** (prod-region)
          AWS_ACCOUNT: ***********(prod-acct)
      - when: always 

build-app:
  stage: build
  script:
     #build-script
  environment: 
    name: $ENVIRONMENT_NAME

deploy-app:
  stage: deploy
  script:
     #deploy-script
  environment: 
    name: $ENVIRONMENT_NAME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB: Please let me know if this procedure is correct. (Experts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VSCode extensions that you need [Webdevs]🚀🔧</title>
      <author>KR Tirtho</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/krtirtho/vscode-extensions-that-you-need-webdevs-2pkp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/krtirtho/vscode-extensions-that-you-need-webdevs-2pkp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;VSCode lover? I know extensions are our life support for coding. And if you're a web dev you're in great luck. Below are some useful extensions/configs that will make you amazed after learning their use-cases &amp;amp; benefits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a small description of the extensions so do not expect full details here. You can learn more info about the extensions from their respective docs/repositories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, all the credit for images &amp;amp; GIFs that are embedded below goes to their respective extension authors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-visual-studio-intellicode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode"&gt;1. Visual Studio IntelliCode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know about Tabnine but do you know Microsoft already provides an AI-powered autocompletion tool? Visual Studio Itellicode is an AI-powered autocompletion tool for AI-enhanced development workflow. It's really lightweight &amp;amp; doesn't require any extra runtime like other autocompletion tools. It uses Microsoft Azure cloud services to process the information instead of local computer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZERO42uu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3Flinkid%3D2006041" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZERO42uu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3Flinkid%3D2006041" alt="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006041"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-html-tag-wrap-abbreviation-emmet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. HTML Tag wrap Abbreviation (Emmet)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can wrap a piece of code with curly braces/brackets/quotes really simply. But that doesn't work for HTML tags. You've to manually write the opening/closing tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But VSCode has a built-in emmet extension. Using this you can do so much stuff &amp;amp; even wrap it with an HTML tag&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how to do it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select the content you want to wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;CTRL+SHIFT+p&lt;/code&gt; then search "Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the first one &amp;amp; type out the HTML tag name e.g &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More precisely, you can set a custom shortcut for the command configuring key-maps using &lt;code&gt;CTRL+k+s&lt;/code&gt; shortcut. Just set your desired key-binding e.g &lt;code&gt;CTRL+k+SHIFT+w&lt;/code&gt; for the command "Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation". Make sure your desired key-binding is not used for other commands or it might remove that command's functionality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-wrap-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/midnightsyntax/vscode-wrap-console-log"&gt;3. Wrap Console&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired of manually writing &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; prefixing with labels to identify the console log coming from which file? Well, this extension gives you the superpower to write the complete console.log with a single shortcut&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports string prefixes, dynamic (you've to type) prefixes or no prefixes at all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ycxjQFtF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/midnightsyntax/vscode-wrap-console-log/raw/master/images/screenshot_log_cursor.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ycxjQFtF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/midnightsyntax/vscode-wrap-console-log/raw/master/images/screenshot_log_cursor.gif" alt="https://github.com/midnightsyntax/vscode-wrap-console-log/raw/master/images/screenshot_log_cursor.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-document-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4&lt;a href="https://github.com/oouo-diogo-perdigao/vscode-docthis"&gt;. Document this&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a JavaScript/Typescript JSDoc generator. Instead of writing javascript doc comments/structures manually, you can inject a prebuilt configurable JSDoc structure with a simple command/shortcut&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FT7z4oA8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/oouo-diogo-perdigao/vscode-docthis/raw/master/images/demo.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FT7z4oA8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/oouo-diogo-perdigao/vscode-docthis/raw/master/images/demo.gif" alt="https://github.com/oouo-diogo-perdigao/vscode-docthis/raw/master/images/demo.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-template-string-converter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5&lt;a href="https://github.com/meganrogge/template-string-converter"&gt;. Template string converter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's really annoying to covert normal strings to template strings when you've to concat other strings into that string. This is where template-string-converter makes life a breeze&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4Ux83trE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meganrogge/template-string-converter/master/src/images/demo.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4Ux83trE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meganrogge/template-string-converter/master/src/images/demo.gif" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meganrogge/template-string-converter/master/src/images/demo.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-es7-reactreduxreactnativejs-snippets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6&lt;a href="https://github.com/dsznajder/vscode-es7-javascript-react-snippets"&gt;. ES7 React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7+ with Babel plugin features for VS Code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your React/React-Native component is only one snippet way thanks to this awesome snippet extension. It offers all the cool snippets for generating boilerplate code for redux &amp;amp; react components. Also offers new ES7 syntax-related snippets. Saves a lot of time while creating react components. It supports Typescript too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-drawio-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7&lt;a href="https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio"&gt;. Draw.io integration&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fan of popular diagram application &lt;a href="http://diagrams.net"&gt;diagrams.net&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as &lt;a href="http://draw.io"&gt;draw.io&lt;/a&gt;)? Well, you don't have to install any application/visit the website to create/edit/open diagrams. You can do this in VSCode. As draw.io is web-based &amp;amp; vscode runs on top of Electron thus it can be run easily inside VSCode. &lt;em&gt;It supports collaborative editing too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PwLFDudz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://szymonkrajewski.pl/drawio-real-time-collaboration-in-vscode/cover.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PwLFDudz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://szymonkrajewski.pl/drawio-real-time-collaboration-in-vscode/cover.jpg" alt="https://szymonkrajewski.pl/drawio-real-time-collaboration-in-vscode/cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-error-lens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8&lt;a href="https://github.com/usernamehw/vscode-error-lens"&gt;. Error lens&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired of hovering over variable/function/instance names to read the error message? Well, error-lens saves you. Instead of showing error info on hover, it'd show it on the right of the error occurring place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fVAiCe5e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usernamehw/vscode-error-lens/master/img/demo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fVAiCe5e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usernamehw/vscode-error-lens/master/img/demo.png" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usernamehw/vscode-error-lens/master/img/demo.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-path-intellisense"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9&lt;a href="https://github.com/ChristianKohler/PathIntellisense"&gt;. Path Intellisense&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most time-saving extension I've ever found. It autocompletes paths on strings based on the relative path. Also shows every file/folder with its appropriate icon (works with 3rd party icons too). Works with any language/file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/iaHeUiDeTUZuo.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/iaHeUiDeTUZuo.gif" alt="https://i.giphy.com/iaHeUiDeTUZuo.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-indent-rainbow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10&lt;a href="https://github.com/oderwat/vscode-indent-rainbow"&gt;. Indent Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indentation is really confusing &amp;amp; even though it's nothing much but it always troubles so this extension fixes this all with colors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vPpXGbnL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oderwat/vscode-indent-rainbow/master/assets/example.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vPpXGbnL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oderwat/vscode-indent-rainbow/master/assets/example.png" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oderwat/vscode-indent-rainbow/master/assets/example.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-todo-tree"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11&lt;a href="https://github.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree"&gt;. Todo tree&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to find the TODO comments in the project. Sometimes I found certain Todos 1/2 months after writing😅. VSCode Todo Tree helps you find &amp;amp; navigate all the comments starting with the &lt;code&gt;TODO:&lt;/code&gt; clause. It works for every programming languages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iNcMLghs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree/master/resources/screenshot.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iNcMLghs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree/master/resources/screenshot.png" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree/master/resources/screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-intellisense-for-css-class-names-in-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/Zignd/HTML-CSS-Class-Completion"&gt;12. IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These extensions autocompletes locally declared CSS class names in HTML &amp;amp; HTML like Files (JSX, Vue, pug etc..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RwQneOFL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/5crMfTj.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RwQneOFL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/5crMfTj.gif" alt="https://i.imgur.com/5crMfTj.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-styled-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components/raw/HEAD/demo.gif"&gt;13. Styled components&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for CSS in JS (CSS syntax highlighting/autocomplete). Even though it's created for &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt; library but it works with other libraries well if these are using string literals for declaring styles. Only works with functions named like &lt;code&gt;styled.&amp;lt;html-tagname&amp;gt;\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;, `styled\`\&lt;/code&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;css\&lt;/code&gt;``&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jwfxzT72--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components/raw/HEAD/demo.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jwfxzT72--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components/raw/HEAD/demo.gif" alt="https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components/raw/HEAD/demo.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#14-emojisense"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/mattbierner/vscode-emojisense"&gt;14. :emojisense:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autocompletion for emojis in VS Code. Surprisingly it works in the comment box of the Git Integration Tab too. That means you can commit with emojis too. Commenting with emojis makes the comment more descriptive &amp;amp; this extension makes it easier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CNXQY-fx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattbierner/vscode-emojisense/master/media/example.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CNXQY-fx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattbierner/vscode-emojisense/master/media/example.gif" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattbierner/vscode-emojisense/master/media/example.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#15-code-spell-checker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker"&gt;15. Code Spell Checker&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code. An awesome must-use extension to keep your code user-friendly &amp;amp; safe from typos. You can even create your own word library by saving unknown yet right words. Also provides suggestions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1BdiHt2K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/main/images/suggestions.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1BdiHt2K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/main/images/suggestions.gif" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/main/images/suggestions.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#16-color-highlight"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/naumovs/vscode-ext-color-highlight"&gt;16. Color Highlight&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension styles CSS/web colors found in any file. Extremely useful for frontend developers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--irvN1V6f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://naumovs.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/naumovs/color-highlight/2.5.0/1631530639439/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--irvN1V6f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://naumovs.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/naumovs/color-highlight/2.5.0/1631530639439/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default" alt="https://naumovs.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/naumovs/color-highlight/2.5.0/1631530639439/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#17-auto-rename-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  17. &lt;a href="https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-rename-tag"&gt;Auto Rename Tag&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's common to rename/change your HTML tags. But it wastes a lot of time. With auto rename tag you can easily edit both starting &amp;amp; ending tags by editing only either one of 'em&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--btV6ZCG6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-rename-tag/raw/HEAD/images/usage.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--btV6ZCG6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-rename-tag/raw/HEAD/images/usage.gif" alt="https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-rename-tag/raw/HEAD/images/usage.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After VSCode 1.60 update there's a new feature called &lt;strong&gt;linked-editing&lt;/strong&gt; that might replace the use case of this extension. But you've to manually activate the mode by shortcut or command pallet where this extension just works. But as always, it's your choice what you want to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#18-sql-tools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools"&gt;18. SQL Tools&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to run simple queries/insertions/update/delete? Why always have to open the DB Administration Application? It takes time &amp;amp; resources to startup. Also hurts the developer experience. But VSCode SQL Tools solves this problem. Simple &amp;amp; easy SQL statements can be run easily against any SQL database. Just install the driver extension &amp;amp; you're good to go. It even supports autocomplete for the currently connected database&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uQlGx67P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.apexsql.com/sliderslick/images/PowerToolsVSCode/Export-query-results-from-the-results-grid.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uQlGx67P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.apexsql.com/sliderslick/images/PowerToolsVSCode/Export-query-results-from-the-results-grid.png" alt="https://www.apexsql.com/sliderslick/images/PowerToolsVSCode/Export-query-results-from-the-results-grid.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#19-mongodb-for-vs-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode"&gt;19. MongoDB for VS Code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like SQLTools but for NoSQL MongoDB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QU_ltgN1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode/raw/main/resources/screenshots/explore-data.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QU_ltgN1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode/raw/main/resources/screenshots/explore-data.png" alt="https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode/raw/main/resources/screenshots/explore-data.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#20-regex-previewer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/chrmarti/vscode-regex"&gt;20. Regex Previewer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total life-saver extension. Only grown men/women know the pain of creating regex as there is no way to know if it'll work until running it. But this extension lets one create regex separately, interactively &amp;amp; super quickly. Just write the regex in your file &amp;amp; write the words/sentences that you want to match with that regex&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yB_cI-ws--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrmarti/vscode-regex/raw/main/images/in_action.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yB_cI-ws--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrmarti/vscode-regex/raw/main/images/in_action.gif" alt="https://github.com/chrmarti/vscode-regex/raw/main/images/in_action.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all folks. Hope you like it &amp;amp; don't be unhappy if you're using 30-40+ extensions. As a developer, I can guarantee you extensions are our life support🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pull Requests Like a PRO: Tips to Make High-Quality Pull Requests</title>
      <author>Navendu Pottekkat</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:28:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/navendu/pull-requests-like-a-pro-tips-to-make-high-quality-pull-requests-2hfk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/navendu/pull-requests-like-a-pro-tips-to-make-high-quality-pull-requests-2hfk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Hacktoberfest around the corner, here are some tips to make better Pull Requests for your next Open-Source contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a maintainer and a contributor to Open-Source projects these are the things I look for when reviewing and take care of when submitting Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fast read but if you want one even faster, check out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sudo_navendu/status/1437456596473303042"&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-1-contributing-docs-are-your-best-friends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 1: Contributing Docs are your Best Friends
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Open-Source projects have a contributing doc(usually a &lt;a href="https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt; file at the root of the repo) that contains all the necessary details on how to set up your development environment, coding conventions you have to follow and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to contribute to a project, that should be the next place to look into after the &lt;a href="https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme"&gt;ReadME&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Mt1sx_3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dh3n0tmz2y2gle49ewav.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Mt1sx_3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dh3n0tmz2y2gle49ewav.png" alt="A screenshot showing the contributing guide of the Meshery project in GitHub."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Contributing doc from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/meshery/meshery"&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-2-document-your-prs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 2: Document Your PRs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really important. I repeat this is really important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should make the reviewing process as easy as possible and a reviewer should be able to get the context of your PR with a quick glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write self-documenting code (What is self-documenting code and how can it help? See &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/209089/12424846"&gt;this great answer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use comments liberally in your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write clear commit messages and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, comment what your PR does clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown below, the PR description shows what issue it fixes, the change made in the PR and the actual new User-Experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the PR very easy to review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6VeNnKBr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oqb563b2yjo9nie1rxzi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6VeNnKBr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oqb563b2yjo9nie1rxzi.png" alt="A screenshot of a pull request description from GitHub showing how to document your PRs."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Pull Request description example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-3-use-pull-request-templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 3: Use Pull Request Templates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Open-Source projects will have a Pull Request template to guide newcomers and veterans alike into documenting their PRs properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, the PR template has sections where the contributors are expected to fill details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y5Hz5SJ5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/knvukchmgvajbzil8390.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y5Hz5SJ5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/knvukchmgvajbzil8390.png" alt="A screenshot of a pull request template from Microsoft's Open Service Mesh project."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pull Request template from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm"&gt;Open Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would make the job of the reviewer much easier as they would be able to easily test it out, ask a domain expert to review and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These also acts like a checklist that the contributor can tick off. For example: Questions like &lt;em&gt;"Did I write unit tests?", "Did I sign all of my commits?", "Is this a breaking change?"&lt;/em&gt; can be answered as you start filling the template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-4-make-your-prs-small-and-focused"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 4: Make your PRs Small and Focused
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, your Pull Requests should do one thing and one thing only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with addressing multiple concerns in a single PR is that the reviewer &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; not agree with all the changes and this could potentially lead to long discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So small and focused PRs would reduce the time taken for reviews and would make your PR most likely to get merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sjMRtLP8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/klteluhjfn90k2hfe7to.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sjMRtLP8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/klteluhjfn90k2hfe7to.png" alt="A screenshot showing a pull request in GitHub that focuses on one thing."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;An Example Pull Request with just a single, focused change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-5-add-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 5: Add Tests
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the project you are working on has automated tests, then make sure that you add tests for the code you are adding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if you should write tests? Here is a &lt;strong&gt;bonus tip&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it can be tested, it should be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-6-make-sure-the-automated-tests-pass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 6: Make sure the Automated Tests Pass
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most projects have automated tests in their CI/CD pipelines which run on your Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tests are in place to make sure that the code you are adding passes some constraints. These are mostly lint checks, build checks, unit tests and integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these checks are not passing, fix it and make sure all the tests pass before asking for a review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your code is not likely to get merged if these checks fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IcRMxLN8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj5w3yqu7v4627wdpeyd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IcRMxLN8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj5w3yqu7v4627wdpeyd.png" alt="A screenshot showing a pull request in GitHub that focuses on one thing."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All checks passed!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-7-respond-to-feedback"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 7: Respond to Feedback
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you open a Pull Request, you are also opening a discussion on why this change is needed and why your PR is the right way to add that change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, make sure that you respond to reviews, make changes to your PR as suggested by the reviewer and ask for clarification questions if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would make sure that you and the reviewer are on the same page and would make the PR reviews much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_Xdv2nWy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uqkme7w60iijpiv8okv7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_Xdv2nWy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uqkme7w60iijpiv8okv7.png" alt="A screenshot showing a pull request in GitHub that focuses on one thing."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sometimes discussions can get really long! But these are necessary when you are adding a new feature with breaking changes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-8-be-patient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 8: Be Patient
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Open-Source maintainers are volunteers. They maintain projects during their free time off from their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they may take some time to get to your PR and review it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be patient while they do their thing. Take a break, drink a cup of coffee and watch Naruto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be writing about Contributing to, Building, Scaling and Maintaining Open-Source projects here on the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/navendu"&gt;DEV Community&lt;/a&gt; as well as on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sudo_navendu"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://navendu.me/"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this last year, I have went from a noob Open-Source contributor to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building &lt;a href="https://github.com/nsfw-filter/nsfw-filter"&gt;my own project&lt;/a&gt; and making it to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sudo_navendu/status/1298191582101778433"&gt;#1 Trending Repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining 2 &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/"&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; Projects and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working &lt;a href="https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat"&gt;full-time&lt;/a&gt; in Open-Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to share everything I've learned to help as many people as possible who are interested in Open-Source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, follow along and may the source be with you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we gonna build a twitter bot in Python with Tweepy, a very nice library to invoke the Twitter API. You will learn how to retrieve data from Twitter and automatize your tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#twitter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Twitter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2009 when I create my first Twitter account I remember Twitter still being a place to complain about life with strangers, tell how much depressive you feel, not sharing your user with your family and so on. You were limited to write in 140 characters without any other type of information attached such as photo (unless you used another place to host to your pictures and post the link on Twitter). Yeah, a lot has changed since those old days and everybody can say Twitter is one of the most  popular and not boring social network on nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1RDwfwvX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4svqbk3k58xeug7uya75.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1RDwfwvX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4svqbk3k58xeug7uya75.png" alt="Twitter fail whale"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is used today for many things, from voting for awards, promoting protests, drawing the world's attention to some catastrophic situation, sharing memes, FAKE NEWS, revealing talent and even reporting crimes in inaccessible or unsafe places, contributing a lot to journalistic work and of the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g-A1pjrI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zwjlp2o74xlss5cncd7w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g-A1pjrI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zwjlp2o74xlss5cncd7w.png" alt="wtf is Covfefe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is a place full of users of different ages, but predominantly young, large companies use twitter for advertising, sales and, of course, answering possible complaints about their products in an automated and 'modern' way, full of memes of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ciLCrsD---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zpdgo1y5r0u7wvfeg9wo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ciLCrsD---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zpdgo1y5r0u7wvfeg9wo.png" alt="Naraze Tedesco"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#badly-programmed-bot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Badly programmed bot
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing use of bots is notable from well-programmed ones to big flops. As in the case of the Brazilian company Decolar, which responded to the user by referring to him/her through his 'nickname', which was a loophole for people to put insults in his name and make the company's official profile tweet the insult when responding, the user changed its nickname and printed the company tweet like: "wow free insults";&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g3G_qxX0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/71y1wlgkknws85vaaf3a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g3G_qxX0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/71y1wlgkknws85vaaf3a.png" alt="Decolar Bot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translated tweet: &lt;em&gt;"Ok, selena gomez is not an artist.. Our team is working to offer your all the possible alternatives."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something very important for the visibility of your brand, profile, account is engagement and to have it you must keep your account always active. You can do this manually or rest with the use of a Twitter bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#twitter-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Twitter API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this API you are able to retrieve, analyze data, write tweets programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twitter API provides the tools you need to contribute to, engage with, and analyze the conversation happening on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start our bot, first of all you need to create (if you don't have one) a twitter account and then you must apply for a developer account to have your user case approved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that you have to create a Twitter Application through &lt;a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new"&gt;Twitter API for developers website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-an-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create an App
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n5QPIt56--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nhshbvmxmza6czxuhvrm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n5QPIt56--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nhshbvmxmza6czxuhvrm.png" alt="Twitter Developer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choose-type-of-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choose type of app
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O8LZsv8D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5xz23atxl29awalmg4tp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O8LZsv8D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5xz23atxl29awalmg4tp.png" alt="Choose Type"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've chose the type hobbyist for the bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lOY-NXj8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n3rissyxhbk3g17b3k2n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lOY-NXj8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n3rissyxhbk3g17b3k2n.png" alt="Making a bot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting started
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit a standard application for access to the Twitter developer plataform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bco-PLlM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bvmpnhie3mzc5go4ml76.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bco-PLlM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bvmpnhie3mzc5go4ml76.png" alt="Standard App"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#describe-your-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Describe your app
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe how you will use Twitter data and/or APIs. For example, you can say: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I will dedicate this bot to test the auto replying to tag and comments, auto retweet and like status with the name of Pelé."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or whatever you like to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bIPziZpD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v7o3kghz557c4oai16yx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bIPziZpD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v7o3kghz557c4oai16yx.png" alt="Describe your App"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#submit-your-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Submit your application
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept the terms and submit your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sAeAvLJu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2w53jbzgep9uulbr1l8d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sAeAvLJu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2w53jbzgep9uulbr1l8d.png" alt="Accept terms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#verify-your-email"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Verify your email
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to verify your email and confirm to complete your application, after that your application will be reviewed. You will have to wait until there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2wBHrvHC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4j1g5e07nixgx9z5fids.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2wBHrvHC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4j1g5e07nixgx9z5fids.png" alt="app-received"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your application is approved you will be provided with a set of credentials that you will use to authenticate all requests to the API. Those are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;API Key&lt;/strong&gt; - This is essentially a username, and allows you to make a request on behalf of your App.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;API Key Secret&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a password, and allows you to make a request on behalf of your App.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Access Token&lt;/strong&gt; - This token represents the Twitter account that owns the App, and allows you to make a request on behalf of that Twitter account. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Access Token Secret&lt;/strong&gt; - This token also represents the Twitter account that owns the App, and allows you to make a request on behalf of that Twitter account. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bearer Token&lt;/strong&gt; - This token represents your App and enables you to authenticate requests that require &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0"&gt;OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token&lt;/a&gt; authentication. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not going to use the Bearer Token on this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Twitter API we will have access to a lot of endpoints and public user's information such as:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweets, Retweets, Likes, Trends, Media&lt;/strong&gt;. As we will also have the right to tweet, retweet, like, send direct messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rate-limit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rate Limit
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter API limits the number of requests a developer can make during a period, so you will have to take this in consideration when writing your bot. If you pass this limit your Twitter bot will be blocked during a time or even stopped to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Twitter API allows you to make &lt;strong&gt;2400 tweet updates&lt;/strong&gt; by day in intervals of 30 minutes in your application (&lt;strong&gt;Retweets are also counted as tweets&lt;/strong&gt;). Also &lt;strong&gt;1000 messages of direct message&lt;/strong&gt;. Follow limit of &lt;strong&gt;400 follows&lt;/strong&gt; by day and etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check all the types of Rate Limit here: &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/rate-limits"&gt;Twitter API rate limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tweepy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tweepy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to use the Python library Tweepy to automatize our twitter bot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API class provides access to the entire twitter RESTful API methods. Each method can accept various parameters and return responses. For more information about these methods please refer to API Reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install Tweepy through the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install tweepy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly I use virtual environment to install my python libraries and packages not globally, if you don't know how to use it go back to the beginning of the last article here: &lt;a href="https://patriciadourado.com/frompat/jwt-login-flask/"&gt;JWT Login Flask&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dotenv"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  dotenv
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To not expose our credentials when eventually pushing to a public repository I recommend the use of the module &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv"&gt;dotenv&lt;/a&gt; and our sensitive data in a .env file like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONSUMER_KEY = 'YOUR API KEY'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'YOUR SECRET KEY'
KEY = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN'
SECRET = 'YOUR SECRET'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install dotenv through pip with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install python-dotenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-tweet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First Tweet!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Import libraries and load env variables&lt;/strong&gt; - First of all we are going to import all the necessary libraries we will use:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tweepy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;load_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Load env variables&lt;/strong&gt; - Then we will load the environment variables from .env file and set the python variables:
load_dotenv()  # take environment variables from .env:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# API key
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'CONSUMER_KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# API secret key
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_SECRET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'CONSUMER_SECRET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Access token
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Access token secret
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SECRET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SECRET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Link credentials to Login&lt;/strong&gt; - Log with the credentials from our Twitter Application with the OAuth. Twitter requires all requests to use OAuth for authentication:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;basicConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweepy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OAuthHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_access_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Create object API&lt;/strong&gt; - We will create a Tweepy API. The API class provides access to the entire twitter RESTful API methods. Each method can accept various parameters and return responses:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweepy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Update status&lt;/strong&gt; - We are going to update our status and tweet our first tweet from the bot!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'bot tweeting live!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#twitter-bot-is-live"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Twitter bot is live!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the code below to tweet our first tweet with bot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-botpy-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;bot.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tweepy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dotenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;load_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;load_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# take environment variables from .env.
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# API key
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'CONSUMER_KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# API secret key
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_SECRET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'CONSUMER_SECRET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Access token
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Access token secret
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SECRET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SECRET'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;basicConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweepy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;OAuthHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CONSUMER_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_access_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Create API object
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweepy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;auth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# First tweet from your bot account!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'bot tweeting live!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#avoid-repeated-tweets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Avoid repeated Tweets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid reply or read the same tweets twice or more we are going to use a file with the ID of the last seen tweets:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'last_seen.txt'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;read_last_seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_read&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'r'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;last_seen_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file_read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;strip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last_seen_id&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;store_last_seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last_seen_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'w'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;last_seen_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#replying-tweets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Replying Tweets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to use the method &lt;code&gt;api.update_status&lt;/code&gt; again, but now for replying to users with the most recents tweets with the word 'Brazil' with the message: &lt;em&gt;"In brazilian portuguese we don't say foreign we say GRINGO and I think that is beautiful!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mentions_timeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_last_seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'extended'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'brazil'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;full_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"@"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;screen_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;" In brazilian portuguese we don't say foreign we say GRINGO and I think that is beautiful!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;store_last_seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To invoke the method just add the following line: &lt;code&gt;reply()&lt;/code&gt; on your python bot.py&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#retweeting-tweets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Retweeting Tweets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we are going to retweet the first 25 tweets mentioning the word &lt;em&gt;brazilian&lt;/em&gt;. Note that I used a &lt;code&gt;time.sleep()&lt;/code&gt; of 900 seconds to run the method &lt;code&gt;api.retweet()&lt;/code&gt; because of the rate limit imposed by Twitter API.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;retweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"brazilian"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'extended'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;retweeted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if Retweet
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;retweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error on retweet"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;retweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A retweet is considered a POST request, that way in 900 seconds (15 minutes) we will retweet 25 tweets, so in one hour (3600 seconds) we will have retweeted 3600/900 = 4 x 25 tweets = 100 tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, observe the rate limit window, per user and app for POST requests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IWWEkhSJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/myq831jdvtl47rbjryjn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IWWEkhSJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/myq831jdvtl47rbjryjn.png" alt="Rate Limit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this logic we will have exactly 300 retweets in 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#liking-tweets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Liking Tweets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To favorite/like the tweets we can use the method &lt;code&gt;api.create_favorite()&lt;/code&gt; like the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_favorite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error on retweet"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;favorite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#replying-and-retweeting-tweets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Replying and Retweeting Tweets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we would like to reply and retweet the same tweet we need to pay attention to not have our bot blocked by spamming, it means if we tweet the same thing in a short period the twitter is going to consider it as a spam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get around this we will add an incremental value of i to differentiate the current reply from the previous one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;retweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"brazilian"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet_mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'extended'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;retweeted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Check if Retweet
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"@"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;screen_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;" In brazilian portuguese we don't say foreign we say GRINGO and I think that is beautiful! +"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;retweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error on retweet"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exc_info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;retweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the number of tweets searched to be replied and retweeted changed to 12 due to the rate limit. If you prefer you can reduce the number of tweets that will be replied and retweeted or increase the time in &lt;code&gt;time.sleep()&lt;/code&gt; for call the method;&lt;/p&gt;

  Thank you!

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed this article and can build your own Twitter bot! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rust + Google Sheets API Quickstart</title>
      <author>Rohan Rajpal</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/rohanrajpal/rust-google-sheets-api-quickstart-7f1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rohanrajpal/rust-google-sheets-api-quickstart-7f1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google sheets API is a very useful tool. For MVPs and prototypes it works amazing, no need for SQL setup and you have a very powerful database frontend (google sheets) to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been learning Rust and wanted to work with Sheets API using Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the sheets documentation has no quickstart of Rust mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this post, you'll learn how to use Sheets API with Rust.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo new sheets_api_rust
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; should look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[package]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"sheets_api_rust"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"0.1.0"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;edition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"2018"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[dependencies]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;google-sheets4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;hyper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^0.14"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;hyper-rustls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^0.22"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;serde&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^1.0"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;serde_json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^1.0"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;yup-oauth2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^5.0"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;tokio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"~1.2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="py"&gt;features&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"macros"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"io-util"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"rt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"rt-multi-thread"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"fs"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and obtain your &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project"&gt;api keys&lt;/a&gt; from google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your &lt;code&gt;credentials.json&lt;/code&gt; should look like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"installed"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"client_id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"384278056379-tr5pbot1mil66749n639jo54i4840u77.apps.googleusercontent.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"project_id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sanguine-rhythm-105020"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"auth_uri"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"token_uri"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"auth_provider_x509_cert_url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"client_secret"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"QeQUnhzsiO4t--ZGmj9muUAu"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"redirect_uris"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"http://localhost"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and finally your &lt;code&gt;main.rs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// This is a modified version of the example at:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;// https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs/tree/main/gen/sheets4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;google_sheets4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sheets4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hyper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hyper_rustls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;yup_oauth2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;oauth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sheets4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sheets4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;#[tokio::main]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// Get an ApplicationSecret instance by some means. It contains the `client_id` and&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// `client_secret`, among other things.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;yup_oauth2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;read_application_secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"clientsecret.json"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;.await&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nf"&gt;.expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"client secret could not be read"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// Instantiate the authenticator. It will choose a suitable authentication flow for you,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// unless you replace  `None` with the desired Flow.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// Provide your own `AuthenticatorDelegate` to adjust the way it operates and get feedback about&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>How to install Figma on Linux</title>
      <author>Anish De</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:08:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/anishde12020/how-to-install-figma-on-linux-127f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/anishde12020/how-to-install-figma-on-linux-127f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt; is a great UI/UX tool with a quite generous free tier. This means many developers use Figma to prototype their application or website designs (including me). Many of us developers tend to use Linux but that is where a problem arises, the Figma app is not available for Linux!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, Figma has a web version which is almost exactly what the desktop version is but the desktop version is still preferred by most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-get-the-figma-app-on-linux"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we get the Figma app on Linux?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, a great developer thought of solving this issue by making an unofficial version of Figma for Linux and the best part is that it is open source. See the GitHub Repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/Figma-Linux/figma-linux"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The app is extremely similar to the Windows version of Figma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-is-the-desktop-app-different-from-the-web-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How is the desktop app different from the web version?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desktop app is built on electron (both, the official version for Windows and macOS as well as the unofficial version for Linux). The main advantages are better font support, in-app tabs (which is extremely useful for me), and extension development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#one-small-problem-which-can-be-fixed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  One Small Problem which can be fixed
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are installing Figma Linux on Ubuntu, you might use the PPA repository way. This way seems to have issues and Figma won't launch. If you ever try to launch it from the terminal, you will see this error -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;figma-linux: error while loading shared libraries: libffmpeg.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what is the fix? &lt;br&gt;
Don't use the PPA!!!&lt;br&gt;
Get the &lt;code&gt;.deb&lt;/code&gt; package from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Figma-Linux/figma-linux/releases"&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you have already downloaded from the PPA, you can simply overwrite it by installing the .deb (It might ask you to downgrade, doing that will also work). We also need to hold it off &lt;code&gt;apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt; or else it will automatically update and cause the issue again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this run the following command -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt-mark hold figma-linux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that is it!!! The issue is fixed and I hope Figma Linux works well for you. If you have any doubts, you can leave down a comment below. For bugs, submit a GitHub issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/Figma-Linux/figma-linux/issues"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
