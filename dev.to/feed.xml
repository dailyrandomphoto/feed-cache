  12 Factor App Blog Post Part 2
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: Make your toy web apps more robust and manageable by following the Twelve-Factor App methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part in a series of posts detailing the &lt;a href="https://12factor.net/"&gt;12 Factor App&lt;/a&gt;. In the last post we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your codebase and made it deployable across different environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependencies and why they’re important in reproducibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration files and how to make them useful across different environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backing services, what they are and how decoupling gives your app more flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a refresher or aren’t familiar with the above already, take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.useanvil.com/blog/engineering/introduction-twelve-factor-app/"&gt;the last post&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the earlier concepts are used as building blocks for the concepts in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#v-build-release-run"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  V. Build, release, run
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly separate build and run stages - &lt;a href="https://12factor.net/build-release-run"&gt;https://12factor.net/build-release-run&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the previous sections finally start coming together here. This may be one of the more time consuming sections or steps, but also the one that will improve your development and release cycles tremendously. These steps are also what people usually refer to as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, or CI/CD. Let’s step through from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the build step, the goal is to get all code and assets into a usable state at the run step. The end product can differ depending on whether you’re building for development or for production. In a development environment, for example, we could skip optimizations such as compressing files and compiling frontend assets (HTML/CSS/JS) into bundles that would normally live in a CDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the build step can look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pin your release on a specific commit or tag, if using git (Factor I). 
This keeps everything at a known starting point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start compiling your code.
This depends on the codebase, but in general, this would be:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather all the app’s dependencies (Factor II) via &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PyPI&lt;/code&gt;, git clones, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile code where needed. This could mean using a bundler like &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt;, or compiling binaries and libraries like Java .jar files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log all build processes running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build process should have a mechanism to keep track of attempted builds -- whether or not they were successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of the above fails to complete, stop the entire build-release-run process and send notifications or some sort of message to the developer about the failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#release"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Release:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the release step, the main product of the release step is to have your compiled and built code ready to run, publish, or use for the end-user in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release process can look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply config specific to this build’s environment (Factor III).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, a development environment can point to a database running on a cheap server instance, while a production version would point to a much more robust version on Amazon RDS with backups enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your tests! This would include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. These tests would run against the compiled build and with the proper config applied. If any tests fail, we could immediately cancel any further actions and send out notifications/messages about the failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other preparations you need before getting to the run phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If using Docker, this is when you would create an image of all the parts of your application that you want deployed. This image is a snapshot of the application code where you know all tests have passed and the build process ran successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, all the previous steps should have given us high confidence that your application will work as expected. We’ve compiled and prepared all code and assets, ensuring that the application is set up correctly and does not have any build-time problems. We’ve tested the application itself with run-time tests, and maybe even end-to-end tests. Now all we have to do is just deploy the thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Run step should be fairly straightforward. We’ll be assuming you’re using Docker, or some other containerization tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload your Docker image(s) from the release step to your code’s final running destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notify/message any other external services that your application is up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If scaling to multiple instances, there are infrastructure considerations that need to be made. You would need a load balancer like &lt;a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.haproxy.org/"&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt;. Some cloud services also handle this automatically like Amazon ECS, so double check with your provider docs as well. At the higher end of complexity, much of this can also be handled with Kubernetes, but that in itself would require more than a few blog posts to introduce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-release-run workflow is very well-supported on platforms like GitHub and GitLab with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD, respectively. You can also customize your own build process with tools like Jenkins and CircleCI. When using those services, the build and release steps are covered, but the run step will require a container hosting service such as Amazon ECS. There are also services that encompass all the steps such as Heroku (which developed this 12 Factor methodology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we actually have a running app. We could stop here, but we have millions of users to take care of and the application needs to scale easily!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vi-processes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  VI. Processes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execute the app as one or more stateless processes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is mainly how to think about your application processes in the context of scaling. At its simplest case, we can think of a single-purpose application that resizes images. This application would get image data, resize it, and finally upload it to a cloud storage service like Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this application, we have no shared state from other processes. We can even imagine 10s or 100s of instances of these running independently in parallel. They all don’t require any additional context data nor do they need to share data. They only need an input (image data) and they return an output (successful upload to S3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the key aspect to processes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processes are stateless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, they don't expect data in memory or on disk will exist permanently. The easiest way to think about this is to ask: If the app were to be completely torn down and redeployed from a Docker image, would it be a catastrophic failure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a twelve-factor app, all the states that we need to persist (database, cloud storage, session data, etc.) are saved in backing services (Factor IV) that our app uses. These backing services are defined in our app’s config (Factor III) which has been applied in the release step of our build-release-run process (Factor V). The app itself should be highly recoverable if it goes down, and at the opposite end, the app should easily scale up to more instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This architecture will play a key role in a few of the next sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#to-be-continued"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  To be continued
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covered sections V-VI of the Twelve-Factor App methodology. Hopefully, this has shown the interconnectedness of all the factors and how smaller efforts in your application architecture can build up to something that can scale and have more resilience.&lt;br&gt;
Here at Anvil we follow many of these concepts in our development process and we believe that sharing our experiences helps everyone create awesome products. If you’re developing something cool with PDFs or paperwork automation, let us know at &lt;a href="mailto:developers@useanvil.com"&gt;developers@useanvil.com&lt;/a&gt;. We’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bulletproof Express - Enterprise-Level Express.js</title>
      <author>João Victor Cardoso Kdouk</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 20:48:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jvkdouk/bulletproof-express-enterprise-level-expressjs-2gig</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jvkdouk/bulletproof-express-enterprise-level-expressjs-2gig</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/JVKdouk/bulletproof-express/"&gt;Click Here to Access It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I am not the only who has read tens of express guides and never really found the perfect way of implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I am confident to say that every Node.js developer has read at least 5 to 6 different guides on writing Express applications. How to make it work is not really a problem nowadays. However, have you ever asked yourself what is the &lt;strong&gt;right way&lt;/strong&gt; to do it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I decided to create a boilerplate that would summarize all the best practices used nowadays in the software industry, ensuring reliability, maintainability and scalability. This is what Bulletproof Express tries to accomplish. These are the features currently provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Security (HTTP Parameter Pollution, Fingerprint, XSS...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Support to Prisma DB (Easily Swappable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Error Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Logging (Using Sentry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Component Structure (Features)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Queries and Mutators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Testing (Using Jest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Multi-Auth Support (JWT Implemented)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Cookie Parsing Supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Environment Variable Parsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Node.js Best Practices Compliant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fully Asynchronous Controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Seeding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Testing via Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Auto-Documentation (Swagger?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mvc-into-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  MVC into Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This boilerplate implements a slightly modified version of Model-View-Controller Pattern. Instead of having a single file storing every endpoint of a controller, every controller is broken down into Queries and Mutators. Inside Queries, you will find operations that retrieve data (usually GET methods). Inside Mutators, you will find operations that change data (usually POST, DELETE, and PUT methods).&lt;br&gt;
Queries and Mutators are joined together inside the controller-specific &lt;code&gt;routes.ts&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn are joined by the upper-level router at &lt;code&gt;/routes/index.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nodejs-best-practices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Node.js Best Practices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repository is compliant with Node.js Best Practices (&lt;a href="https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices"&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt; to access their repository). Security standards are put above any decision. Testing is easy to implement and broken into individual feature, integrating it with the rest of the code as it should be. If you feel like there is any violation of those best practices, feel free to open an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#special-thanks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Special Thanks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to the Spectrum Project (&lt;a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;) for laying the foundations to Bulletproof Express. Also, many thanks to Node.js Best Practices (&lt;a href="https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;) and Bulletproof React (&lt;a href="https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;) for providing guidance on how Enterprise-Level Software should be written.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Acra. Features: Data masking</title>
      <author>Cossack Labs</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 20:47:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cossacklabs/acra-features-data-masking-3ng7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cossacklabs/acra-features-data-masking-3ng7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/"&gt;Cossack Labs&lt;/a&gt;, we strive to go ahead of trends and blaze a most effective trail for our customers. So, we designed Acra as a powerful multi-layer security tool for fintech, neobanks, healthcare and critical industry companies to cover data security threats in one shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra"&gt;Use Acra Community Edition for free&lt;/a&gt;. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/acra/#pricing"&gt;Acra Enterprise Edition&lt;/a&gt; tailored for solutions with high security requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-masking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3️⃣ Data masking
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acra allows configuring &lt;a href="https://docs.cossacklabs.com/acra/security-controls/masking/"&gt;data masking&lt;/a&gt; to certain database fields. Data fields stay encrypted in the database, but look masked/anonymized when reading through Acra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Data masking is useful &lt;strong&gt;whether anonymizing datasets for reporting or exchanging the data with untrusted third parties.&lt;/strong&gt; Acra supports full or partial data masking, allowing customization of mask format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9qx1QWAw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f1pk8fvs4u2i00fa8j1a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9qx1QWAw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f1pk8fvs4u2i00fa8j1a.png" alt="Data masking. Acra by Cossack Labs" width="822" height="290"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with data masking, &lt;strong&gt;data stays encrypted, but could be easily shared&lt;/strong&gt; with untrusted parties without revealing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔥 Let’s explore that else you get in the same box with Acra database security suite, follow the series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tackling Technical Debt: Founding OutSystems</title>
      <author>Conor Bronsdon</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 20:29:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/tackling-technical-debt-founding-outsystems-1k5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/tackling-technical-debt-founding-outsystems-1k5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently on the Dev Interrupted Podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.outsystems.com/"&gt;OutSystems&lt;/a&gt; CEO and founder Paulo Rosado joined us to chat about his path to founding the company, advice for successful leaders, and the growing threat of technical debt for businesses around the world. The conversation below has been edited and summarized for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tell-us-about-outsystems-founding-story-what-inspired-you-to-start-the-company"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tell us about OutSystems' founding story. What inspired you to start the company?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2021, OutSystems was valued at $9.5 billion dollars - but it certainly didn’t start out that way. The idea behind OutSystems was decades in the making, and its mission stems from what I observed after moving to Silicon Valley back in the mid-nineties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey in technology began when I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal and moved to the US to get my Masters in Computer Science from Stanford. Afterward, while working in Silicon Valley, I began to understand just how much of a problem technical debt was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on a very large engineering team, we were faced with tackling a gigantic project in Java and I realized the issues of releasing and maintaining code sustainably. The lack of productivity in the software development process was appalling. Fixing this problem is ultimately what motivated me to found OutSystems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before founding OutSystems, there was a small company I founded and later sold, which focused on internet and intranet projects. It wasn’t a bad company, but we kept failing. Projects were never delivered on time or on budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would think to ourselves, “We’re smart. How is this possible?” Our inclination was to blame the requirements of the project, labeling the scope as incorrect and adjust from there. However, we began to realize that the companies hiring us for these projects wanted us to make changes as we were developing in response to rapidly changing environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue we began to face was the continual accumulation of technical debt. We would reach first production and realize we had built something users didn’t want, requiring us to go back and rework the stuff we had just built. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We came up with this realization that the problem was not that the requirements up front were wrong. The problem was that the cost of changing wrong requirements, which are a fact of life, is very high.” - &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/outsystems-the-journey-to-a-9-5b-valuation/"&gt;on the Dev Interrupted podcast at 6:03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="232px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/1Upd99Drq75d6WQK62e73X"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon was occurring in 90% of projects at the time. Things were always over budget and always late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s easy to take this for granted because concepts like Agile, DevOps, CI/CD are mainstream. But at the time, you had to build software the same way you build a bridge.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-technical-debt-a-challenge-for-companies-now-how-has-this-problem-changed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is technical debt a challenge for companies now? How has this problem changed?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical debt has become a large problem for businesses, and one that only compounds with time. Tech debt doesn’t have a singular cause - it’s the accumulation of several factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my career, I’ve seen first-hand the complexity brought about by the evolution of software development. For instance, we’ve seen an explosion of languages, paradigms and frameworks that can all be used to achieve a solution. Often these languages are dispersed with no connections between them, so tracking these dependencies requires a great deal of sophistication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, turnover within the development team is a critical problem that leads to technical debt. The moment a company loses a developer, the knowledge accrued by that developer also departs the company. The hole left behind is complex, including code,  frameworks and intent behind how their systems are structured. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been my experience that a lost team member can take as much as 20% to 30% of the fundamental knowledge of a system with them. Reverse engineering their work is both time-intensive and inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies have tried to corral this problem by investing in coding standards. While these constraints can help mitigate the loss of a valued developer, our research indicates turnover remains a significant problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7Pcsmt-KBQ"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#outsystems-recently-released-a-study-on-the-effects-of-technical-debt-what-were-its-findings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OutSystems recently released a study on the effects of technical debt. What were its findings?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, OutSystems &lt;a href="https://www.outsystems.com/stop-tech-debt/"&gt;surveyed 500 large companies around the world&lt;/a&gt; to examine the cost of technical debt facing businesses and uncover the challenges companies face as they confront its causes. The results from the companies surveyed were many of the same things I’ve observed throughout my career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that while the causes of technical debt have largely remained the same, the pace at which technical debt occurs has grown substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so it's a hack, right? What we call a hack at OutSystems, they did a hack to just release the software quickly. And those hacks compound into technical debt.” - &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/outsystems-the-journey-to-a-9-5b-valuation/"&gt;on the Dev Interrupted podcast at 27:11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey we conducted isolated three major causes of technical debt. They are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The amount of developer frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; An increase in frameworks leads to an increase in technical debt. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer erosion.&lt;/strong&gt; Employees leaving an organization and taking legacy knowledge with them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Compromises in quality of architecture and code.&lt;/strong&gt; Often caused by a shortsighted view that what needs to be done now is more important than long-term stability of the codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, companies believed they could buy their way out of this problem, but that strategy has proven ineffective. The reality is, the most successful companies must build the software they require to meet their business needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply purchasing what you need doesn’t solve your problems because even purchased systems must be cobbled together, requiring unique API’s, unique UI’s, unique portals, and unique mobile applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2hZnWvqTPk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#does-outsystems-play-a-role-in-helping-companies-cut-tech-debt"&gt;

  Does OutSystems play a role in helping companies cut tech debt?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of what we do at OutSystems is focused on tackling those three fundamental problems. We understand that technical debt amasses slowly over time, through a myriad of decisions that appear much smaller at their onset than their totality would suggest. Once these “tiny” decisions become a major problem, they inhibit investment in current operations and future innovations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing pressures of today’s fast-paced business environment often push companies toward decisions that spiral into technical debt. The good news is that by creating a development process that marries short-term deadlines with long-term strategic goals, it’s possible to “pay down” that debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that any company is capable of whittling away technical debt with the correct tools and processes, and I founded OutSystems because companies shouldn’t have to choose between building fast and building right. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building reusable design system components is a great way for an engineering team to accelerate delivery, improve communication between designers and engineers, and provide a consistent experience for end-users. When your components act in service of a design system, which in turn acts in service of your product’s UX patterns, a cohesive product can be built even as the number of contributors to the product grows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the product evolves and grows, new use cases will emerge that simply don’t exist right now. Your design team will inevitably identify opportunities to extend, enhance, and otherwise evolve the user experience, and so too must the component library evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a component library, this constant change becomes challenging. A single component can be used across multiple products thus any change to that component can potentially result in regression in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with all this in mind, how might we build components that are opinionated enough to drive cohesion in the product, yet flexible enough to adopt future changes without introducing breaking changes and regression?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we look at the &lt;a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks"&gt;Compound Components pattern&lt;/a&gt; as one of the patterns for solving this problem. We will show how &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"&gt;Separation of Concerns&lt;/a&gt; and the Compound Components pattern can help us build a firm, flexible, and resilient component library.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Saga of Developing a List Component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to demonstrate the Compound Component pattern and the problem that it solves using a contrived example of building a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component. We will use React and TypeScript for building this example. Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-attempt-to-build-a-list-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial Attempt to Build a List Component
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our designer, Destin, and our Engineer, Enna are working together to build a component library. They have realized that there is a need for a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component that can be used in different parts of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destin (the designer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey, we need to add a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component to our component library. It's nothing fancy! We just need a list of items like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ya233ku2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/llq732myojqd610mgrii.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ya233ku2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/llq732myojqd610mgrii.jpg" alt="Initial List Component" width="880" height="556"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initial List Component
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enna (the engineer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: It looks simple. I'm on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enna considers that the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component should be opinionated about how the items are rendered to ensure consistency across the product. She decides to make the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component responsible for rendering the items. In her vision, the items are sent to the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; as a prop and the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; takes care of rendering them. She starts building the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component with an interface like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a bit of coding, she builds the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component that can be used like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;item 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description for item 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;item 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description for item 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;item 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description for item 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It looks elegant, easy to use, and ensures that wherever it's used, the items get rendered exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks pass and Destin comes back with a new request. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destin:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Our research has shown that having an icon beside the list items will help people to distinguish between the items more easily. Can we make this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Blddm5L5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0uyitw9lfktug1c0exu.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Blddm5L5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h0uyitw9lfktug1c0exu.jpg" alt="List Component with Icons" width="880" height="556"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;List Component with Icons
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enna:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It should be straightforward. I can 💯% make that happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looks at the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component and decides to add an icon property to each item:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IconName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new change now requires all the instances of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; to receive an icon for each item. But that's not a big deal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;icon1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;item 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description for item 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;icon2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;item 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description for item 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;icon3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;item 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description for item 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component is now in the wild and people are happily using it. But Destin is thinking of new use cases for the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey, we have realized two new use cases for the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component. There are some lists that we would like to have an action button for each item. In some other lists, we would like to have some extra details text in place of the button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NfZCZl6y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdbmawb2075mdnztcqem.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NfZCZl6y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cdbmawb2075mdnztcqem.jpg" alt="List Component with Action Buttons" width="880" height="556"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;List Component with Action Buttons
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rnUVRVMC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z7dvbf38c5st417gvodg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rnUVRVMC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z7dvbf38c5st417gvodg.jpg" alt="List Component with Extra Details" width="880" height="556"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;List Component with Extra Details
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Interesting... this is going to make the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component complex but let me see what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enna realizes that now she has two different types of list items. Some of the properties are shared between the two types (like the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;) and some are unique to each item type. She decides to extract the shared properties into a new interface named &lt;code&gt;ListItemBase&lt;/code&gt; and define &lt;code&gt;ActionListItem&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ExtraDetailListItem&lt;/code&gt; that extend the &lt;code&gt;ListItemBase&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItemBase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IconName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ActionListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BaseListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ListItemWithAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HTMLButtonElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ExtraDetailListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BaseListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ListItemWithExtraDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;extraDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;ListProps&lt;/code&gt; now have a new type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ActionListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ExtraDetailListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interface looks okay-ish but now there should be a decision statement inside the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component that decides whether to render an &lt;code&gt;ActionListItem&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ExtraDetailListItem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She decides that a single decision statement is not a big deal and she goes on with changing the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component to support the two new types of list items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day when Destin is working on designing a feature for communications, he realizes that the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component can be used for rendering a list of messages. He presents the new use case to Enna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: In this new use case we want to show an avatar instead of the icon. We also want to open the conversation when people click on the message item. I forgot to mention that we need to have a way to indicate if the message is unread. Can you make the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component handle this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W5Dul4aW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0bk8oty99g5xz2b3t0fz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W5Dul4aW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0bk8oty99g5xz2b3t0fz.jpg" alt="List component for Conversation List" width="880" height="556"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;List component for Conversation List
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Hmmm... we can change the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component to handle this use case but it will add a lot of complexity to the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are going to be more and more use cases for new types of list items. Adding those use cases to the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; ensures there's a unified way of rendering items which will provide the consistency we would like to have across our products. But with every single change to the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;, we increase the chance of regression for all instances of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;. No need to mention that we are also adding more and more complexity to the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; which makes its maintenance harder. So what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-did-we-end-up-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How did we end up here?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with the initial &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component. In the initial version, the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component had two separate responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rendering a list of items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing how each item should be rendered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rendering a list of items is the actual responsibility of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component, but how each item gets rendered could have been extracted into its own set of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#separation-of-concerns-using-compound-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Separation of Concerns Using Compound Components
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separation of concerns is here to help. By separating every concern of our component into its own component, we can reduce the complexity and make it easier to embrace future changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we figure out different concerns of the component? One easy way to think about concerns is to think about the reasons that each piece of software has for changing. Huh...? Let me explain more. Imagine the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component. The list items can change depending on the feature we are building and the customer's needs. The requirement for the list itself would not generally change from feature to feature. So the list and list items have different reasons for changing. This means they are different concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we figured out the two concerns of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component, how can we separate them? &lt;a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks"&gt;Compound Components&lt;/a&gt; are the way to accomplish this. The &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component can accept its items as children like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{...{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some immediate advantages to this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complexity is broken down into smaller components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in the &lt;code&gt;ListItem&lt;/code&gt; would not alter the code in the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component. This helps with less regression over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get back to the earlier request we had about rendering a list of Messages. Our first instinct might be to modify our &lt;code&gt;ListItem&lt;/code&gt; to be able to handle messages. But wait! Do message items have different reasons for changing than the generic &lt;code&gt;ListItem&lt;/code&gt;? Yes! They are representing two different types of information that can have different reasons for change. Hence our message item is a new concern. We can create a new component for the &lt;code&gt;MessageItem&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MessageItem&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thumbnail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;thumbnail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sentAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sentAt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasBeenRead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasBeenRead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can extend the usage of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component to a variety of use cases without touching anything in the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component concerns using the Compound Component pattern helps embracing future changes more easily without causing regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we separated the concerns of the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component into smaller components that can be passed as children for the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;. This made the component less complex, easier to maintain, and flexible to future changes. But now we created a new problem! Any component can be passed as children to the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; and we lost control over which types of items we render in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since any component can be passed as children to the new &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component, this might feel like we can't enforce the design system's opinions on the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component. In order to enforce those opinions, we can check the type of each child and ensure they are aligned with the opinion of our design system. Depending on how strict you want to be, you can show a warning message or even not render the items that are not accepted by the design system:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ACCEPTED_LIST_ITEMS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MessageListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ACCEPTED_LIST_ITEMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;The List can't render this type of item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;🎉 with this final touch we ensured that the &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; component is firm in allowing only certain types of items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is an inevitable part of any software and UI components are no different. When building UI components, it’s helpful to ask yourself about the possible future changes that the component could expect. This will help you understand different reasons that your component could change and will provide a good way to separate those concerns. The goal is not to build a component that covers all the expected/unexpected future needs, but rather to separate the concerns in a way that future changes can be applied with minimal impact on the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Compound Component pattern can be used to break down the concerns of a component into smaller components. This will help reduce the complexity and also decrease the chance of regression as we add new capabilities to the component. It also enables your design team to iterate and expand on the design system with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building an Express back-end for basic CRUD operations</title>
      <author>Dubymar Tollinchi</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 20:14:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dubymarjtr/building-an-express-back-end-for-basic-crud-operations-4m0n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dubymarjtr/building-an-express-back-end-for-basic-crud-operations-4m0n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When enrolling for college, I had to choose between Web Development and Web Design. This decision was quite easy because I thought "making a website look pretty is something that most developers can do (not saying it's easy tho!), but making a website be completely functional? That's more of a complex job, and that's a challenge I want to take". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my Web Technologies class, after learning the basics of JavaScript and working with front-end, it was time to swim into the deep waters of the back-end of a website. I was assigned to create RESTful routes that interact with a MongoDB database using Node.js and Express.js. It was very confusing at the beginning, but after building a few small projects applying the same steps, I feel more comfortable to share the knowledge I acquired with this community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's dive into it!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to know about is Node.js, and I already wrote a &lt;a href="https://dev.to/dubymarjtr/understanding-node-js-5n8"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about it, so go check that out so you understand why and how it is used. After installing Node, we will use the terminal to install the required dependencies, in this case are: &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mongodb&lt;/code&gt;. Luckily, I used a template that already had all these installed, but if your project does not have any of these, just type &lt;code&gt;npm install express&lt;/code&gt; on the terminal, repeating the same syntax with the other packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is to create a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file, which will contain the database URL that will connect our application to MongoDB. This file will be untracked, since we do not want to include it in our commits. This is more of a security reason, because why will we want strangers accessing to our database, right?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DB_CLIENT_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;databaseurl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third step is to go into our config.js file and declare the configurations for our project. In this case, I have the port, database URL, name, and collection name. Having this information here and not in other files will make our website easier to maintain, having to change it just here and not everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;clientURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;DB_CLIENT_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sample_airbnb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;listingsAndReviews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can notice, there is no way to see the actual database URL. For this project I used an Airbnb database sample from MongoDB, but in case I want to use another database, I can change the name and collection right there and that will be applied to the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth step is to create a db/conns (database connections) folder, and inside create a client.js file, that will contain a reusable Mongo client to connect to our application. Here is where we use that &lt;code&gt;mongodb&lt;/code&gt; package that we installed earlier. &lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: this is the only file inside of that folder, everything else from now on will continue to exist inside the server folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MongoClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mongodb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./config.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MongoClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;MongoDB Client 🏃🏾‍♂️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Error starting MongoDB Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Exit process with failure&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;SIGINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;MongoDB Client disconnected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once we have our Mongo Client successfully connecting to our database, we can proceed to create our routes in the router.js file. First, we will start with a test route to connect to our API. We need to import the content from config.js, client.js, and our &lt;code&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./config.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./db/conns/client.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create collection variable to reduce code duplication&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// localhost:3000/api&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello from API router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To utilize this router we need to import it to our index.js file, using express as the framework that will make our lives easier. Express gives developers all the tools they need to create HTTP servers, allowing to receive and send data as JSON.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./config.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./router.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// json middleware allows to send and receive JSON data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To run our server we can type &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; in our terminal, and then go to any explorer and type &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/api"&gt;http://localhost:3000/api&lt;/a&gt; and that will show "Hello from API router". Now that our testing route is working, we can proceed to create the rest of our routes. In this project we are using basic CRUD operations, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first route will allow to read all listings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// get all listings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/listings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listingsData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listingsData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second one will take a listing id and delete that listing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// delete a listing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/listings/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;deletedListing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deleteOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deletedListing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third one will take a listing id and update that listing. To test this route, we will need &lt;a href="https://insomnia.rest/"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, having in mind that we are not sending any JSON on the browser, just receiving. In the Insomnia body we can send the "payload", which is the updated data for our listing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// update a listing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/listings/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updatedListing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updatedListing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the fourth one to complete our CRUD operations is deleting a listing using its id.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// delete a listing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/listings/:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;deletedListing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deleteOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deletedListing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This project has more routes, such as reading an specific listing, getting all reviews from one listing, creating, updating and deleting a review from one listing. For your reference, this is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dubymarjtr/airbnb-project"&gt;project repo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These basic routes allow us to perform CRUD operations in our database, and although it is just a server-side project, this gives you an idea on how to create a full-stack website, if you already know how to connect to the client-side. Node.js and Express.js made possible to create and work with the server without knowing any other server-side language, such as PHP. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Felte: An extensible form library for Solid</title>
      <author>Pablo Berganza</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:51:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pabloabc/felte-an-extensible-form-library-for-solid-4cde</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pabloabc/felte-an-extensible-form-library-for-solid-4cde</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arguably one of the most common problems front-end developers need to solve is form handling. Specially in modern web applications that require instant validation and other real-time interactions with the user.  To provide the best user experience as possible, you’ll probably grab a third party form management library to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I am going to write about Felte, a form management library for Solid I have been working on for the past year that aims to make the basics of form handling on the front-end as simple as possible, while still allowing for it to grow more complex as your requirements grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of two blog posts I’m writing. This one is oriented towards Felte’s integration with &lt;a href="https://solidjs.com"&gt;Solid&lt;/a&gt;. The other one is oriented towards Felte’s integration with &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev"&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Felte aims to make the basics of form reactivity as easy to handle as possible, while still allowing for more complex behaviours via configuration and extensibility. Its main features are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single action to make your form reactive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use HTML5 native elements to create your form. (Only the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute is necessary).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides stores and helper functions to handle more complex use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No assumptions on your validation strategy. Use any validation library you want or write your own strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handles addition and removal of form controls during runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official solutions for error reporting using &lt;code&gt;reporter&lt;/code&gt; packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports validation with &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/validators#using-yup"&gt;yup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/validators#using-zod"&gt;zod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/validators#using-superstruct"&gt;superstruct&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/validators#using-vest"&gt;vest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/extending-felte"&gt;extend its functionality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-look-like"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it look like?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its most basic form, Felte only requires a single function to be imported:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@felte/solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;onSubmit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sign in"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We set up the form by calling &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt; with our &lt;code&gt;submit&lt;/code&gt; handler. This function returns, among other utilities, an action that can be used on your form element. Now Felte will track all inputs with a &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; attribute. When submitting your form, the latest values in your inputs will be passed to your &lt;code&gt;onSubmit&lt;/code&gt; function as an object. For our previous example, the shape of &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; will be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  email: '',
  password: '',
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-can-i-see-my-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where can I see my data?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you type, Felte will keep track of your user’s input in a regular Solid store. This store is returned by &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;, following the same shape as the values you’d receive on your &lt;code&gt;onSubmit&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this would log your user’s email to the console as they type it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-might-need-some-validation-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I might need some validation here
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, another common requirement of forms is validation. If we want our app to feel snappy to the user, we will want some client side validation. &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt;’s configuration object accepts a &lt;code&gt;validate&lt;/code&gt; function (which can be asynchronous). It will receive the current value of your &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; store as it changes, and it expects you to return an object with the same shape as your &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; store containing your validation messages if the form is not valid, or nothing if your form is valid. Felte will keep track of these validation messages on a store that is returned from &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;errors&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentErrors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Must not be empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Must not be empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More complex validation requirements might require third party validation libraries. Felte offers first party integrations  with some popular validation libraries through its extensibility features. These integrations are offered as separate packages. I will write write more about this in the next section regarding extensibility, but you can read more about these packages in our &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/validators"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#handling-complex-scenarios-via-extensibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Handling complex scenarios via extensibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felte does not attempt to have the perfect solution on how to handle all scenarios regarding form management. This is why Felte offers an API to extend its functionality as your requirements grow more complex. You may have a preferred library you like to use, such as the really popular &lt;a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup"&gt;yup&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://vestjs.dev/"&gt;Vest&lt;/a&gt; (which was recently talked about during &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2PuiawaGV4"&gt;Svelte Summit&lt;/a&gt;). Modifying Felte’s behaviour to handle these scenarios can be done via the &lt;code&gt;extend&lt;/code&gt; option on &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt;’s configuration object. More about this can be read in the &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/extending-felte"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt;. To keep things simple for the purposes of this blog post, I am only going to write about some of the existing packages we maintain to handle some common use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently maintaining four packages to integrate Felte with some popular validation libraries: &lt;code&gt;yup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zod&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;superstruct&lt;/code&gt; and most recently &lt;code&gt;vest&lt;/code&gt;. Here we will use yup as an example, but you can read more about the rest &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/validators"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package to use &lt;code&gt;yup&lt;/code&gt; is on npm under the name &lt;code&gt;@felte/validator-yup&lt;/code&gt;. You will need to install it alongside &lt;code&gt;yup&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; @felte/validator-yup yup

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Or, if you use yarn&lt;/span&gt;

yarn add @felte/validator-yup yup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This validator package exports a function called &lt;code&gt;validator&lt;/code&gt; which can be passed as-is to the &lt;code&gt;extend&lt;/code&gt; option of &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt;. Your validation schema can then be passed to the &lt;code&gt;validateSchema&lt;/code&gt; option:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@felte/validator-yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OR `extend: [validator],`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;validateSchema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;schema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reporters-displaying-validation-messages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reporters: Displaying validation messages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Displaying your validation messages can be done by directly accessing the &lt;code&gt;errors&lt;/code&gt; store returned by &lt;code&gt;createForm&lt;/code&gt;. Messages won’t be available on this store until the related field is interacted with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;solid-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@felte/solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Email:&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Submit&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But displaying the messages is not the end of the story in most cases. For example, you might want to add an &lt;code&gt;aria-invalid&lt;/code&gt; attribute to the related input. Or you simply might not like that specific syntax to handle your validation messages. Felte currently has four accompanying packages that offer different alternatives on how to display your validation messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a Solid component, which gives the most flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modifying the DOM directly by adding and removing DOM elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Tippy.js to display your messages  in a tooltip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the browser’s built-in constraint validation API, which can be less friendly to mobile users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For brevity, I am only going to cover the first package. But you can read more about the rest &lt;a href="https://felte.dev/docs/solid/reporters"&gt;in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a Solid component to get your validation messages can be done with the package &lt;code&gt;@felte/reporter-solid&lt;/code&gt;.  You’ll need to add it to your project using your favourite package manager:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# npm&lt;/span&gt;
npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-S&lt;/span&gt; @felte/reporter-solid

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# yarn&lt;/span&gt;
yarn add @felte/reporter-solid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then you’ll need to import both the &lt;code&gt;reporter&lt;/code&gt; function to add to the &lt;code&gt;extend&lt;/code&gt; property, and the &lt;code&gt;ValidationMessage&lt;/code&gt; component which you will use to receive your validation messages:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@felte/reporter-solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@felte/solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// or [reporter]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We assume a single string will be passed as a validation message&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This can be an array of strings depending on your validation strategy&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"password"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidationMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sign in"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#next-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check more about Felte in its &lt;a href="https://felte.dev"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; with some functional examples. There’s also a more complex example showcasing its usage with Tippy.js and Yup available on &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/felte-demo-solidjs-w92uj?file=/src/main.tsx"&gt;CodeSandbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finishing thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this served as a good introduction to Felte, and that it is interesting enough for you to give it a try. Felte is currently in quite a useable state and I feel it’s flexible enough for most use cases.  I am also open to help and suggestions so feel free to open an issue or make a pull request on &lt;a href="https://github.com/pablo-abc/felte"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little drops on C# Interview questions - Intermediate Language</title>
      <author>Ynoa Pedro</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:33:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ypedroo/little-drops-on-c-interview-questions-intermediate-language-3hkf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ypedroo/little-drops-on-c-interview-questions-intermediate-language-3hkf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Little drops on C# Interview Questions series&lt;br&gt;
The intention behind this series is to answer with a little bit of context or examples of some of the most common C# interview questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we briefly explain what is Intermediate Language&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-net-c-how-it-works-then"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So .NET != C#? How it works then?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely, I have seen many people getting this mistakenly, .NET is a platform for CLR languages to be compiled(Common runtime language), with this in mind to compile anything we have to think it into 3 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wa8wjzWY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s5hr5qnc4ox3z7xx9ph1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wa8wjzWY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s5hr5qnc4ox3z7xx9ph1.gif" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So IL is the half compiled code that is interpreted by JIT into machine code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-i-need-to-know-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do I need to know it
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are to specialize in something do it right and know how it works, not only for interviews, knowing one or two levels of abstractions besides your favorite language enables you to solve more complex issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-can-i-see-the-il-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok, can I see the IL code?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, the are many great tools to visualize and interact with IL, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy"&gt;ILSpy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linqpad.net/"&gt;LinqPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/"&gt;dotnetfiddle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, IDEs usually have nice integrations, like Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider my personal choice:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dNxn12Xr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/edia559be9g8m8xd9wot.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dNxn12Xr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/edia559be9g8m8xd9wot.png" alt="Image description" width="618" height="511"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#to-go-deeper"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  To go deeper
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course just a brief introduction on the topic, for further reading I recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flame 1.0 is here!</title>
      <author>Luan Nico</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:56:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/blue-fire/flame-10-is-here-430n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/blue-fire/flame-10-is-here-430n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there, folks! It's been a while since our last article, but if you are following &lt;a href="https://github.com/flame-engine/flame"&gt;Flame on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or participating in our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, you know very well that we have not been idle. Far from it. In fact, you might have noticed more and more Release Candidates being put out regularly, mostly with some needed updates and cleanups, a few new core features, bug fixes, and incorporating valuable feedback from our amazing Game Jam. That is because both the team and the community have been working together, relentlessly, to make Flame the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, first of all, I would like to make it very clear that we are not done with this goal, not even close -- the pile of things we know could be improved, extended or added is only shadowed by the mountain that we don't even know about yet. So the first thing I would like to reassure everyone, with this article, is that nothing really changes in that regard. We will still be putting out PRs, receiving invaluable help from the community, making improvements, new features, bug fixes. We will still be at discord, helping out new people, having deep, productive discussions with veterans, and collaborating together to keep growing and enhancing all Blue Fire's projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we do have a key milestone to share. You might have already heard about it on the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/flutter/announcing-flutter-2-8-31d2cb7e19f5"&gt;Flutter 2.8 release article&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe got a sneak peek on pub; but, regardless, we wanted to double down and proudly announce we just released Flame 1.0.0. Yes, it's official, and finally here! What an end-of-year holiday gift to us to finally be able to say that, given all the work that has been put into it! We are very happy with the current state of our code and the capabilities provided, and we think it's time to make this commitment. Thank you so much for every single one of you, that contributed with PRs, discussions, questions (that led us to improve some docs or reconceptualize some API), monetary donations via our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/bluefireoss"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, or that used Flame, made something great, participated in any way, gave us a star on &lt;a href="https://github.com/flame-engine/flame"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or just for reading and sharing this article. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me reiterate; we are still going to keep improving, updating, fixing, enhancing Flame. In fact, I hope version 1.0.0 lives very briefly on pub, to be replaced with 1.0.1, 1.1.0, whichever comes first, very soon. This just means we believe the current API is stable, and we won't be making big, breaking changes that often, or without warning. Expect more structured, stable updates, especially new features. It also means we can focus our attention now to improving our docs, bridge packages, tooling, examples and tutorials to make sure this awesome ecosystem that came about works seamlessly and frictionlessly, and that people can easily welcome people to join and learn. We are also happy to have established and to carry on this partnership with the Flutter team to make sure we all pave a future together for Flame and our beloved community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note, we ask you to update your dependency, head over to &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; to continue the discussion, and if you haven't, please check &lt;a href="https://medium.com/flutter/announcing-flutter-2-8-31d2cb7e19f5"&gt;Flutter's article&lt;/a&gt; about all the amazing things packed on Flutter 2.8, and let us know if you have any feedback! Thanks everyone again for everything, and have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beginning Git and Github </title>
      <author>ADEOYE ADEFEMI OPEOLUWA</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/opeolluwa/beginning-git-and-github-4l3k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we took a quick tour on the subject of git and GitHub. Herein we'll get to the real deal of installing git on our machine 💻. You might wanna power your computer it's show time 😉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-git-for-windows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing git for Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"&gt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the download link for Windows and allow the download to complete &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2IbVqwl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i6w1nf18m3mrhnqspi8j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2IbVqwl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i6w1nf18m3mrhnqspi8j.png" alt="download git" width="800" height="487"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse to the download location (or use the download shortcut in your browser). Double-click the file to extract and launch the installer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VUIQo0Cs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bhvz2yw3fjhob4vujtsx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VUIQo0Cs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bhvz2yw3fjhob4vujtsx.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="231"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceed to install the downloaded package &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2Qm93g1w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsuqlsqth0zqcqgn9z2y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2Qm93g1w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsuqlsqth0zqcqgn9z2y.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="396"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read and accept end user agreement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zIaHFJUO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r0im44itreqgjeybxzc2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zIaHFJUO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r0im44itreqgjeybxzc2.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this the installer Will ask series of questions starting with, &lt;strong&gt;installation location.&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to stick to the default (unless you're feeling adventurous), click next or press &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt; on your keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally you should have &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Kg3fJ8zk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3ylh0i2huyy5fmn7yzl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Kg3fJ8zk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3ylh0i2huyy5fmn7yzl.png" alt="Installing git on windows" width="800" height="435"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all go well, cheers to us! We have just installed git on your machine 🍻&lt;/p&gt;
