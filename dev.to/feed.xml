  &lt;a href="#tired-of-opening-manually-the-same-programs-every-morning-or-every-time-that-you-switch-projects-running-the-same-command-over-and-over"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tired of opening manually the same programs every morning ? Or every time that you switch projects, running the same command over and over?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#well-i-was-in-the-same-place-that-you-so-i-did-a-little-research-and-check-what-other-team-member-were-using-to-start-the-day-faster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Well I was in the same place that you, so I did a little research and check what other team member were using to start the day faster
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My start of the day is kind of repetitive or let say is almost the same when I start the working day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the chat application that i user to communicate with my team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open my time tracker application - so i can have a clear view of where my time is going every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Firefox with a couple tabs that a need for the day

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the ticket system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check my calendar for the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the latest changes that the repo have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution for me was the fallowing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp"&gt;tmuxp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tmux session manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INSTALL STEPS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pip install --user tmuxp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create and &lt;code&gt;yml&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;~/.config/tmuxp/{filename}.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is mine :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;session_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;start_directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;~/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# load session relative to config location (project root).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;echo "Starting of the day"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# shell_command_before:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# - '[ -f .venv/bin/activate ] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; source .venv/bin/activate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; reset'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;windows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;window_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Start the day&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tiled&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;main-pane-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;panes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;shell_command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;firefox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#https://leamsigc.com/ add the link to the tab that firefox sould open&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;shell_command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Open vscode&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;shell_command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Making digital currency; How to create a new cryptocurrency</title>
      <author>ladi ladi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ladiladi123/making-digital-currency-how-to-create-a-new-cryptocurrency-3d98</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many startups have made a lot of money by creating a digital currency and selling tokens in the initial public offering. Creating a new digital currency may seem like an impossible process to most people. While making digital currency is possible if you have enough knowledge in this field. In this article, we will introduce you to the methods of making a digital currency and at the end, we will answer some common questions in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are new digital currencies being created?&lt;br&gt;
Even if virtual money has been available to the public for a long time, Bitcoin is the first known and most successful cryptocurrency in the cryptocurrency market. Many cryptocurrencies have been created today, the most popular of which are Bitcoin, Ripple, and Atrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some unique features make companies and individuals think about creating cryptocurrencies. The most important features of digital currency are cryptography, security and confidentiality, no need to monitor a central institution, transparency of transactions, fast transactions, and ease of transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-difference-between-coins-and-digital-currency-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The difference between coins and digital currency tokens
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people mistakenly use tokens and quins as synonyms. While Token and Quinn are different. The most important thing that distinguishes a token from a quin is the lack of an independent blockchain. Tokens are created on the platform of other blockchains. But Quinn has an independent blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important difference between coins and tokens is that coins are used to buy and sell and are considered a method of payment. While most tokens can be used for use in an application or as an asset. Bitcoin, Atrium, Ripple, and Light Coin are the most popular coins in the digital currency market. Tetra, Chainlink, Dai, and Avi are also in the category of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#digital-currency-making-training-introducing-3-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Digital currency making training; Introducing 3 methods
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-one-create-a-new-digital-currency-by-creating-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method one: Create a new digital currency by creating tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make digital currency is to create tokens. As we have said, a token is a digital currency that does not have its independent blockchain and has been created and launched in the context of another blockchain. For this reason, when a token is generated, there is no need to work on the rules of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making tokens is cost-effective for blockchain developers because they do not need the astronomical cost of designing a blockchain to achieve their goals. Of course, it is also important to note that many digital currencies, when in their infancy, are implemented on another blockchain platform to save costs, but once they have been sufficiently developed, a dedicated blockchain for They are used to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The token can be created on all blockchain platforms that use smart contracts. Atrium is one of the most popular token-building platforms. At the time of writing, Atrium has hosted more than 80% of the tokens on the market. Bainenschin, Ias, Kazmas, Thezos, and Theron are other common platforms for making tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atrium's programming language is solidity. Solidarity uses concepts that exist in other programming languages ​​such as PHP. It is a high-level programming language that has all the capabilities and capabilities needed for blockchain software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-2-create-digital-currency-by-copying-and-modifying-current-blockchains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 2: Create digital currency by copying and modifying current blockchains
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to build digital currency is to use open-source blockchains. Open source blocks are made available to the public with programming code after they are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atrium and Bitcoin programming codes are also open source and can be accessed by anyone on GitHub. Many blockchains have been launched following the example of these two digital currencies. For example, by making a few changes to the Bitcoin blockchain, the LightCoin network is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-3-create-a-digital-currency-by-creating-a-new-blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 3: Create a digital currency by creating a new blockchain
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build digital currency through the new blockchain&lt;br&gt;
Building and designing a blockchain network is another way to create a new digital currency. In a blockchain, data is stored in blocks and forms an interconnected chain. This structure creates an immutable storage system. The blocks are connected using hashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new blockchain requires deep programming knowledge and a lot of time. In the following, the steps of creating a new digital currency through making blockchain are outlined in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the consensus mechanism&lt;br&gt;
Consensus mechanisms are protocols for verifying transactions performed in blockchain without the need for a third party (intermediary). Proof of work and the stock proof is currently the most well-known and basic blockchain consensus mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the blockchain platform&lt;br&gt;
The correct choice of blockchain platform depends on the consensus mechanism you have chosen. The best blockchain operating systems are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum&lt;br&gt;
Waves (WAVES)&lt;br&gt;
Hyperledger Fabric&lt;br&gt;
NEM&lt;br&gt;
IBM blockchain&lt;br&gt;
Nxt (NXT)&lt;br&gt;
HydraChain&lt;br&gt;
BlockStarter&lt;br&gt;
BigChainDB&lt;br&gt;
EOS&lt;br&gt;
Quorum&lt;br&gt;
IOTA&lt;br&gt;
CoinList&lt;br&gt;
MultiChain&lt;br&gt;
Open chain&lt;br&gt;
Chain Core&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design the nodes&lt;br&gt;
You need to decide how the blockchain works and design the nodes accordingly. For example, will the licenses be private or public? Will the hosting be on-premises web systems or cloud systems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specify the blockchain architecture&lt;br&gt;
Before launching a digital currency, you need to be sure of all aspects; Because you can not change multiple blockchain parameters after startup. For example, you need to specify what address blockchain will follow to track exchanges of different cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design the user interface&lt;br&gt;
If your user interface is not good, the cipher project will fail. You need to make sure you are using the latest version of FTP servers, databases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frequently-asked-questions-about-making-new-digital-currencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frequently Asked Questions about Making New Digital Currencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does making a digital currency always lead to profitability?&lt;br&gt;
No. More than a few hundred thousand digital currencies have been launched on various platforms, many of which have failed. For this reason, all aspects of work must be well weighed before creating a digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the reason for the failure of some new digital currencies?&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, this perspective often causes us to become overwhelmed when it's time to start a new digital currency. That's why we see so many teams being forgotten after spending so much money and energy to create a new digital currency, without gaining popularity. One of the main reasons for their failure is that they failed to do good marketing. Therefore, before any action, the marketing system must be well defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the first step in building a new digital currency?&lt;br&gt;
The first step in creating a new digital currency is to have a well-defined digital currency white paper. White paper in the world of digital currencies means a comprehensive and complete report of the problem that the introduced project seeks to solve. Project objectives should be clearly defined within the white paper. A standard and complete white paper include an abstract, introduction, problem definition, product description, technical details, descriptions of the new digital currency, details of the public offering, and introduction of the development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost to create a new digital currency?&lt;br&gt;
Creating new passwords is not an easy task and will probably require some financial resources; Unless you can handle things like development, documentation, and marketing. The cost of building an encrypted currency depends on several factors, and no specific number can be specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concluding-remarks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Concluding remarks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new dedicated currency may seem like an attractive and profitable offer at first, but we must not forget that there are many challenges in this direction. For this reason, sufficient market research must be done before any action is taken. On the other hand, the necessary capital must be provided for manufacturing and marketing. Otherwise, the digital currency project is likely to fail in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content management system plays a vital role in Web development field. The most popular CMS WordPress covers the 40% market share in the web development. There are a-lot of people who don't want to indulge in long term coding process as it's boring for them so they prefer CMS. From mobile responsiveness to attractive site creation, CMS covers all the aspects. &lt;br&gt;
It shows the better idea to beginners that how they play with margins and paddings of the sections and give the idea of the responsiveness. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tacit Knowledge Series</title>
      <author>Matt Thompson</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 08:04:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/matttea/the-tacit-knowledge-series-54gb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/matttea/the-tacit-knowledge-series-54gb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From a personal and professional standpoint I'm interested in what is required to keep engineers moving from being experienced and competent to being expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many views point to &lt;code&gt;tacit knowledge&lt;/code&gt;. But by its very nature tacit knowledge is hard to define and even harder to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shawn Wang describes the problem perfectly in his excellent book &lt;strong&gt;The Coding Career Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of your learning from Junior to Senior involves gaining tacit knowledge. You can read all the programming books in the world, but, by definition, you are still limited to things that people can write down. That is explicit knowledge, and it is only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see tacit knowledge in action every day - when a doctor is able to make a prognosis during a crazy short appointment, or, hopefully more commonly, when an expert engineer looks at a design for all of 5 seconds and can immediately tell you her concerns or questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand how they reached these conclusions so quickly, explanations might start with some principles, then move on to the exceptions and caveats to these principles, and may often ends with something like "&lt;em&gt;it just feels right&lt;/em&gt;". It's these natural judgements that are made that can't be simply explained so that others could reach the exact same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an excellent breakdown of this, with detailed examples in software engineering and other knowledge fields, I highly recommend Cedric Chin's Commonplace article - &lt;a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/"&gt;Tacit Knowledge is a Real Thing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to tap into the tacit knowledge of those around me. I know I can't replace gaining the experience that will build this knowledge myself, but I hope that by being in tune with it I can see the situations, ask the questions, and hopefully understand the thought processes behind these judgements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to pick up on scenarios where experienced engineers might have taken a path through a situation or problem that wasn't obvious to me, pin them down to walk through how they approached it; what experience, principles and ideas they drew on, and then write it down and share it here...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction To Web Sockets</title>
      <author>Hannah</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 08:03:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/earthcomfy/introduction-to-web-sockets-3n7m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/earthcomfy/introduction-to-web-sockets-3n7m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys, so I was thinking of using Django to add a web socket support to a project am working on then I came across &lt;a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;django channels&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a project that can support the web socket protocol. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before showing you guys how we can use Django Channels to create real-time applications that go beyond the standard HTTP protocol, I thought about giving a conceptual introduction about web sockets together with an explanation about the &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--erotv3wA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzq0d9ojl8b6up4686qs.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--erotv3wA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzq0d9ojl8b6up4686qs.gif" alt="Moving On..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In a real-time application, there is a continuous exchange of information between the client and the server. The HTTP protocol can't fulfill the needs of these applications because after the initial request is complete, the server-client communication is closed and to get an update, the client has to establish the connection again. This is where web sockets come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing demand for real-time applications can be achieved with web sockets, a dual-channel full duplex bidirectional protocol which maintains a persistent, open connection between client and server. Don't worry I know it's a mouthful of words, so let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dual-channel full-duplex bidirectional communication&lt;/em&gt; simply means that the client and the server can talk in real-time without having to continuously make requests, and contrary to HTTP where request is always initiated by the client, and response is processed by the server, with web sockets the communication can go either way i.e. from server to client or client to server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#main-characteristics-of-web-socket"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Main characteristics of web socket:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an HTTP upgrade. The following occurs in a web socket connection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First is what we call &lt;strong&gt;The Client Handshake Request&lt;/strong&gt; which means that the client sends a standard HTTP request with headers to the server for an upgrade from HTTP to web sockets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second is &lt;strong&gt;The Web Socket Handshake&lt;/strong&gt;. Here the server listens for incoming socket connections using that same TCP connection that is originally established by HTTP. The handshake is the bridge from HTTP to web sockets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third is &lt;strong&gt;The Server Handshake Response&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, if all the terms are met, the server agrees to upgrade and sends back a response indicating that the protocol will be changed to web socket. The server also maintains the originally established TCP connection throughout the lifecycle of the web socket connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Notice&lt;/strong&gt; that headers are sent only once, and that is during the upgrade request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, using the concept of web sockets we can build projects that require ongoing updates, and fast reaction time. As an example consider a chat application that allows multiple users to chat in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Web Sockets are used, users can exchange messages in real-time. For instance, someone sends a message to a group chat then the server gets that message and will send it to everyone in that same connection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#websocket-client-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  WebSocket client application
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebSocket client applications use the &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; API to communicate with WebSocket servers using the WebSocket protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; API makes it possible for a two-way interactive communication between the client and the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To open a web socket connection, we first need to make an object of &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; API which will then be used to send and receive data on the established connection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;WebSocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alright, after the socket instance is created we can use different event listeners to perform certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebSocket event handlers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;socket.open()&lt;/code&gt; - Called when a connection is established.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;socket.onmessage()&lt;/code&gt; - Called when a message is received from the server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;socket.onclose()&lt;/code&gt; - Called when the connection is closed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;socket.error()&lt;/code&gt; - Called when an error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebSocket Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;socket.send()&lt;/code&gt; - Sends data to the server using the established connection. We can format the data as JSON to be sent over to the server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;socket.close()&lt;/code&gt; - Terminates the connection.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#websocket-server-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  WebSocket server application
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A WebSocket server is an application listening on any port of a TCP server that follows a specific protocol. As I mentioned in the beginning of this tutorial, we can utilize Django Channels to build real time apps that support web sockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an upcoming tutorial, we will see in detail how all this works together, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>These 2 GitHub Tools Left Me Awestruck (Really, No Exaggeration) </title>
      <author>Mohmed Ishak</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ishakmohmed/these-2-github-tools-left-me-awestruck-really-no-exaggeration-3ag9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, devs! GitHub is cool but it can be better. This is a super short article because honestly, no one likes to read a long one, so I better get right to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-install-a-code-tree-extension"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  [1] Install A Code Tree Extension
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install Octotree Chrome extension from Chrome Web Store (&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree-github-code-tree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc"&gt;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree-github-code-tree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc&lt;/a&gt;). Using this tool, you'll have a code tree pinned to the left of your screen whenever you check out any repo. With this, you'll always have a quick overview of the folder structure of any repo regardless of which exact file you're currently looking at. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without Octotree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gv6Ui7FD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eaz0tkdt5e18j02up3qg.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gv6Ui7FD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eaz0tkdt5e18j02up3qg.PNG" alt="Mohmed Ishak"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Octotree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XuVDhNK3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rsl4cbmb4fy8a2e8itvv.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XuVDhNK3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rsl4cbmb4fy8a2e8itvv.PNG" alt="Mohmed Ishak"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-write-cool-readmes-effortlessly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  [2] Write Cool READMEs Effortlessly
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this site (&lt;a href="https://readme.so/editor"&gt;https://readme.so/editor&lt;/a&gt;) and write amazing READMEs using WYSIWYG editor without knowing anything about markdowns.&lt;br&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/afozbek/5-ways-to-host-your-applications-4d77</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-surge"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Surge
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surge is a cloud platform for hosting static websites, which is extremely simple to use but offers customization options for those who need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WsNkHn2J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hho9fxkum66yyk9zxh10.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WsNkHn2J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hho9fxkum66yyk9zxh10.png" alt="Surge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-firebase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Firebase
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firebase Hosting is a fully managed hosting service for static and dynamic content as well as microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service is backed by SSD storage and a global CDN (content delivery network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H5AAjJfN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3v6uwzvh0pgc1s4chfjn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H5AAjJfN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3v6uwzvh0pgc1s4chfjn.png" alt="Firebase"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-vercel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Vercel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vercel is a hosting platform for frontend frameworks. After you create a pr it will automatically create an environment for you so that the team can check it before merging it. So useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W3vdmZzx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gfyqkw4t60q9n05elite.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W3vdmZzx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gfyqkw4t60q9n05elite.png" alt="Vercel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-github-pages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Github Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process and publishes a website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qZvG8XM4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzaqtfmk4u0c73ghh8x1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qZvG8XM4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bzaqtfmk4u0c73ghh8x1.png" alt="Github Pages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-netlify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Netlify
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify is a web hosting and automation platform that accelerates &lt;strong&gt;development productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deployed most of my projects to Netlify because it is so easy to use, it is supporting custom domains, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mWb2kIts--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1103jdsiispz4g15azh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mWb2kIts--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1103jdsiispz4g15azh.png" alt="Netlify"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Find Out What It Means to be a Data Scientist at Microsoft</title>
      <author>StrataScratch</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 07:11:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nate_at_stratascratch/find-out-what-it-means-to-be-a-data-scientist-at-microsoft-3e24</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nate_at_stratascratch/find-out-what-it-means-to-be-a-data-scientist-at-microsoft-3e24</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Types of data positions, their salaries, roles and required experience, and interview process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corporation was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. It is a multinational technology company mainly in the computer software business, as well as personal computers, consumer electronics products, and related products and services. According to the Forbes Global 2000 list for 2019, Microsoft is the largest company in the software and programming industry. It’s one of the biggest US IT &lt;a href="https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-the-top-5-data-science-companies/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;companies to work in as a data scientist&lt;/a&gt;, along with Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s most famous products are Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Skype, LinkedIn, Internet Explorer, and Edge web browser. As someone working in the data field, you’re probably familiar with the Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), Power BI, and Azure SQL Database too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s current OS, Windows 10, is running on more than 1.3 billion devices globally. Overall, Windows’s share of the operating system market is around 70%. However, their main revenue generator is the Intelligent Cloud segment, consisting of Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio products. Speaking of revenue, Microsoft Corporation boasts $168 billion annual revenue as of the 2021 fiscal year ended June 30. This is an increase of 18% compared to the previous year. It currently employs around 163,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the company’s revenue comes mainly from the Intelligent Cloud segment, which is based on the (cloud) handling of data, maybe it’s unnecessary to stress how important data is to Microsoft. A wide variety of other products, ranging from the most dominant operating system (Windows) to client &amp;amp; server software (Office), social media (LinkedIn), and software development Internet hosting (GitHub), shows its importance to Microsoft. Data is not used only for getting products to customers. It’s also used to change or develop products according to the end user’s behavior. And this behavior is again – data. Creating data-handling tools without knowing how data works is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, there were 9,392 job openings at Microsoft in total. Around a third of the total jobs is in the data field. You can find more information about the openings at Microsoft on their &lt;a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/search-results?from=20&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;Careers page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#microsoft-data-scientist-salaries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Microsoft Data Scientist Salaries
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick overview of the general types of data positions at Microsoft, the experience they require, with their respective salaries compared to the national average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vdJecP8z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/13yohmb8m3vijcvoreoh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vdJecP8z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/13yohmb8m3vijcvoreoh.png" alt="Microsoft Data Scientist Salaries"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table shows that Microsoft’s average salaries for these positions are above the US national’s salary upper limit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with cash and stock bonus, Microsoft gives many other benefits to their employees. For example, health, dental, disability, and life insurance, 401k, student loan repayment plan, 15 days PTO (increased to 20 days in years 7-12, and 25 days beyond that), maternity &amp;amp; paternity leave, 10 days sick time, family sickness leave, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One benefit unique to Microsoft is Childcare/Babysitting Reimbursement, which reimburses 160 hours of childcare fees per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the estimated value of all those benefits is 12k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the examples of the qualifications required for the three types of data positions mentioned in the table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G1Pdiglz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/blek0a1u3mthqswghdwa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G1Pdiglz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/blek0a1u3mthqswghdwa.png" alt="Data Analyst Position at Microsoft"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--koaf_GS---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jd04wb7x5vsy5iloyh30.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--koaf_GS---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jd04wb7x5vsy5iloyh30.png" alt="Data Scientist Position at Microsoft"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wZD6lWza--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p237zuqdstxgaqec2f03.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wZD6lWza--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p237zuqdstxgaqec2f03.png" alt="Data Engineer Position at Microsoft"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is a huge company, so a job description and requirements could differ according to the department. For example, some positions can require better financial, legal, or product knowledge. Or maybe knowing some other programming languages, besides the standard of SQL/R/Python and being versed in cloud technology. Also, the seniority of the position can influence the job requirements. Usually, the higher in the hierarchy, the soft skills start to take over the &lt;a href="https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/most-in-demand-data-science-technical-skills/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;technical skills&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from that, there are also some “crossover” data positions between data and sales positions or data and customer support positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next table, there’s a summary of the most commonly required qualifications and experience by role. Since this can differ within the same position, it’s important that you carefully read a job ad to see if it fits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#roles-and-required-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Roles and Required Experience
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UpKARGkl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eplh9pw3qjmbdsc1eawx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UpKARGkl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eplh9pw3qjmbdsc1eawx.png" alt="Roles and Required Experience for the data position at Microsoft"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-data-positions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Data Positions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data positions in Microsoft are spread across multiple company teams. There are 26 teams, and most of them require some kind of a data professional. Due to that, these three data positions above can vary significantly in their requirements from team to team. Here’s the overview of all the teams that require data job positions and their descriptions. Below is a little more detailed info about what every team does and what your job description could be. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3pgM3Jy5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7q1v4ab8qrk40nypfatw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3pgM3Jy5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7q1v4ab8qrk40nypfatw.png" alt="Types of Data Positions at Microsoft"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their tasks, of course, include keeping the current customers and establishing a long and fruitful collaboration that will see the increase in the Microsoft products’ sales and income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could use your knowledge here too. You’ll have the opportunity to:&lt;br&gt;
• Aggregate and analyze data on various levels.&lt;br&gt;
• Combine data and business knowledge to identify sales trends, processes, and opportunities.&lt;br&gt;
• Suggest improvement in the current and future sales strategies by means of regression and forecasting techniques.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Services
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team is dedicated mainly to support the customers from the technical perspective in using different Microsoft products. Depending on the products, your role as a data expert can vary, but here’s what you could expect if you get the job here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Provide technical support in problem escalation.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#supply-chain-amp-operations-management"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Supply Chain &amp;amp; Operations Management
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a team that ensures the smooth delivery of the products to the customers. This involves maintaining the supply chain of the Microsoft products and the supply chain of the materials used in their production. All that has to include efficiency from the quality, price, and time perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team offers opportunities to show your data knowledge. For example, you could be:&lt;br&gt;
• Support the supply strategies by analyzing costs.&lt;br&gt;
• Analyze and monitor product performance.&lt;br&gt;
• Support inventory planning.&lt;br&gt;
• Develop metrics and reporting according to the team’s needs.&lt;br&gt;
• Develop strategies that will overall lead to supply chain optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#technical-sales"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Technical Sales
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members of this team work on increasing revenue and market share with the strategic enterprise clients. They provide and support customers with the architectural solutions and concepts that will benefit the user’s experience with Microsoft’s intelligent cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you could use your data expertise:&lt;br&gt;
• Participate in designing and creating cloud-based and customer-oriented solutions.&lt;br&gt;
• Create a data architecture that will meet the customers’ demands.&lt;br&gt;
• Work cross-disciplinary within the customer’s department to smoothly transition to the cloud.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Technology Sales
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team also works on the client’s digital transformation by recognizing their needs and providing suggestions and technical support in that mission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you’ll also have the opportunity to showcase your technical and data knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
What you’ll work on is generally very similar to descriptions of the Technical Sales team. You’ll have to know the Microsoft products and the concepts these products are based on, such as relational databases, cloud computing, machine learning, reporting &amp;amp; analytics. You will then use that knowledge to support the customers and/or analyze the opportunities for sales increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#outlining-the-microsoft-data-scientist-interview-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Outlining the Microsoft Data Scientist Interview Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s interview process consists of several rounds and, as with all the famous technology companies, is rigorous. To increase your performance in this interview process, we’ve prepared a general overview how the process will look like. That way, you will know what to expect and be prepared. The Microsoft interview process used to consist of both virtual and on-site interviews. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the official statement by Microsoft confirms all the in-person interviews will be held virtually. This doesn’t change significantly the outline of the process overall and what you should expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you enter the interview process, you should expect the following: one phone screen and assessment, then 4-5 on-site interviews (or, better, face-to-face interviews, since the pandemic changed the approach). Here’s an overview of this process:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfvvG1Qo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8gy7ijwv2kiuz0fq7wie.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfvvG1Qo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8gy7ijwv2kiuz0fq7wie.png" alt="Outlining the Microsoft Data Scientist Interview Process"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#phone-screen-andor-the-online-assessment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Phone Screen and/or the Online Assessment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve got a call from an HR recruiter or send a job application, the first step of the interview process in Microsoft is phone screening. This first step in the process usually lasts up to 60 minutes and will involve talking to a team member or your future boss. The screening will involve your CV review. Then some questions will follow. Usually, several behavioral and one easy-to-medium coding, data structure, algorithm, or some other technical question, depending on the position you applied for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical question will be assessed via an online code editor, and you’ll be given 30 minutes to solve it. It’s also possible that you’ll only have an online assessment of your technical skills. Usually, this lasts up to 90 minutes and involves three questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#facetoface-interviews"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Face-to-Face Interviews
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase involved spending the whole day at Microsoft premises and having 4 or 5 interviews. Now, the pandemic changed this to completely virtually-held interviews. This is the most important change. As before, these interviews will all be hour-long and will be conducted one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can expect some more behavioral and technical questions. There will be more of them, and they will be more difficult than in the previous round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews will involve talking to various members of your future team with different levels of technical knowledge and fields of expertise. The last face-to-face interview will be with a senior executive who has the power to veto or approve your hiring. Again, the purpose of this interview is to ask you some questions (be it behavioral or technical) to make sure all that was maybe missed in the previous interviews is covered. As a senior executive, the interviewer will also try to talk you into accepting the employment offer if they’re to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hr-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HR Interview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step of the interviewing process will be the HR interview. This is an interview with the Human Resources employer and is more or less a formality. Here you’ll also be asked some behavioral and technical questions, but more with the purpose to make sure once again you’re the right candidate. In this interview, you’ll also discuss your salary, benefits, and other topics regarding your employment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-questions-asked-during-the-microsoft-data-scientist-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Questions Asked during the Microsoft Data Scientist Interview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s data scientist interview questions can fit in the following four categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Behavioral Questions&lt;br&gt;
• Product Sense &amp;amp; Business Cases&lt;br&gt;
• Data Analysis &amp;amp; Coding&lt;br&gt;
• Modeling Techniques&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll give you some examples of each category, along with the links to the answers and discussion pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#behavioral-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Behavioral Questions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions asked to screen your behavior at work. How you react in certain situations, build interpersonal relationships, and perform in different situations. To be more specific, here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Why are you leaving your current job?&lt;br&gt;
• Why do you want to work at Microsoft?&lt;br&gt;
• Describe a time when you had to learn a new technical skill on the job.&lt;br&gt;
• Tell us about some of the biggest lessons you've learned in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you’ll need to express yourself, present yourself as a person and a professional. The most important thing is what you want to say, but it’s also important to know how to say it. You could &lt;a href="https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-tell-your-story-in-an-interview/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;use our article for more guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#product-sense-amp-business-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Product Sense &amp;amp; Business Cases
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you’ll have to show how well you know Microsoft and its products. You’ll also have to answer the questions that require thinking and showing the ‘feeling’ for numbers, data, and estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Explain a recursion to me like I’m 5 years old.&lt;br&gt;
• How would you design an alarm clock for deaf people?&lt;br&gt;
• What is your favorite Microsoft product and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-analysis-amp-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Analysis &amp;amp; Coding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are technical questions designed to screen your theoretical and practical knowledge in data analysis, data handling, and code writing. Here are some questions that you might be asked at Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10300-premium-vs-freemium?python=&amp;amp;utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;Find the total number of downloads for paying and non-paying users by date&lt;/a&gt;.​&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10299-finding-updated-records?python=&amp;amp;utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year&lt;/a&gt;.​&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10301-expensive-projects?python=&amp;amp;utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;Given a list of projects and employees mapped to each project, calculate by the amount of project budget allocated to each employee&lt;/a&gt;.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#modeling-techniques"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Modeling Techniques
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions intend to test your statistical, mathematical, and model-building knowledge. Here are the example questions you could expect when being interviewed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/technical/2047-computational-tricks?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;How to compute an inverse matrix faster by playing around with some computational tricks?​&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/technical/2231-new-observation-is-outlier?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;How do you detect if a new observation is outlier?​&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• &lt;a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/technical/2243-definition-of-variance?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=click&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dev.to"&gt;What is the definition of the variance?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quick-tips"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quick Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Do your research on Microsoft, its industry, and how your role contributes to the company.&lt;br&gt;
• Be informed about the interview process and Microsoft products, especially if this is a product-oriented position.&lt;br&gt;
• Don’t think only about the current position, but think about where this position could lead you within the organization.&lt;br&gt;
• Be in touch with the latest ideas and developments in the tech industry.&lt;br&gt;
• Since all the interviews are currently held virtually, make your environment as comfortable as possible and check your equipment to avoid any technical difficulties.&lt;br&gt;
• Work on your technical and non-technical knowledge; assess the holes in your knowledge and/or experience, and try to patch them.&lt;br&gt;
• Don’t lose hope; even if you don’t get the job, you will gain interview experience which can help you to get your next job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#additional-resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Additional Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>My lessons after moving from CloudFormation to CDK</title>
      <author>Igor</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 07:04:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/grenguar/my-learnings-after-moving-from-cloudformation-to-cdk-cin</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/grenguar/my-learnings-after-moving-from-cloudformation-to-cdk-cin</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nowadays there is no doubt that 'Infrastructure as real code' is a way of cloud resources provisioning. CDK is an incredible way of doing this in the AWS ecosystem. This article will talk about the situation when the Cloudformation template is in place and you want to make a new setup with the CDK using Typescript. The opinions are my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-case"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Case
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine you have a new project in a team where CFN was used for a long time. There is a lot of boilerplate already and people are repeating the same things over and over again. There is also some custom CI/CD setup in place. With this background - you are set to start a new project with CDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excited? Me too. But there are some complications because CFN is a YAML/JSON-based templating mechanism. CDK in short is an abstraction on top of CFN which is using a programming language for provisioning infrastructure in a structured way. Here are my tips on how to start switching from Cloudformation/SAM after using the tool for almost a year now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-with-a-small%C2%A0project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start with a small project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a project without many elements. Try to avoid projects where you need to set up VPC by yourself. Also, it will be better to avoid projects with container orchestrations using ECS or Kubernetes. The ideal first project will be the one having S3, Lambda, CloudFront, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM permissions. Example projects can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduled event placing data into S3/DynamoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event from Github/Bitbucket &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The API call to do some simple job like routing request to another party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point is to use CDK version 2. x. In most of the guides, it will be suggested to utilize the first one. It is outdated and has many dependencies issues. The developing experience will be much more delightful. For installing it -  run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install cdk@next
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#study-cdk-basic%C2%A0concepts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Study CDK basic concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple important terms when it comes to CDK. The first one is 'App'. It is the root element of the structure. There you can describe the stacks and their creation.&lt;br&gt;
The most interesting concept is a construct. From AWS docs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constructs are the basic building blocks of AWS CDK apps. A construct represents a "cloud component" and encapsulates everything AWS CloudFormation needs to create the component.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is basically a module of the resources packed together as a logical unit. The constructs are having different levels of abstraction. There are ones that are the closest to the CloudFormation. Typically, they have poor typing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 levels of abstraction: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CFN resources  - they are mapped to the underlined CFN resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 2  - they give the abstractions and typing. The constructs can be also coming from the library here. Many constructs will allow having types and making fewer mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level 3 - these are the whole patterns. They can be done by AWS or other developers. The ones coming from AWS advocates and heroes could be found here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the power of CDK lies in the third level. It gives the possibility to automate the creation of very common patterns in your team. For example, it can be a custom domain or pipeline setup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#planning-the%C2%A0stacks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Planning the stacks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important point is to have an idea of how many stacks will you need to succeed in the provisioning of the infrastructure. One stack is not helpful in many cases. It means that stacks should be architecture in a way that each of them solves one problem. It can be an issue to determine whether to use the construct or the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to AWS documentation: "A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit." When you have an API with Lambdas - this can be a stack. However, if you have databases and other types of storage - this can be another stack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing which comes quite often, in the end, is how the stacks will talk with each other. There are multiple ways of doing this. You can either pass general props or the whole stack as an input to the next one, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#always-check-original-documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Always check original documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CDK is just awesome, from my point of view. But it is not saving us from reading and understanding Cloudformation. De-facto CDK is synthesizing the CloudFormation template in JSON format. Thus, it is obligatory to see what it is doing for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are great tricks hidden in the official documentation when you are actually reading it. Most of the time, I am googling something like 'AWS::DynamoDB::Table'. The response will give the needed documentation page for the infrastructure element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#failures-are-essential"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Failures are essential
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey with CDK started with the failure of deployment when I tried to have an S3 bucket created. It took 15 minutes to deploy it with no success. It is ok to fail with CDK in the beginning. Do not try to hurry and migrate the whole application at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of the projects, I had a CI/CD setup done with SAM and CloudFormation. Migration of it completely to CDK would take time from the actual feature development. So the solution was to migrate the implementation code infrastructure to CDK and rest the pipeline with the same setup. I learned a lot during this transition for the next project where I took the whole infrastructure into CDK.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;All in all, CDK is worth to be tried on the next PoC or internal tool because it gives the real coding experience while doing infrastructure. This is especially important when you are going to use a DevOps mindset for the new features where engineers are responsible for not only the implementation. Usage of the same language for the IaC tool eliminates the context switching between TypeScript and YAML. Thus, it will increase the productivity of the whole team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My love-hate relationship with the fundamentals</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate relationship with the “fundamentals”. Be it learning to code, picking up new skills and knowledge, developing new habits, I’m the impatient sort who loves to jump right in and try things out, even if I don’t know what I’m doing. I hated how veteran gatekeepers of any field/niche would police newbies by using “the fundamentals” as some sort of an entrance exam. I felt that learning the fundamentals through some 100-hour boring course hinders more than it helps. But sometimes, that’s when the long arm of the fundamentals come back to bite me. With good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like how I just solved the epic bug that’s been causing slow page loads on my product &lt;a href="https://golifelog.com"&gt;Lifelog&lt;/a&gt;. A 4am late night. Three full days of debugging trial by fire. I lost count of how many things I tried, on both frontend and backend. I recall that at some point I felt so demotivated and low in morale that thoughts of giving up altogether came to me. In the end, it was a silly little Javascript function in charge of sorting comments. All that herculean effort and sleepless nights, only to find that the solution was so small and simple. Comically simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that such scenarios—of inflated perceptions of difficulty unfolding into a laughable realisation of the solution—are usually signs that the fundamentals are missing. If I had taken the boring and labourious yet effective approach of debugging by commenting out code bit by bit, I wouldn’t have needed 4am late nights and three wasted days. Yet, here I am, deeply humbled due to a combination of newbie inexperience, impatience with the fundamentals, and that just-want-to-do-my-own-way personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great learning point, and even greater validation of why the fundamentals matter, not just in coding but any pursuit of skill or knowledge. Not that everyone now has to know the fundamentals before starting any pursuit. But more like the fundamentals cannot be ignored, and incidents like this are signals that I need to brush up on them, rather than haughtily brushing them off like I knew better.&lt;/p&gt;
