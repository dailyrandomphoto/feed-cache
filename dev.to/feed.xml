      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern payment card issuing processes can deliver many different types of cards in a fast, efficient, and secure way. Using open API platforms, card issuers can create customized card products and easily process hundreds of thousands of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By integrating with major card processing networks around the world, modern card issuing systems allow businesses to create payment solutions that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a resilient and secure infrastructure on a global level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fit their customers’ needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring flexibility and ease of customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale rapidly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide quick and easy marketability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article provides an introduction to the modern payment card issuing process and how Marqeta’s open API works at the heart of it. It will help both software developers new to payment card systems and experienced technical professionals who may need a refresher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a brief history lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-did-we-get-here"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Did We Get Here?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit card terminals were first introduced in the late ’70s. While the electronic payment platforms brought new innovations to the retail industry at the time, the decades that followed saw muted technological development in the card issuing and processing space. Since this was all pre-internet, a huge network of telecommunications and data management platforms were put into place to ensure electronic payment services were available worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the widespread use of the internet, early adopters of ecommerce businesses like Amazon and eBay began to attract a massive number of regular customers. This began the trend of businesses using electronic payment services. However, relatively smaller businesses still weren’t ready or able to adopt the technology... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… until this last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, there has been an explosion of innovation in distributed, fault-tolerant application development. Businesses began moving to a digital-first approach and using electronic payment services. Advancements in products like debit cards and e-wallets now allow easier access to electronic payment services. On top of this, innovative businesses began looking for ways to &lt;em&gt;issue their own cards&lt;/em&gt;, setting up custom payment programs while bypassing traditional card-issuing banks altogether. For example, on-demand delivery companies like &lt;a href="https://www.marqeta.com/blog/2020/04/09/on-demand-delivery-surge"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.marqeta.com/blog/2020/04/20/doordash-marqeta-seamless-payments"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; use custom-issued cards for all of their delivery staff to use at restaurants and groceries, in order to streamline the payment flow. This boom has led to the rise of the modern payment card issuing business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#payment-card-transactions-the-key-players"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Payment Card Transactions: The Key Players
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electronic payment processing industry has a lot of moving pieces, but a basic understanding of its key players is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cardholders-and-merchants"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cardholders and Merchants
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic card transaction involves two parties—the cardholder and the merchant—transacting funds via a &lt;em&gt;payment scheme&lt;/em&gt;. Simply put, the &lt;em&gt;cardholder&lt;/em&gt; (also commonly known as the &lt;em&gt;consumer** **_or _payer&lt;/em&gt;) uses a payment card to pay for a product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;merchant&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;payee&lt;/em&gt;) sells the product or service to receive the payment. However, to ensure that the cardholder can pay and the merchant can receive, more parties are involved in the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the cardholder presents a card for payment, the merchant requests authorization for a payment transaction on that card. To accept these types of payments, the merchant must open a merchant account with a &lt;em&gt;payment processor&lt;/em&gt; to settle the funds. By offering this efficient means of payment, the merchant can cater to a wider array of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-payment-processor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Payment Processor
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Payment processors&lt;/em&gt; are financial institutions that provide merchants the means to accept electronic payments. A payment processor facilitates the transaction between a merchant and the &lt;em&gt;card network&lt;/em&gt;. Using the appropriate &lt;em&gt;card network&lt;/em&gt;, the processor captures the transaction information and forwards it to the cardholder’s &lt;em&gt;issuing bank&lt;/em&gt; (also known as the &lt;em&gt;issuer&lt;/em&gt;) for approval. When the transaction is approved by the issuer, the payment processor also settles the funds with the merchant along with all the related fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-card-network"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Card Network
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the flow of transaction information between a processor and the issuer, a &lt;em&gt;card network&lt;/em&gt; (for example, Visa or Mastercard) is involved. These global institutions provide the underlying infrastructure, communications, standards, and processes to facilitate financial transactions across geographic boundaries by passing information and funds between processors and issuers. In return, they charge the payment processors and issuers with a license or card scheme fee. These networks also set the standards that processors and issuers must follow for communication, dispute resolution, and other processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-issuer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Issuer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the _issuer—_a financial institution (most commonly a bank) that provides cardholders with payment cards and determines the spending limit on those cards. They also manage payment authentication and information about the cardholder. For a payment to be successful, the issuer is responsible for checking that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transaction is valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The card belongs to a valid and trusted cardholder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cardholder has enough funds (or credit) to make this payment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the card issuer and the payment processor can be the same institution. In these cases, the merchant isn’t charged any fees for the transaction between the issuer and the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-rise-of-digital-payment-solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Rise of Digital Payment Solutions
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, legacy card issuers offer one-size-fits-all products, many of which simply don’t fit the needs of certain customers. In particular, modern startups and digital-first businesses may be looking for features such as in-app payments and cryptocurrency transactions. These businesses need a &lt;strong&gt;highly flexible yet robust payment solution&lt;/strong&gt;—custom payment card products and associated payment methods—which they aren’t finding in legacy card issuers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This need is fuelled by the daily movement of millions of dollars worth of ecommerce transactions, which has been brought about by many factors, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ease of building financial transaction-based applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ubiquity of mobile phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The widespread use of social media platforms for buying and selling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovations like mobile point-of-sale systems are making it much easier for smaller players to enter the electronic payment industry. The number of digital payment users is increasing rapidly. Add to this changing customer preferences and their need to close transactions faster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put all of this together, and you can see why there’s a growing appetite among businesses and software developers for digital-first solutions in the payment industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications built with digital payment solutions have provided new ways to pay for goods and services, giving businesses a critical edge over their competitors. Pioneered by startups like Uber, custom cards now allow businesses to have their own &lt;strong&gt;configurable payment cards&lt;/strong&gt; and a simpler way to &lt;strong&gt;manage payment programs&lt;/strong&gt; and even roll out their own rewards systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new custom payment systems are made possible because of the open API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-open-api-innovation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Open API Innovation
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, financial institutions have used &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8583:-1:en"&gt;ISO 8583&lt;/a&gt;, the international standard for facilitating the flow of transaction information around the globe. Over the years, the standard has undergone numerous changes to support newer technology, but there are still many limitations and barriers to entry. Businesses and developers began searching for a &lt;strong&gt;resilient solution without the burden of decades-old monolithic processes&lt;/strong&gt;. This led to Marqeta’s creation of the open API for the payment card. In short, this API provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A granular breakdown of ISO 8583 processes for handling card transaction steps, abstracting away the monolithic and opaque approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to handle all facets of digital finance, including funding, security, transaction processing, and notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmable, flexible, and performant interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-an-open-api-mean-for-payment-card-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Does An Open API Mean for Payment Card Developers?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISO 8583 requires developers to strictly adhere to the entire transaction process flow. Marqeta’s API breaks down this monolithic payment flow into many well-defined and modular services, allowing developers more control over building custom applications while still meeting ISO 8583 obligations. This granular approach also lets developers add features or notification hooks between payment process steps for a better handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#json-messaging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JSON Messaging
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major advancement that comes with this API is the use of key-value pairs formatted as JSON (a versatile data interchange standard). This is in contrast to ISO 8583 messaging, which uses opaque and esoteric codes. Legacy payment processing systems, which had to translate these codes, ended up with time-consuming and error-prone processes. Legacy system developers often have to build separate integrations for different card networks depending on the network’s unique message formats. Since the JSON messaging standard uses labels instead of codes, all of these problems disappear with the use of Marqeta’s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an ISO 8583 message would be an opaque string that looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;010038C45934242420000042420000000330000037384992827492002827162889q839049f-839C01840f108
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Marqeta platform translates this to developer-friendly JSON like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{​
  "token": "7bce6b80-d41e-439a-a51f-3654bf586fde",
  "user_token": "ad664734-1203-4a06-9c9c-27407a6909a6",
  "card_token": "71994a77-ca7b-47b0-a5ac-867fb2fd7e4f",
  "type": "authorization",
  "amount": 100.0,
  "network": "VISA",
   ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#metadata-and-transaction-matching"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Metadata and Transaction Matching
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another change that the API introduces is the ability to add metadata to messages. This makes it easier to reconcile transactions with order management systems. When an order ID can be added to a transaction message, then the result is &lt;em&gt;transaction matching&lt;/em&gt;. Matching authorization messages at the time of sale to subsequent events of the same transaction (such as clearing records, reversals, refunds, voids, and so on) means businesses can release holds on cardholder funds with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publicly-available-documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publicly Available Documentation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open APIs come with publicly available documentation. The documentation allows new developers to start building card applications with ease, and it allows experienced professionals to identify potential vulnerabilities. This in turn promotes rapid innovation and improvement through feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#development-sandbox"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Development Sandbox
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marqeta’s API is available for testing and simulation within a sandbox, allowing developers to explore its features. Developers can quickly build, test, and provision  cards for testing without involving a card-issuing vendor. They have full control and flexibility in customizing their users’ card experiences. This control over customization means more fine-tuned products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#builtin-compliance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Built-in Compliance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of the API don’t have to think about implementing practices for PCI-DSS compliance. All PCI-compliant security practices are already handled by Marqeta. Developers can immediately display their cards in apps and enable PIN activation without the need for obtaining their own PCI certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#global-scalability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Global Scalability
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open API also allows payment developers to scale their payment card programs at a global level. A modern card issuing platform is designed for a build-once, deploy-anywhere approach; it doesn’t need to integrate with each local card network separately. Also, the API’s back-end typically runs on cloud infrastructures that can automatically scale as usage grows. Developers no longer need to worry about redundancy or provisioning extra resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#digital-wallets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Digital Wallets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital wallet tokenization is another important part of modern card issuing with Marqeta’s open APIs. The API integrates with digital wallet providers like Apple Pay or Google Pay (and global card networks like Mastercard and Visa), allowing API consumers to issue virtual cards or create digital wallets instantly. The platform also provides encrypted and tokenized card data for digital wallet integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#event-notification"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Event Notification
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the API comes with built-in &lt;a href="https://community.marqeta.com/t5/knowledge-base/how-to-use-marqeta-webhooks/ta-p/325"&gt;webhooks&lt;/a&gt; for event notifications. This helps with event logging, transaction record maintenance, and the building of a rich end-user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-words"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Words
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to develop and issue customizable and flexible card products without sacrificing security and scalability means financial businesses can now gain an edge over their competitors. This modern card issuing process comes in a simple and efficient package to foster rapid development and faster time to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marqeta.com/docs/core-api/introduction"&gt;Marqeta’s Core API&lt;/a&gt; offers developers an easy-to-use platform for rapid-launching card products and their iterative development. The API takes care of PCI compliance, tokenization, and integration from the very beginning. It also ensures flexibility through an almost endless list of customizations available for all aspects of a card program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the API provides developers with a trusted payment processing environment with industry-standard security, real-time notifications, and pre-built reports and visualizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, with Marqeta’s Core API, modern card developers build their product only once, and then they can deploy it anywhere in the world without needing to integrate with local card networks. The API is built on a resilient cloud infrastructure that ensures business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic payments with payment cards began 50 years ago. After 40 years of relative technological quiet in the space, we’ve seen an explosion of innovation in the digital payment space in the last decade. With that, we’ve seen the birth of modern card issuing—Marqeta’s open API—that enables today’s developers to build custom card issuing and payment programs for tomorrow’s digital-first industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accelerate Your Learnings With Web3Community and Build Your First Web 3.0 App</title>
      <author>Krish Gupta</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 15:18:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/web3community/accelerate-your-learnings-with-web3community-and-build-your-first-web-3-0-app-1810</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/web3community/accelerate-your-learnings-with-web3community-and-build-your-first-web-3-0-app-1810</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-web-30-all-about"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's Web 3.0 all about?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this question, We'd need to first deep dive into Web2.0, for a better understanding of the web&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web20"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web2.0
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web2 is simply the web we know and love right now. Web2 is like the interactive web. Web2 is also the web which allowed no-code/low-code apps into the internet. This form of the web is the most popular one. All of us have experienced. Even this site, dev.to is web2 application. If you've worked with JS Frameworks like React and Angular they are also the part of web2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious and wanna learn more about web2, there's a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"&gt;Wikipedia Page for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PVBIMcRh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1fwqani7ohw2v2fy27mo.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PVBIMcRh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1fwqani7ohw2v2fy27mo.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem-with-web2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem with Web2
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest, new technologies are only useful if they fix a flaw or pain with the older one. The problems in Web2 led to the creation of Web3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web2 lacked in &lt;strong&gt;Monetization and Security&lt;/strong&gt;, few of the really important concepts in building applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In web2 the only two major methods of earning turn out to be, either selling data and infringing with privacy or advertisements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Web2 companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, collect your data and provide you with personalised ads. Turning into more ad revenue. The web2 application experience a lot of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches"&gt;Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt;. Web 3 solves most of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-30"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web 3.0
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web 3 is simply web2 but with more security, self-governing, distributiveness and more. Web 3 applications more commonly run on blockchain technologies or decentralised networks. Users usually pay to use the services just like we pay cloud providers like GCP and AWS, but instead the money directly goes to the other users/participants. Web 3 also offers native payments, reducing as  much data-collection as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-the-web3community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's the Web3Community?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web3community.github.io/"&gt;Web3Community&lt;/a&gt; is a community that focus on Web 3, Blockchain, and somewhat related to decentralized applications (Dapp). Here you will learn how to become a blockchain developer while having fun with other community members. Blockchain Developer is an interesting field, in demand and the latest trend in the tech industry. Here you will get to interact with some great folks and learn blockchain technology together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-you-first-web-3-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building you first Web 3 App
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web 3 consists of a lot of types of applications you could build like blockchain, dapp, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've created a whole &lt;a href="https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path"&gt;learning curriculum&lt;/a&gt; for Web 3 Dev. Here you will learn how to become one of the Dapp Developers and collaborate with other people inside of web3community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple web application example with Refine</title>
      <author>Aydın Akyol</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 15:14:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pankod/simple-web-application-example-with-refine-362j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pankod/simple-web-application-example-with-refine-362j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to develop a web application quickly? You are at the right place! I will develop a simple movie web application with &lt;strong&gt;refine&lt;/strong&gt; on the frontend and &lt;strong&gt;Supabase&lt;/strong&gt; on the backend, you should continue reading. I will try to explain it step by step in a very simple way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-refine-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Refine setup
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two alternative methods to set up a refine application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended way is using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/superplate"&gt;superplate&lt;/a&gt; tool. superplate's CLI wizard will let you create and customize your application in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you may use the create-react-app tool to create an empty React application and then add refine module via npm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will use superplate-cli and select a Supabase. You can customize other options as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K4FlDVqA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgdv4sho46twm603jlft.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K4FlDVqA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgdv4sho46twm603jlft.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-create-admin-panel-with-refine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Create admin panel with refine
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should add our Supabase url and key in &lt;em&gt;supabaseClient.tsx&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add custom login page in &lt;em&gt;App.tsx&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;App.tsx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine/dist/styles.min.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine-supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./authProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabaseClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;utility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./pages/login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabaseClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;authProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;LoginPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Login page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AntdLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Typography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Checkbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;images&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ImageField&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Not found any images&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;subTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;premiere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;extra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;renderDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>The production database just went down! What do I do?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/the-production-database-just-went-down-what-do-i-do-1734</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lqm1LSal--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5onkzkud8757h9lxkr2c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Lqm1LSal--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5onkzkud8757h9lxkr2c.png" alt="mssql-server"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of my colleagues can relate with the title of this article, they might have experienced an issue with the database in production. Dear colleague, you are not alone. Panicking during a disaster in production has happened to the best of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can recall asking a friend a question about his experience during a disaster in production. He encountered a very serious disaster and he did not know what to do, felt like taking his bag and running away from the office. This colleague of mine is very good at what he does, he decided to relax and take a second look at the issue. A few moments later, he was able to find the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an ISO 22301 lead implementer, my major responsibility is to ensure there is business continuity in place in an organization. There must be a business continuity plan in place to guard against any disaster whenever it strikes and to ensure that the business continues running accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production environments are very sensitive, especially database environments. It is very important for engineers managing these environments to undergo training concerning disaster recovery, business continuity, and disaster recovery plan. Whenever a disaster strikes, everybody knows what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database administrators need to ensure the following are executed regularly to prevent any surprises before they occur.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regular-backup-and-restore-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regular backup and restore test
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some database administrators rely majorly on restoring a backup in case of disaster but do not test them beforehand to know whether they are valid or not. The rule of the thumb is to create a process of automating backup restore periodically and confirm that the recent restore is valid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This restore should be automated periodically, at least twice a month is fine. Once the restore is done, scripts to check the database integrity will be executed against the database. If there are issues, they should be addressed immediately and the restored database dropped afterward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database-backup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Database Backup
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automated database backup in form of jobs needs to be set up and configured on the database for full backup, differential, and transactional log backup; with email notification to database administrators for backup status (failure or success)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database-high-availability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Database High Availability
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is very essentials for every database in production to be on high availability, this will guarantee an up-time or availability of 99.99999% equivalent to 100%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Configuring database high availability simply means there will be more than one (1) instance of a database server running; once an instance fails, there will be an automatic failover to any of other instances. However, if the database is on high availability we can easily failover to the other instances in cases of any disaster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During any disaster or emergency, I will recommend the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay positive and extremely calm to prevent more future damage. This also prevents mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raise an incident. It is very important to inform our customers or colleagues about the current situations. This is very good because it will indicate that we are aware of the current situation and also working on a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if there is a recent backup which must include at least a recent full backup (and recent differential backup and a transactional log backup where applicable). If there is a recent backup and you can accommodate data loss, you can restore this database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if the affected database can be made available by running different scripts such as dbcc check DB or any other related scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failover the database to the DR instance (alternative instance), if the database is on high availability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, please do let me know if you find this article interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ancient computer science: Let's build a Roman numeral converter from scratch 🏺📜</title>
      <author>Pascal Thormeier</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/thormeier/ancient-computer-science-let-s-build-a-roman-numeral-converter-from-scratch-4ga7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thormeier/ancient-computer-science-let-s-build-a-roman-numeral-converter-from-scratch-4ga7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, we're going time travelling! Let's go back to the year CCXVII, so 217, all the way to the iron age: The Roman empire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today we're not exploring the Colosseum or the Pantheon, neither will we talk to legionnaires or walk the Cursus publicus. Instead we'll learn about a concept that enabled a big part of the Roman economy as well as some of the most magnificent architectural masterpieces. Today's topic are Roman numerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wait-how-on-earth-does-ccxvii-translate-to-217"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wait, how on earth does CCXVII translate to 217?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very good question! Let's analyse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Short interlude: In case you didn't know, the digits we're used to (0-9), are called "Arabic numerals", since they originated in the western part of the Arabian and North African part of the world.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, what do C, X, V and I mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This table gives an overview of the Roman numeral digits and their value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Roman numeral digit&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Arabic numerals, Roman numerals consist of digits. The digits, however, don't exactly correspond to different values at different places (for example, 217 would be 2 * 100, 1 * 10 and 7 * 1), but instead, they add to a larger number. The amount of same digits correspond to the value. We could therefore rewrite &lt;code&gt;CCXVII&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;C + C + X + V + I + I&lt;/code&gt;. With the above table, this translates to &lt;code&gt;100 + 100 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 217&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, the number 4 could be written as &lt;code&gt;IIII&lt;/code&gt;, right? Almost! While this might be the intuitive answer, the inventors decided that this was not the way to go. Instead, everything that cannot be written with an addition of maximum three same digits is written as a subtraction from the next larger number. So, instead of writing &lt;code&gt;1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4&lt;/code&gt;, we write &lt;code&gt;5 - 1 = 4&lt;/code&gt;, in Roman numerals &lt;code&gt;V - I&lt;/code&gt; or simply &lt;code&gt;IV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this means if digit A (&lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; of digit B) is smaller than digit B, it's subtracted, otherwise added. To illustrate:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;IV --&amp;gt; I &amp;lt; V --&amp;gt; V - I
But:
VI --&amp;gt; V &amp;gt; I --&amp;gt; V + I
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This works for any number:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CDXLIV 
--&amp;gt; (D - C) + (L - X) + (V - I) 
= (500 - 100) + (50 - 10) + (5 - 1) = 444

XC = (100 - 10) = 90
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, 99 is not written as &lt;code&gt;100 - 1&lt;/code&gt;, but as &lt;code&gt;(100 - 10) + (10 - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, these are the rules to convert a single digit base 10 number &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; to Roman numerals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If N &amp;lt;= 3, repeat &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; 1 to 3 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If N === 4, it's 5 - 1, so &lt;code&gt;VI&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If N === 5, it's &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If N &amp;lt; 9, it's 5 + repeat &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; 1 to 3 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If N === 9, it's 10 - 1, so &lt;code&gt;IX&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the above table, we'll notice that for every power of 10 up to 1000 (1, 10, 100, 1000), there's singles (1, 10, etc.) and fives (5, 50, 500) - we can therefore repeat the steps above for every power of 10 and change the set of digits we use accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#coding-from-base10-to-roman"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coding from base10 to Roman
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we translate the usual base 10 numbers into Roman numerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a simple map of Roman numerals to numbers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to implement the rules for converting single digits. The rules above can be translated to a set of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements directly, we only need to know the power of 10 as well, so we chose the right Roman numeral digits:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Translates a single digit in respect of the power of 10 into a Roman numeral.
 * @param n
 * @param powerOf10
 * @returns {*|string}
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numDigitToRomDigits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// I, II, III, X, X, XXX, C, CC, CCC&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// IV, XL, CD&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// V, L, D&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// VI, VII, VIII, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// MC, XC, IX&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;powerOf10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's try this out:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numDigitToRomDigits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "70", yields `LXX`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numDigitToRomDigits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "500", yields `D`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numDigitToRomDigits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "3", yields `III`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numDigitToRomDigits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "40", yields `XL`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That looks good! Now, we can use this function to convert larger numbers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Translates an entire number to Roman numerals.
 * @param x
 * @returns {string}
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2rom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Split number into digits and reverse, &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// so figuring out the power of 10 is easier.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Larger numbers don't work, 5000 is written &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// as V with a dash on top, we don't have that &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// character...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Numbers larger than 3999 cannot be converted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Loop over all digits, convert them each&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numDigitToRomDigits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Attach to front of already converted&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's try that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2rom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3724&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// yields `MMMDCCXXIV` - works!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-roman-numerals-to-base-10-again"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From Roman numerals to base 10 again
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way is going to be bit trickier - we need to parse Roman numerals and convert them back to base10 again. First, we flip the map from earlier. &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67047036"&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; tells us how to do this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flipObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;base10Numerals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flipObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;romanNumerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* yields
{
  C: "100"
  D: "500"
  I: "1"
  L: "50"
  M: "1000"
  V: "5"
  X: "10"
}
*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The subtraction/addition method is what we're going to implement now. We know that larger numbers left of other numbers are added. If the number on the left is smaller, it's subtracted. So, basically: &lt;code&gt;VI = V + I&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;IV = V - I&lt;/code&gt;. Since there's no such thing as &lt;code&gt;IIV&lt;/code&gt;, we can check the number that comes next to determine if we add or subtract the current number. So, something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;From left to right,
If next number to the right is larger:
  Subtract current digit
Else
  Add current digit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In code, it would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Converts a roman number to base10.
 * @param x
 * @returns {number}
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rom2num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Split number and assign base10 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// value to each digit.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// parseInt is necessary, because the &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// flip yields strings.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;base10Numerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Loop over every digit&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// If number to the right larger than the &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// current number&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;digits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's see if that works by converting all numbers from 1 to 3999 back and forth:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rom2num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2rom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true, works!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The result
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need some input fields and buttons, and voila:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/thormeier/embed/XWgwPRZ?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew, enough ancient times for now, let's go back to the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's build an app to manage your hackathons with refine</title>
      <author>mhrrmk</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 15:05:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pankod/let-s-build-an-app-to-manage-your-hackathons-with-refine-2hn5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pankod/let-s-build-an-app-to-manage-your-hackathons-with-refine-2hn5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We'll be building a demo app to manage hackathons with &lt;a href="//refine.dev"&gt;refine&lt;/a&gt;. We'll be able to create new hackathons, new project entries for a hackathon and criterias for a hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gtjTmNFb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rj13g0aswiac7tce5a6m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gtjTmNFb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rj13g0aswiac7tce5a6m.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll use &lt;a href="//supabase.io"&gt;supabase&lt;/a&gt; as the backend service. &lt;strong&gt;refine&lt;/strong&gt; comes with a builtin data provider for supabase thus it's very easy to create crud pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-tables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating tables
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our app will have these tables in supabase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criterias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hackathons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hackathoners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;projectscores
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are reflected in our app as&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonerType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;team_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProjectType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;hackathon_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;hackathoner_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CriteriaType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;hackathon_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProjectScoreType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;criteria_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#craeting-crud-pages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Craeting CRUD pages
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating crud pages is as easy like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShowButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;EditButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TextField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dayjs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dayjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tableProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tableProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rowKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ID"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;saveButtonProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;saveButtonProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"start"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;DatePicker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"end"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;DatePicker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then use these pages as the corresponding crud component for the &lt;code&gt;hackathon&lt;/code&gt; resource:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine/dist/styles.min.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine-supabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabaseClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;utility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsShow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./pages/hackathons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;supabaseClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"hackathons"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonsShow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eXkHAQEH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q99q04aj30vl4vli4wh2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eXkHAQEH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q99q04aj30vl4vli4wh2.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;refine&lt;/strong&gt; comes with builtin hooks for Ant design components. You can find detailed usage for the hooks and supabase in the &lt;a href="//refine.dev/docs"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-voting-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating voting page
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll use the dashboard option to place voting page. We'll need data from different resources. &lt;strong&gt;refine&lt;/strong&gt; comes with powerful hooks that are based on react-query to get data from those resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example to get the hackathons that are active now we can use the &lt;code&gt;useList&lt;/code&gt; hook:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DashboardPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentHackathons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HackathonType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hackathons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;lte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;gte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can get data from other resources in a similar fashion. You can find the codesandbox &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/9oc34"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/hackathonize"&gt;repo here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project itself is a product of a hackathon. It lacks lots of feature like authorization though it shows how &lt;strong&gt;refine&lt;/strong&gt; makes it easy to quickly build a working app.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a feedback admin panel in 15 minutes with refine and Strapi</title>
      <author>Salih Özdemir</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 15:00:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pankod/create-a-feedback-admin-panel-in-15-minutes-with-refine-and-strapi-3i2p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pankod/create-a-feedback-admin-panel-in-15-minutes-with-refine-and-strapi-3i2p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will create a panel where we can manage the feedback we receive from our web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will quickly create an api with &lt;a href="https://strapi.io"&gt;Strapi.io&lt;/a&gt; and then develop its frontend with &lt;a href="https://refine.dev"&gt;refine&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, let's see how an admin panel can be created in a very short time with the perfect harmony of Strapi and refine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features that our panel will have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication with strapi.io&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A page to list feedbacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutation on Feedbacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-api-with-raw-strapi-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating api with &lt;code&gt;Strapi&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create our backend project with Strapi's &lt;a href="//https:/strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html"&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-strapi-app strapi-feedback-api &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--quickstart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the installation is complete, the tab will automatically open in the browser. Here, let's create a &lt;code&gt;feedback&lt;/code&gt; collection with Content-Types Builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, a feedback should have a &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; text field, A &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; text field that shows the page the feedback was sent from, and a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; enumeration field indicating the type of feedback (issue, idea, other, archive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K66N2jIm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8dt3hlv965jb1evpe10o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K66N2jIm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8dt3hlv965jb1evpe10o.png" alt="strapi-create-collection"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-panel-with-raw-refine-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating panel with &lt;code&gt;refine&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create our frontend project with refine's &lt;a href="https://refine.dev/docs/#setting-up"&gt;setting up guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two alternative methods to set up a refine application. We will quickly create our application with &lt;a href="https://pankod.github.io/superplate"&gt;superplate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx superplate-cli refine-feedback-client
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Select the following options to complete the CLI wizard:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;? Select your project type:
❯ refine

? What will be the name of your app:
refine-strapi-web

? Package manager:
❯ Npm

? Do you want to customize the theme?:
❯ No (Ant Design default theme)

? Data Provider :
❯ Strapi

? Do you want to customize layout?
❯ Yes, I want

? i18n - Internationalization:
❯ No
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the installation is completed, Strapi-specific &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/master/packages/strapi"&gt;data provider&lt;/a&gt;, auth provider, and also layout components that we can change the default view of Refine with the custom layout option will be included in our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, bootstrap the app with the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--54p_ZgGR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fz5hbeb86o78k2gj183f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--54p_ZgGR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fz5hbeb86o78k2gj183f.png" alt="bootstrap-the-app"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's list the changes we will make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change our Strapi API URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove components that we will not use when changing the refinement look&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding resources according to the collection name we created in Strapi
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight diff"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;- import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine";
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+ import { Refine, Resource } from "@pankod/refine";
&lt;/span&gt;
import "@pankod/refine/dist/styles.min.css";
&lt;span class="p"&gt;import { DataProvider } from "@pankod/refine-strapi";
import strapiAuthProvider from "authProvider";
import {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;- Title,
&lt;/span&gt;  Header,
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;- Sider,
- Footer,
&lt;/span&gt;  Layout,
  OffLayoutArea,
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; from "components";

function App() {
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-  const API_URL = "your-strapi-api-url";
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+  const API_URL = "http://localhost:1337";
&lt;/span&gt;
  const { authProvider, axiosInstance } = strapiAuthProvider(API_URL);
  const dataProvider = DataProvider(API_URL, axiosInstance);
  return (
    &amp;lt;Refine
      dataProvider={dataProvider}
      authProvider={authProvider}
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-     Title={Title}
&lt;/span&gt;      Header={Header}
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-     Sider={Sider}
-     Footer={Footer}
&lt;/span&gt;      Layout={Layout}
      OffLayoutArea={OffLayoutArea}
    &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Resource name="feedbacks" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Refine&amp;gt;
  );
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;export default App;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After adding the resource, our auth provider was activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rMM7ibdT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f33qwilj70oclqwpyx7o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rMM7ibdT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f33qwilj70oclqwpyx7o.png" alt="refine-auth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's create a user on the Strapi to be able to login to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fGIPWLOE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1l6zeabssa31324zczyl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fGIPWLOE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1l6zeabssa31324zczyl.png" alt="create-user"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a user and login to the application with this user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_j0nBEJr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/90jlvt5zbx51v0ihgybo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_j0nBEJr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/90jlvt5zbx51v0ihgybo.png" alt="first-look-refine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's customize the layout component, remove the sider and add a header.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;antd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LayoutProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LayoutProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OffLayoutArea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;minHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;flexDirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;OffLayoutArea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;AntLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's customize the header component too&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;antd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;justifyContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;alignItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;64px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;borderBottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1px solid #f0f0f0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./refeedback.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"refeedback"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;250px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new view, there are no siders anymore and the header we have customized is here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YHMNI2DC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgl3qulg1c3qr62duw0k.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YHMNI2DC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgl3qulg1c3qr62duw0k.png" alt="customized-layout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the part where we can list our feedback and make changes to it. Before that, let's create dummy feedback records on Strapi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1IA_VBWd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vfffwpobkpsxt2dn6sf6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1IA_VBWd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vfffwpobkpsxt2dn6sf6.png" alt="dummy-data-strapi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;FeedbackList.tsx&lt;/code&gt; file under the &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; folder. Then, let's create our component as follows with the components and hooks that come with refine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Typography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AntdList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSimpleList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CrudFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HttpError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Radio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Descriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IFeedback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IFeedbackFilterVariables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FeedBackType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Paragraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Typography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addTagColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FeedBackType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;issue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;idea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FeedbackList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FeedBackType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;created_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IFeedbackFilterVariables&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FeedBackType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We listed our records using the &lt;a href="https://refine.dev/docs/api-references/hooks/show/useSimpleList/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;useSimpleList&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ant.design"&gt;Ant Design&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ant.design/components/list"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;List&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used Antd &lt;a href="https://ant.design/components/form/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; component to filter our records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made it possible to change the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; of our record with &lt;a href="https://refine.dev/docs/api-references/hooks/data/useUpdate"&gt;&lt;code&gt;useUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See detailed usage of useSimpleList for adding new filters, adding search entries, dynamic sorting operations and more &lt;a href="https://refine.dev/docs/api-references/hooks/show/useSimpleList/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ClkvUbQr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/hackathon/refeedback-list-page.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ClkvUbQr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://refine.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/hackathon/refeedback-list-page.gif" alt="refeedback-list"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's develop feedback widget where we can get feedback to expand the application a little more. For this application, I will develop this component with refine, but you can create this component with Strapi APIs in any way you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at the code of the component I developed &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/refeedback/src/components/feedback"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's add this component to the &lt;code&gt;OfflayouArea&lt;/code&gt; component and create feedback on the page and see how it comes to our feedback list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3OV2nMrt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6k0moctaugzaguvya3fs.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3OV2nMrt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6k0moctaugzaguvya3fs.gif" alt="refeedback-widget"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code of the project here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/refeedback"&gt;https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/refeedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;String Builder is a separate class just like String, which allows us to modify the values(mutability).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#need-of-string-builder"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Need of String Builder
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know that Strings  are immutable ,because of which&lt;br&gt;
each and every time we need to create an object and that object will have no reference in later cases while running the loop , hence there will be huge memory wastage and due to this we use String Builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-explanation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Explanation:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a simple code which  demonstrates the use of String Builder class to print all alphabets from a-z, and to show how efficient it is in space and time complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So inside the main function, we create a StringBuilder using "new" keyword, just like how we use to create for Strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now inside the

&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;

loop we take ASCII value of a and add it to the iterating variable

&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;

and finally typecast the ASCII value to a character and assign it to

&lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt;

.
* In next step we add(

&lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt;

) each character to the builder and finally print it after converting them to String format by calling toString() Method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-analysis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Now if we analyze the Time Complexity of using &lt;strong&gt;Strings&lt;/strong&gt; for the above example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[a,ab,abc,abcd,...........,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Size of each items are 1+2+3+4...+26 (N). This can be represented as N(N+1) /2 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eliminating constants and less dominating terms , we finally obtain O(N^2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these large Strings will have no reference variable [Wastage of Space].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### Now if we analyze the Time Complexity of using &lt;strong&gt;String Builder&lt;/strong&gt;  for the above example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here instead of creating new object every time , it makes changes in the exsiting object itself[like how Arrays does], hence saving memory space and time.
For example:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;["abc"+d -&amp;gt; "abcd"]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to this the Time Complexity is O(N).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Migrating a React-Admin Application to refine 💖</title>
      <author>Umut Özdemir</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:54:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pankod/migrating-a-react-admin-application-to-refine-2j6k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pankod/migrating-a-react-admin-application-to-refine-2j6k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://refine.dev/"&gt;refine&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely customizable &lt;a href="https://ant.design/"&gt;Ant Design&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; framework for data-intensive applications and it handles most of the CRUD functionality that can be a requirement in many applications, without much effort. Providing the rest of the desired functionality (outside CRUD) is up to you, like in any &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/"&gt;React-Admin&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing B2B application framework based on &lt;a href="https://material.io/"&gt;Material Design&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href="https://mui.com/"&gt;Material UI&lt;/a&gt;. It provides ready-to-fetch-data components, so you just compose them together to create an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;refine&lt;/strong&gt; is different in the way it makes you compose your application. refine directly provides &lt;strong&gt;Ant Design&lt;/strong&gt; components and some hooks to work with those components. Hooks give you the required props for those Ant Design components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, also, one step forward towards the dream of &lt;strong&gt;making it headless&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about refine, see: &lt;a href="https://refine.dev/docs/getting-started/overview"&gt;https://refine.dev/docs/getting-started/overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, our team decided to migrate a B2B admin panel of one of our customers from &lt;a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/"&gt;React-Admin&lt;/a&gt; to refine to battle test our new framework and improve our productivity. My mission was to migrate it and it took one and a half days for me to rewrite the panel in refine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0lbcRQoR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bfolbjj75vru89afyiml.png" alt="resources menu after migration to refine"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our panel has 7 resources (all listable), which 4 of them must have create and edit pages, 6 of them must be exportable to &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; files and some of those resources have images, all images must be uploaded in &lt;code&gt;base64&lt;/code&gt; format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how it looks before the migration (React-Admin):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SSOzHZze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/icri17tc2vf1cvngco7p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SSOzHZze--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/icri17tc2vf1cvngco7p.png" alt="Admin panel in React-Admin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is how it looks like after the migration (refine): &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3nj4qGM1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5amwrb2ciadtn5vi8pd4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3nj4qGM1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5amwrb2ciadtn5vi8pd4.png" alt="Admin panel in refine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these images show a list page of a resource (campaign).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migrating-listing-pages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migrating Listing Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List pages have one/more tables inside them. Ideally, all table state should be managed by the framework in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;refine is very flexible with tables. You can put them anywhere, configure it as much as you want with &lt;a href="https://refine.dev/docs/api-references/hooks/table/useTable/"&gt;useTable&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href="https://example.refine.dev/categories?current=1&amp;amp;pageSize=10&amp;amp;sort%5B%5D=title&amp;amp;order%5B%5D=asc"&gt;fineFoods example&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine/blob/master/examples/fineFoods/src/pages/categories/list.tsx"&gt;it's code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example list page from React-Admin that shows you the list of &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;isActive&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;startDate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;endDate&lt;/code&gt; from the API endpoint for &lt;code&gt;campaigns&lt;/code&gt; resource.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactAdminList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Datagrid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TextField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BooleanField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;EditButton&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LocalizeDateField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../../fields/LocalizeDateField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ReactAdminList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    );

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is long. Because we had to handle selection and bulk delete button manually. That's because refine is decoupled from Ant Design components' code, too. But the advantage here is that you use Ant Design. You can use the Ant Design's Table as however you like, and then connect its data with refine. The point is customizability. &lt;br&gt;
And it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3nj4qGM1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5amwrb2ciadtn5vi8pd4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3nj4qGM1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5amwrb2ciadtn5vi8pd4.png" alt="Admin panel in refine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In refine, we use Ant Design's &lt;a href="https://ant.design/components/table/"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt; components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migrating-createedit-pages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migrating Create/Edit Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resource creation page's code looked like this in React-Admin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactAdminCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SimpleForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BooleanInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TextInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DateTimeInput&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ReactAdminCreate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;SimpleForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TextInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fullWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"outlined"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;BooleanInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;fullWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"outlined"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"isActive"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Active"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="na"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"startDate"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Start Date"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For refine, code of our campaign create page looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In both refine and React-Admin, by default, there aren't much differences between new resource page's code and resource edit page's code by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that for both refine and React-Admin, this is all customizable. These code examples and screenshots mean little or no extra customization in resource list/create/edit pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantage of refine is that you use Ant Design directly. Let's assume you have your own way around your Ant Design application. refine doesn't interfere. Instead, it provides you the necessary data for your Ant Design application. This way, refine gives you all the freedom to customize all the components as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking with refine 🪄&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build fast and customizable admin panel with NestJS.</title>
      <author>Yıldıray Ünlü</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:33:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pankod/build-fast-and-customizable-admin-panel-with-nestjs-291</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pankod/build-fast-and-customizable-admin-panel-with-nestjs-291</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All the steps described are in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/job-posting-app"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest"&gt;NestJS&lt;/a&gt; is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. With &lt;a href="https://github.com/nestjsx/crud"&gt;nestjsx/crud&lt;/a&gt; we can add CRUD functions quickly and effortlessly on this framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will prepare a simple &lt;code&gt;job-posting&lt;/code&gt; application. We will also use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine"&gt;refine&lt;/a&gt; framework for the &lt;strong&gt;admin panel&lt;/strong&gt;. The project will consist of two parts, api and admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%C2%A0nestjs-rest-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
   NestJS Rest Api
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start playing with NestJS you should have node (&amp;gt;= 10.13.0, except for v13) and &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Project Folder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;job-posting-app
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;job-posting-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Setting up a new project is quite simple with the &lt;a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview"&gt;Nest CLI&lt;/a&gt;. With npm installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @nestjs/cli
nest new api
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm"&gt;TypeORM&lt;/a&gt; is definitely the most mature ORM available in the node.js world. Since it's written in TypeScript, it works pretty well with the Nest framework. I chose mysql as database. TypeORM supports many databases (MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with this library we have to install all required dependencies:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; @nestjs/typeorm @nestjs/config typeorm mysql2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/job-posting-app/blob/master/api/.env.example"&gt;.env.example&lt;/a&gt; file. Here we will save the database information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and configured a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/job-posting-app/blob/master/api/docker-compose.yml"&gt;docker-compose&lt;/a&gt; file for MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/job-posting-app/blob/master/api/ormconfig.ts"&gt;ormconfig.ts&lt;/a&gt; file for migrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following scripts to the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file for migrations.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"typeorm"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js"&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"db:migration:generate"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run typeorm -- migration:generate"&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"db:migration:run"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run typeorm -- migration:run"&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"db:migration:revert"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run typeorm -- migration:revert"&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"db:refresh"&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"npm run typeorm schema:drop &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm run db:migration:run"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import the &lt;code&gt;TypeOrmModule&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install nestjsx-crud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/nestjsx/crud"&gt;nestjsx-crud&lt;/a&gt; library because it makes crud functions easier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i @nestjsx/crud @nestjsx/crud-typeorm class-transformer class-validator
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the steps to create Entities Contorllers, and services are very long, I do not explain step by step. You can check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/job-posting-app"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It created these end-points automatically with nestjsx/crud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_lESZOpk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/opkvo6yvdil0tppfb4fa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_lESZOpk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/opkvo6yvdil0tppfb4fa.png" alt="Swagger"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now let's refine the admin panel.&lt;/strong&gt; With &lt;a href="https://pankod.github.io/superplate/docs"&gt;Superplate&lt;/a&gt;, we can quickly create a &lt;code&gt;refine&lt;/code&gt; project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx superplate-cli admin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Answer as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;✔ Select your project type › refine
✔ What will be the name of your app · admin
✔ Do you want to customize theme?: · less
✔ Data Provider: · nestjsx-crud-data-provider
✔ Auth Provider: · none
✔ Do you want to add an example page? · example-resource
✔ Do you want to customize layout? · custom-layout
✔ i18n - Internationalization: · no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;admin
npm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refine's sample application will welcome you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_JF8D6AZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oz45z207pxe6x4bryvgw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_JF8D6AZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oz45z207pxe6x4bryvgw.png" alt="Refine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change api url in &lt;a href="https://github.com/pankod/refine-hackathon/tree/main/job-posting-app/blob/master/admin/src/App.tsx"&gt;admin/src/App.tsx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const API_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's add the listing page in refine for the &lt;code&gt;companies&lt;/code&gt; crud end-point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;/admin/src/pages/companies/list.tsx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TextField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IResourceComponentsProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDefaultSortOrder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;EditButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DeleteButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TagField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ShowButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@pankod/refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ICompany&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;interfaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CompanyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IResourceComponentsProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tableProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sorter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ICompany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;initialSorter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"location"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"location"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Location"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TextField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Is Active"&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TagField&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="na"&gt;sorter&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;ICompany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          title="Actions"
          dataIndex="actions"
          render=&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;EditButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;hideText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"small"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;recordItemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShowButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;hideText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"small"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;recordItemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;DeleteButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;hideText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"small"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;recordItemId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        /&amp;gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, let's add the create, edit and jobs crud pages under the pages folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's define the resources in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Refine&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (App.tsx):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataProvider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"companies"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CompanyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CompanyCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CompanyEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CompanyShow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;canDelete&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Resource&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"jobs"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JobList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JobCreate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JobEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CompanyShow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;canDelete&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Refine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
