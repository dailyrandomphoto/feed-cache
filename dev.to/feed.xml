      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web Accessibility is a must in every web development project, yet it seems to remain a mystery for many web developers. Like it's something legendary instead of an essential skill needed for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many misconceptions surrounding Web Accessibility, most of the time fueled by a lack of knowledge (or interest) in the matter. This article is a collection of some of those accessibility misconceptions or myths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility is difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility is expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessible websites are ugly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility is for blind people/screen readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility is for people with disabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic tests are enough for accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility overlays are enough to ensure Web Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML is accessible by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No ARIA &amp;gt; Bad ARIA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefers reduced motion means no motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessibility-is-difficult"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessibility is difficult
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often hear this term when a project is at an advanced stage and not accessible. "Accessibility is difficult!" As if it was a justifiable reason because of all the delays they are experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's nothing further from the truth. &lt;strong&gt;Accessibility is not difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what's difficult? Running at an Olympic level. Even more, just running is difficult. A baby needs 12 months to start crawling, walking, and finally running. It's a slow process that requires strengthening the muscles, getting coordination, practice, practice, and more practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CkXxvoaQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ya5i5avoenellymas9xo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CkXxvoaQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ya5i5avoenellymas9xo.png" alt="A young woman and a young man athletes prepare to run in a training hall"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Alt text is difficult? Try running 100m in under 10 seconds (picture: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/young-athletes-preparing-for-running-in-training-hall-3764014/"&gt;
Andrea Piacquadio&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a Web Developer can learn &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the basics of Web Accessibility within hours, practice within days, and have a good grasp within weeks. Of course, they won't be experts. Still, they would be able to fix and prevent many of the issues highlighted in the &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/"&gt;WebAIM Million report&lt;/a&gt; and avoid the main accessibility issues that plague the Internet nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are more things to Web Accessibility than just the basics. Learning and mastering more advanced approaches takes time, but a good enough level is possible within a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessibility-is-expensive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessibility is expensive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it expensive in time? Expensive in money? Both of them? Either way, it is a dubious claim that can be heard towards the end of projects in which they did not consider Web Accessibility at the early stages... which makes it expensive! Teams will have to work on issues after the fact, rebuilding the solution (almost from scratch in some cases), which will waste time and money. Something that they could have avoided if they had implemented accessibility at the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a car and the oil light goes on, you change the oil. It will take you a few minutes, either done by yourself or at the shop, and it will cost you just a few bucks. However, if you don't change the oil, chances are that your engine will seize up and break down after a while. The repair will be in the hundreds (or thousands) of dollars, and it will require a mechanic using special tools and parts. Not to mention that the car will be off-service for days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rBSwslqs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d9htrxkmdirxbj3g2kl1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rBSwslqs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d9htrxkmdirxbj3g2kl1.jpg" alt="A car with the hood up while a man looks inside"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Don't blame the car! You drove with the oil light on for 50 miles! (picture: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/repairing-a-car-6078/"&gt;
Kaboompics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you apply Web Accessibility at the right time (at the start of a project), it will cost less in the long run and save many headaches and stress to the team&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you wait to do it until you have to (e.g., after users complain or you get a lawsuit), then it will be expensive and painful. In addition, it will require specialists and be time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking into consideration that &lt;a href="https://www.ruhglobal.com/disability-influences-trillion-dollars-david-perez/"&gt;people with disabilities have a purchasing power of 1.3 trillion dollars&lt;/a&gt; (over &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2701645/8-trillion-reasons-to-make-your-technology-accessible.html"&gt;8 trillion including relatives and friends&lt;/a&gt;), maybe it's time to stop talking about Web accessibility as an expensive feature, and start presenting it as a profitable one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessible-websites-are-ugly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessible websites are ugly
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing could be further from the truth. Accessibility doesn't determine if a website is ugly or not. There are beautiful, accessible websites and really ugly non-accessible websites. Accessible websites will be as ugly (or as beautiful) as they are designed to be. Like any other website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This myth has gone a long way. It has existed since Web Accessibility is a thing (which means, basically since the beginning of the Internet) and it is rooted in a misconception. Before, the idea of accessibility was linked to no styles, no animations, no images, no videos... no nothing. A bland, dull, ugly site. But that doesn't have to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the accessibility requirements will indeed limit the creativity of designers and developers (e.g., sometimes finding an accessible color palette can be a challenge), but there are many tools online that will help with that. Plus, the different standards have evolved to include many accessibility features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to ditch the idea of building a website and then uglifying it to make it accessible. That's an old-school mentality. Accessible websites can be visually striking, animated, fun, interactive sites from the start. And good designers are doing a great job at infusing inclusiveness and accessibility out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessibility-is-for-blind-peoplescreen-readers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessibility is for blind people/screen readers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the most popular assistive technologies being focused on people with visual disabilities, it is &lt;em&gt;tempting&lt;/em&gt; to think that accessibility is mainly for blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's more to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deaf or deaf-blind people,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People using automatic page-turners, adaptive pencil grips, or assistive pointer devices,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with vestibular disorders,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard users, braille devices users, sip-and-puff device users, to name a few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who require Web Accessibility are not a homogeneous group. Therefore, we cannot apply a one-size-fits-all type of solution and move forward with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the online controversy that happened not so long ago as an example: a blind person organized a ClubHouse meeting about Web Accessibility. Soon, he got some backlash from the Deaf community as ClubHouse is a notoriously inaccessible platform, and the gathering excluded people with hearing problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it really possible to talk about accessibility while focusing only on visual disabilities? Without including all people involved? The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessibility-is-for-people-with-disabilities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessibility is for people with disabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This myth is a variation of the above. We already made clear that accessibility is not only for blind people, but we must not think it only impacts people with disabilities. It actually affects everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://userway.org/blog/how-situational-disabilities-impact-us-all"&gt;invisible and situation disabilities&lt;/a&gt; that impair people and limit what they can do temporarily (or even permanently). You may...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...break a bone while playing basketball and be unable to use the mouse/keyboard on your computer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...be pregnant or have restless children that don't let you sleep at night, and then have sleep deprivation that doesn't let you focus during the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...get an ear infection that baffles the sounds and prevents you from hearing your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...have common migraines that cause you to have "clouded vision" and short attention spans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are surrounded by examples like these. Every day. Everywhere. Pay attention, and you will start noticing them more and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--39z0wnUj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/37uliedl4sylfq00311m.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--39z0wnUj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/37uliedl4sylfq00311m.jpg" alt="Photography showing different runners in a race. One of them is in a wheelchair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
If I said 3 of these people had disabilities. Could you tell who? (picture: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/group-of-men-running-on-streets-2403057/"&gt;
RUN 4 FFWPU&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;Some people may think now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are disabilities! Also, that's great... but that's not me. I have never broken a bone, and I don't plan on having kids, and I have loud ringtones... Oh, and I will stay young forever, too. So Web Accessibility doesn't apply to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great confidence there, but that's wrong. Even if you are a fully healthy individual, you may find yourself in situations where Web Accessibility will help you. For example, using your laptop outside and the reflection doesn't let you read, wouldn't you want more contrast? Camping in the forest and the key images for the "what to do when a snake bites you?" article timeout or don't load correctly, wouldn't you want an alternative text that would help you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more examples like that: people in remote areas with low connection, people with not state-of-the-art computers and phones, granny asking you for help because the text is too small to read... Don't underestimate the reach of Web Accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#automatic-tests-are-enough-for-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Automatic tests are enough for accessibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated testing for accessibility is possible and highly recommended. But it is not a replacement for manual testing: automatic tests only &lt;a href="https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/index.html"&gt;detect ~30% of the issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we can simulate a user's behavior with the keyboard and tab, check for color contrast, or a specific HTML structure, there are still tests that we cannot automate and behaviors that we cannot simulate. Thus, limiting the capacity of what automated tests can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that we should drop automatic accessibility tests. On the contrary, we should embrace them and use them in all our projects. It is important to remember that they complement and not replace good old manual testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overlays-are-enough-to-ensure-web-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overlays are enough to ensure Web Accessibility
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more a misconception among executives and people who make decisions about buying these types of solutions. The consensus in the Accessibility community is almost unanimous: overlays don't work. &lt;a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/"&gt;None of them fully work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overlay is an automated technology aimed at improving the accessibility of a website. It may come in many flavors: plug-ins, add-on libraries, toolbars, widgets... but their functionality is similar: modify the page's source code on the fly and repair the non-accessible code, replacing it with an accessible version. Something really tempting at an affordable price and with just a single line of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One line of JavaScript does not make a website 100% accessible. In some cases, the results may even be damaging. And all for just a little benefit, as people with disabilities already use tools that fix many of the issues that the overlays claim to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in a previous section, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for Web Accessibility. And that's exactly what overlays try to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things may change. While accessibility overlays may not be enough to ensure Web Accessibility at the moment, with the advances in AI and machine learning, they might become an alternative in the future. But currently, they aren't a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#html-is-accessible-by-default"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HTML is accessible by default
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've heard many times developers say, "&lt;em&gt;HTML is accessible out of the box&lt;/em&gt;," almost as if the definition of HTML in the dictionary was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Accessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is not always the case. There are HTML elements that are not accessible by themselves or may present challenges to the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, elements like &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Multimedia"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; have controls that are not fully keyboard-accessible&lt;/a&gt; and that differ considerably from browser to browser and cause frustration. Or the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element has many types that open pop-ups, which may not be accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many components and structures that are not native HTML elements (e.g., tab panels), and once we start combining HTML, accessibility issues may pop up from the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of HTML in that imaginary Hitchhiker's Guide to the (Web) Galaxy should be updated to something more appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mostly accessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That looks much better, and it is definitely more accurate to reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#no-aria-gt-bad-aria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  No ARIA &amp;gt; Bad ARIA
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before all accessibility experts start crying foul and cursing my name, let me clarify something: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No ARIA is better than bad ARIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. ARIA is not supported by all browsers/screen readers, and it should be a last resort. The way to go should be using semantic HTML when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, using semantic HTML is not always possible and not enough to cover all the cases needed for a good experience. For example, there are widgets and patterns (e.g., tab panels again) that cannot be done using semantic elements and, in those cases, ARIA is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The myth/misconception of "No ARIA &amp;gt; Bad ARIA" is that it leaves out an important part of the equation: where does "Good ARIA" go? And the answer is actually quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good ARIA &amp;gt; No ARIA &amp;gt; Bad ARIA&lt;br&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can all agree that bad ARIA is bad. But no ARIA isn't ideal either: the solution to providing a bad experience (bad ARIA) should not be providing a subpar experience (no ARIA). There should be a good experience too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a kid is learning to ride a bike and struggles and falls, we don't tell them, "stop! don't ever ride a bike!" Instead, we teach them. We encourage them to keep learning and trying... until they can do it by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0eNMsZYY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jpmvqtmo6xqptfgnk8cg.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0eNMsZYY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jpmvqtmo6xqptfgnk8cg.jpeg" alt="A little kid pushes a bicycle with the help of an adult"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Sorry, Timmy. You fell once. No point on trying again. (picture: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/full-body-of-father-and-child-in-protective-helmet-pushing-bike-along-road-3932890/"&gt;
Tatiana Syrikova&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;"No ARIA &amp;gt; bad ARIA" perpetuates a false dichotomy. There's good ARIA, too. And we can learn ARIA, practice ARIA, improve ARIA... We won't be good at the beginning, but we will get better and provide a better experience with time and practice than with no ARIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prefers-reduced-motion-means-no-motion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prefers reduced motion means no motion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more of developers' good intentions based on a misconception. We (myself included) found an option to reduce motion, and we "brute-force" our way through it, cancelling all transitions and animations like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;*,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;!important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;!important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not everything is black or white. There are many shades of grey, and not all animations and transitions are bad. &lt;a href="https://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/"&gt;Some of them are worse than others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't need to cancel every motion on a website. Instead, we need to think through them, check what's appropriate and not, and provide an expanded/animated experience for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In An Event Apart, &lt;a href="https://aneventapart.com/news/post/making-motion-inclusive-aea-video"&gt;Val Head had a great presentation about accessibility and animation&lt;/a&gt;. In the video, she explains different animations and transitions and which ones are better when trying to avoid triggering a negative reaction: color changes, opacity fades, small movements...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, related to this myth, reduced motion applies to more than just animations and transitions: background videos, animated GIFs, or scroll behavior are examples of things that need changes when the user opted for reduced motion. So let's not forget them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Started With Angular Material</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers are using Angular Material in their Angular applications. But what is the best way to add the library, and why do you want to use &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular Material is an Angular Component library build and maintained by Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a component library filled with a ton of easy to use Angular components. The library includes components like a &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/components/datepicker/overview"&gt;datepicker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/components/input/overview"&gt;input elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/components/slide-toggle/overview"&gt;toggle switches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview"&gt;tables&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/components/categories"&gt;a lot more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components support customization in various ways. You can use their pre-built themes or build your own with the custom color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" alt="divider-byrayray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-angular-material"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Use Angular Material?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular Material is updated simultaneously with Angular, which is one of the best advantages of using Angular Material and not other component libraries. Every time Google brings a new update for Angular, it will update Angular Material simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you update your Angular application with &lt;code&gt;ng update&lt;/code&gt;, it will also update Angular Material simultaneously, which is pretty handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Angular Material, you know for sure, as long as Google keeps developing Angular, it will stay Angular Material up-to-date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the components have been tested for a long time. I've been an Angular Material user for a long time, but I've never had an actual error in an Angular Material component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you don't like the style of Angular Material, you can also change their styling. Picking another Angular component library is an excellent alternative if you want something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" alt="divider-byrayray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-add-angular-material"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How To Add Angular Material?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before installing Angular Material in an existing project, we have to make sure you installed the Angular CLI. If you haven't, run this command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; @angular/cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's start with installing Angular Material in an existing project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng add @angular/material
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When you perform the command above, you will get a few configuration options to choose from. Make the choice you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this process, you can use Angular Material in your Angular project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" alt="divider-byrayray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-angular-material"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How To Use Angular Material?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular Material components can be used by importing the module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want to use the &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/components/checkbox/overview"&gt;checkbox component&lt;/a&gt;, you have to import the following module in the &lt;code&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt; if you're going to use it in all the components across the entire application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MatCheckboxModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/material/checkbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This code can be found on every component page in the API tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can go to a component where you want to use your imported component. Check the examples tab for an example of the components and code sample's on how to use the component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;mat-checkbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"example-margin"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[(ngModel)]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"checked"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Checked&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/mat-checkbox&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" alt="divider-byrayray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-load-all-angular-material-components-at-once"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How To Load All Angular Material Components At Once
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no default way to load all Angular Material component modules at once. I think there is a good reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create an Angular Module to import all the Angular Material modules and import that module in your &lt;code&gt;app.module.ts&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, are you going to use all the Angular Material components in your application? I don't think so because you're going to waste a whole lot of data that the user needs to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's wiser to load the module of the Angular Material component in the Angular Module where you need it. And not load them all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you want to do it, check out this &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/pimatco/d5b1891feb90b60ca4681011b6513873"&gt;Gist on Github&lt;/a&gt; which has all the available Angular Material modules for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular Material offers a great set of well-tested and configurable Angular components. The most significant benefit is, it's developed simultaneously by the Angular team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forwards to see all the projects you build with Angular Material!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K5DfBJtN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1629890886208/NhHYvPmBA.png" alt="divider-byrayray.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GitHub Workflow,  Merge and Rebase</title>
      <author>AaronDski</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 19:16:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aarondski/github-workflow-merge-and-rebase-1cig</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aarondski/github-workflow-merge-and-rebase-1cig</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are just getting into coding and are working on projects, ether solo or in a group, you probably use GitHub, a platform to house your projects. Or you use it at your job and are always doing adds and commits, waiting for you superior to approve the merge. If you already know how all of that works, then you most likely won't need to read this post. I am writing this as more of a quick reference guide for us newbies... and there is a lot of additional good documentation from GitHub and lots of extra resources on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 major ways to update a main/master branch in GitHub: the first is the good old &lt;code&gt;git merge&lt;/code&gt;, and the second is &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt;. Both of these commands accomplish the same thing: they update the main/master branch with your newly written code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is coming from the view point that you are working on a branch that is not the main. Make sure you have the most up-to-date version of the main repository by running &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;. To make your own branch, you can run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch 
#this will display all of the branches in the current repo
git branch example_branch
#this will make a branch off the main if you are currently on the main branch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we need to get into the new branch we just made. We can do this with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout example_branch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you have been working on a feature for the main code file; let's talk about when you are ready to have your code reviewed and potentially merged into the main branch. First we check the status to make sure we only edited the files we were supposed to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we add all of our changes to the staging area to be committed by running one of the following commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git add -A
git add 'file name'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now your code is ready for a commit. This is where we are able to leave a detailed message about what we did with our code. Here are some commit commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -m "message"
git commit -am "message"
#This command will add your changes and commit them in one go
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then once you have your code committed, you can push your code to the origin branch with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally it is ready to be reviewed and sent back for editing, or it can be merged into the main. If there is no more code for you to add, when your branch and the main branch are merged, you have the option to delete your branch. If you will need to use it again soon, then you can just leave it be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To merge to 2 branches, we will want to go into the main/master branch, then run &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, just in case there have been any changes (it will let you know if you are up to date, or it will automatically load the changes). Our commands can look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#currently not on main branch

git checkout main
#now we are on the main branch

git pull
# just to double check for any changes

git merge example_branch   
#now the branch has been merged into main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hopefully there are no merge conflicts, and if not, you are done! That is the easy way to do a merge and its called a "fast forward merge."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do get some merge conflicts you will need to resolve those conflicts before you can move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A merge is pretty self explanatory, you are combining the contents of 2 items into 1.  There are a few ways that a merge can happen, 1) you can do it strait in your terminal, 2) you can use the GitHub webpage, 3) Github also has an app for OSX that works pretty well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5MP3twR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/53brudbvuzzlixtlx6bd.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5MP3twR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/53brudbvuzzlixtlx6bd.jpeg" alt="Merge Sign"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there are commits on the main branch that are added after you made your branch, it will prompt what is called a "merge commit," once the merge is initiated. You can leave a message and move on to write more code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UpNTGv_F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/htznp8biw1ckvwyv67y5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UpNTGv_F--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/htznp8biw1ckvwyv67y5.jpg" alt="Merge commit image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A merge commit will have a lot of "~" symbols and you need to leave a message to move forward in the commit, it would look like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~
~
~
~
~
~
~
~
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can hit the &lt;em&gt;escape&lt;/em&gt; key, then type &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: w q&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which will save the commit and get you through the merge commit. Then you should double check with &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; to make sure all the commit history looks correct to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Rebase" is a git command that will get us a similar result of adding our code to the main branch, but it works very differently. Rather than having branches come together into the main, you are basically adding your 'example_branch' onto the end of the master branch. To do this you follow all of the same steps above, but when it comes time to merge, you will instead run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#you will want to be in your "example_branch" when you run this command

git rebase main/master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to THINK Days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weekly blog series where I discuss and share my journey with IBM Cloud Services. At some point most of us have come across containers and images that we have managed on our own DockerHub. And running a few containers on your own is fine, but what do you do when you're running hundreds or thousands? That's where you need a container orchestration and that's precisely where Kubernetes comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-kubernetes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Kubernetes?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is an open source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF). It's around seven years young, has thousands of commits, and is a vibrant, well-supported&lt;br&gt;
open source ecosystem with many vendors contributing to the project from IBM to Google to Microsoft to Amazon (you get this gist). In fact, there are over 150 certified Kubernetes providers on the market today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Kubernetes is to make everything associated with deploying and managing your containers easier. This means it has automated rollouts and rollbacks which will scale your services up or down based on utilization. This ensures that you're only running what you need when you need it. It will monitor the health of your services to prevent bad roll outs. They will also continuously run health checks against your services and thereby restart containers that fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Kubernetes is built to be used anywhere, allowing you to orchestrate deployments to public clouds, private clouds, on premise, or even hybrid cloud deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kubernetes-high-level-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kubernetes High Level Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common way that a System Administrator would interact with Kubernetes is through the &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; CLI. This acts as the communication between System Admin and a specific Kubernetes Cluster.&lt;br&gt;
The natural question is what is a cluster and how does that relate to my containerized images? Well, each cluster will have a master node and at least one worker node. Each worker node can support running multiple pods. Each pod is intern running an image of a containerized application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ibm-cloud-kubernetes-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM Cloud offers a fully managed Kubernetes service in a matter of minutes called IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or IKS. You can spin up your own Kubernetes cluster, have access to worker nodes, and start deploying applications. IBM Cloud's Kubernetes service has many benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully managed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides automatic upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Compliance (PCI ,HIPAA, SOC1, and more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configure as a single or multi zone cluster
IKS also has several supported add-on benefits:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a service mesh or serverless onto your cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's dive a little deeper...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IKS can be deployed to any of the six regions on IBM Cloud. This includes North America, East, West, South, the APAC Region, Europe and South America.&lt;br&gt;
There are different ways to deploy IBM Cloud Kubernetes service. The first is on a virtual shared instance. This will provision IKS on virtual machines.&lt;br&gt;
Next is a virtual dedicated instance which is going to provision your cluster on a dedicated server. Note, that this is a single tenant instance. &lt;br&gt;
Lastly, you can provision your Kubernetes cluster on a bare metal server.&lt;br&gt;
Each type of deployment has multiple profiles ranging from 2vCPU to 512 gigabytes of RAM. The billing for IKS is hourly, monthly or even has a LITE option which is free for one cluster upto a certain limit.&lt;br&gt;
There are two other services worth highlighting when discussing IKS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ibm-cloud-container-registry"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IBM Cloud Container Registry
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the IBM Cloud Container Registry which is used to store container images in a fully managed multi-tenant registry. It's highly available as the service is hosted and managed by IBM Cloud. You can configure your images to be privately accessed by other users in your IBM Cloud&lt;br&gt;
account shareable with API keys or even make them publicly available. Images in the container registry will also be scanned by the vulnerability advisor tool which makes it secure. If you would like a tutorial on this service, be sure to checkout my blog to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ibmdeveloper/deploy-a-nodejs-app-to-ibm-cloud-container-registry-46m2"&gt;Deploy a NodeJS app to IBM Cloud Container Registry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#helm-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Helm Catalog
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other service is the Helm Catalog which is unique to IBM Cloud. It allows users to use helm to install and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications in a cluster. The helm catalog in IBM Cloud has access to IBM products, popular open source products, like Jenkins and Tecton, and supports multiple architectures like X86 power NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have dived into the features and availabilities on IBM Cloud Kubernetes service let's take a look at how to deploy an app onto this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tutorial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tutorial
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-free-kubernetes-cluster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a free Kubernetes cluster
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href="https://cloud.ibm.com"&gt;https://cloud.ibm.com&lt;/a&gt; to log into IBM Cloud. You'll be presented with an empty console. Click on the Catalog button on the top-right.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DQnTXgpb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9boltuxpzobfy141kq6k.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DQnTXgpb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9boltuxpzobfy141kq6k.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.01.19 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the catalog, choose the Kubernetes option.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PR2TfzEy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ubdr7tcywpkkujgpn8x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PR2TfzEy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4ubdr7tcywpkkujgpn8x.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.02.59 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the Free tier option, give your cluster a unique name and click Create.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DvLGk5LY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gictbbb27cysq23joyoj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DvLGk5LY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gictbbb27cysq23joyoj.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.04.03 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#launch-the-ibm-cloud-shell"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Launch the IBM Cloud Shell
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your cluster is created click on the &lt;code&gt;Actions&lt;/code&gt; menu on the top right, and choose the &lt;code&gt;Connect via CLI&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eteCIbr3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/89mar7jof58ho9jaweyl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eteCIbr3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/89mar7jof58ho9jaweyl.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.05.50 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the clipboard to copy the command, the one using the ibmcloud ks cluster config command. This will set any kubectl commands to use your newly created cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jcWGhip4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hl00y7oobmwsyt1zka4m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jcWGhip4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hl00y7oobmwsyt1zka4m.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.29.38 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we'll be using the IBM Cloud Shell, which is available by clicking on the terminal icon on the top right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B8lH8Ig0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1d8u3i7idhfqc9i9oytm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B8lH8Ig0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1d8u3i7idhfqc9i9oytm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.38.13 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once loaded, you'll be presented with an embedded web terminal that has the &lt;code&gt;ibmcloud&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; CLIs available.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BCUGv6A6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oncxrg18cpjol7rgwaxj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BCUGv6A6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oncxrg18cpjol7rgwaxj.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.39.52 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connect-to-your-cluster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connect to your cluster
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the IBM Cloud Shell, run the following command, replacing your cluster ID in the command below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster &amp;lt;CLUSTER_ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output should look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rkv7-euV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vn5bci86wy4hnh7rkuxg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rkv7-euV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vn5bci86wy4hnh7rkuxg.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.41.25 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-the-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploy the application
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this tutorial, we'll run a sample IBM Sample App that detects objects in a picture. Deploy the application by running the command below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/MAX-Object-Detector/master/max-object-detector.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XASpV1_y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ldb0wrjj6wvdc804vjmk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XASpV1_y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ldb0wrjj6wvdc804vjmk.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.43.03 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#access-the-app-via-public-ip-and-port"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Access the App via Public IP and Port
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, the application should be available. To access it we need to find the public IP address of the cluster, and the port the application is running on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the public IP address of the cluster run the command below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibmcloud cs workers --cluster &amp;lt;CLUSTER_ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And to find the port the application is running on, run the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl describe service max-object-detector | grep NodePort
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's finally put it all together and access the app. From your browser navigate to the URL with the information above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;public-ip-address:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;/app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--htLPxfd7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ijnj8kxfmtwvurlpw7v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--htLPxfd7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ijnj8kxfmtwvurlpw7v.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-10 at 2.50.55 PM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oila! You have successfully deployed an app onto a cluster in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Seed Data Fast with the Faker Gem ⚡️🏃🏻💨</title>
      <author>Maxine Meurer</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:38:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mmeurer00/seed-data-fast-with-the-faker-gem-nej</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mmeurer00/seed-data-fast-with-the-faker-gem-nej</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table Of Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#2"&gt;What is Faker?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#3"&gt;Installation &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#4"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are you're here because you saw the word combination &lt;em&gt;Seed Data Fast&lt;/em&gt;, and I don't blame you! Creating a database is enough work itself, so coming up with custom seed data can become an unnecessary and time-consuming task. But all thanks to the Ruby &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker"&gt;Faker gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, seeding data can be done in a &lt;strong&gt;quick&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;easy&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt; way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-faker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Faker? &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faker is a Ruby gem written by Jason Kohles. Like many of us, Jason got sick of spending time writing out seed data, so he made a gem to make all of our lives easier. &lt;em&gt;Thanks, Jason!&lt;/em&gt; Faker comes with a handful of generators that allow you to generate fake data such as names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, Twitter posts, job titles, and more! There are also methods available to provide you with &lt;a href="https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker#ensuring-unique-values"&gt;unique data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a Ruby Gem and will only work for Ruby applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, install the Ruby Faker Gem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install faker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the gem has successfully installed, head over to the &lt;code&gt;seeds.rb&lt;/code&gt; file, and require the gem at the top of the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'faker'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You're ready to go, all there's left to do is... &lt;em&gt;Seed&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;seeds.rb&lt;/code&gt; file, go ahead and write a small script using the Faker gem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# generate 10 users&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Faker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Esport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;player&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Faker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;profession&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Faker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Faker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Faker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;full_address&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Faker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;PhoneNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;cell_phone&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;username: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;email: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;profession: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;profession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;address: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;phone: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you've created a beautiful script containing all your lovely data, seed it! In your terminal run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails db:seed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can check everything was seeded correctly by confirming your data is present within the rails console, or if you have your server up and running, you can check your routes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If no seed data shows up, see that you are meeting all validations in your model that may be prohibiting the data from being created in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it! ✨&lt;em&gt;Data&lt;/em&gt;✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to create data that there are not necessarily generators for, get creative with ones that already exist! As you can see in the example script provided above, there was no username generator, so the Esport generator with the &lt;code&gt;.player&lt;/code&gt; method was used instead. Most of the generators provide multiple methods for various types of, as well as unique data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating seed data can be a tedious task, but it doesn't have to be! The Faker gem is fantastic for fast, simple, and sometimes funny seed data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any alternative ways/gems to seed data, feel free to share them below! Happy Seeding! 🌱  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developer Diaries: Week 4 - The exploding brain</title>
      <author>Brittany Joiner</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:34:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/brittany_join/developer-diaries-week-4-the-exploding-brain-23ph</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/brittany_join/developer-diaries-week-4-the-exploding-brain-23ph</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a week! Let's dive right in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#imposter-syndrome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Imposter Syndrome
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; part of this week. I was getting a little discouraged because I had a PR that it just seemed no matter what I did on it, it wasn't good enough. And I 💯% know it's because I have a team that wants to push me and help me be the best version I can be, but man sometimes it's just a little deflating when you can't get something quite right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had &lt;strong&gt;over 74 comments on it and 9 commits&lt;/strong&gt; before it was finally ready to go. And with each commit, I'd be like, okay this is perfect now, right? And it wasn't. 😭 I was like &lt;em&gt;"Do I even know what I'm doing? Should I be here if I can't write code well yet?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly, when I look at where it started vs where it ended, I could tell it was totally worth it, and I learned a lot along the way. Everyone was very patient with me and there was zero shaming for my lack of knowledge or anything like that - it was definitely a "let's do this better together" type of thing, and I was extremely grateful for it in the end, but in the process, I felt a little deflated at having to keep on trying and not getting it quite perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually found Reddit to be a nice space to vent for a bit and got a ton of encouragement on this post. So if you're having down days, that's totally normal. There's no such thing as perfect code, and more feedback is totally normal and helps you grow. Reach out to your folks and #TrustTheProcess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learning-how-to-test-with-jest"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learning How To Test with Jest
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of my Really Long PR (as it will henceforth be named) involved a request for setting up test. This is great, but I had never set up a test before, and it proved to be a little challenging - not just for me, but also another senior dev who was helping me! I was honestly a little encouraged that it wasn't a cut and dry, super simple thing for him either, but together we were able to figure it out, and I actually started added tests to my other PR that I had out, as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm going to try to start incorporating more of that to practice. I found Google a little frustrating here, because I'd be like "how do i x with Jest and Enzyme" and i saw all sorts of answers, and honestly, a lot of them didn't work at all. It was super strange. But with some patience and tweaking I was able to get it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#standup-improvements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Standup Improvements
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We currently do standups on M/W/F, but we're contemplating moving those 15 minute meetings to T/TR, and on the other days do an "asynchronous" standup. To do that, we are evaluating if we want to just create a Slackbot reminder message in our channel, or if we want to involve a more formal Standup Bot tool, like &lt;a href="https://geekbot.com/"&gt;Geekbot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to check into the standup bot tools, and I think Geekbot is actually pretty cool. Sends users a DM with questions, and then compiles those answers in a standup report in the channel. I had some fun while I was testing it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P6jQz0ji--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627656787232/KYOBPxkTX.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P6jQz0ji--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627656787232/KYOBPxkTX.png" alt="image (15).png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week! 👋&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Top-10 reasons you should attend CascadiaJS 2021</title>
      <author>CascadiaJS Staff</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:29:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cascadiajs_staff/the-top-10-reasons-you-should-attend-cascadiajs-2021-3nlc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cascadiajs_staff/the-top-10-reasons-you-should-attend-cascadiajs-2021-3nlc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year's CascadiaJS is going to be so big and so awesome, it's hard to fit everything that we're putting together for you into a single tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here's a quick Top-10 list of why this year's event is going to be our best one yet. Don't miss out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-the-speakers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. The speakers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/speakers"&gt;speaker lineup&lt;/a&gt; is just out of this world Ringed planet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From #web3 to #ML to #OpenSource to #a11y, there are talks for every kind of web developer and every stage in their career. And all in a single track, so you won't miss anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-an-awesome-virtual-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. An awesome virtual experience
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For folks who don't live in Cascadia or prefer to stay at home, we are shipping the same, &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/conf"&gt;amazing virtual experience&lt;/a&gt; that we shipped last year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📺 Live streamed talks&lt;br&gt;
🤝 Networking activities&lt;br&gt;
🎉 Virtual parties &amp;amp; trivia &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-inperson-options"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. In-person options
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year's conference is the 1st to feature &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/conf/hybrid"&gt;3 simultaneous in-person events&lt;/a&gt; in the major cities of Cascadia: Seattle, Portland and Vancouver BC Flag of United StatesFlag of Canada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can attend CascadiaJS from the comfort of your own city (and your own bed)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-an-epic-goodie-box-shipped-to-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. An epic Goodie Box shipped to you!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every attendee who registers before &lt;code&gt;Sept 17&lt;/code&gt;, we are shipping them their own Goodie Box that will include a conference hoodie plus a bunch of other awesome goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built a &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/hoodie-fit-guide"&gt;fit guide&lt;/a&gt; this year because people come in all shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-scholarships"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Scholarships
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/scholarships"&gt;Opportunity Scholarship program&lt;/a&gt; for folks who belong to under-represented groups or have issues purchasing tickets at full price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, so far, it's been funded by &lt;em&gt;our community&lt;/em&gt; to the tune of $1360.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-a-hack-day"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. A Hack Day
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hosting our first ever &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/hackday"&gt;Hack Day&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks from &lt;a href="http://battlesnake.com"&gt;Battlesnake&lt;/a&gt; are going to help us run the CascadiaJS Cup where developers code their very own BattleSnake and pit them against each other in 2 dimensional combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-central-venues-for-the-inperson-daytime-events"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Central venues for the in-person daytime events
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venues in Seattle, Portland and Vancouver BC for the daytime events are going to be EPIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've announced UBC Robson Square in Vancouver, and are on the cusp of making big announcements for SEA and PDX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-epic-nighttime-after-parties"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Epic night-time after parties
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night-time Opening and Closing in-person after parties are going to be 🔥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the daytime events, these events will be 100% private and will require everyone to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're still working on the details, but the probability of karaoke 🎤 is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-postconference-workshops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Post-conference workshops
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the conference is an ENTIRE WEEK of &lt;a href="https://2021.cascadiajs.com/workshops"&gt;world-class programming workshops&lt;/a&gt; being hosted by &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/eveporcello"&gt;@eveporcello&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/blove"&gt;@blove&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/marcysutton"&gt;@marcysutton&lt;/a&gt;
 and Ben Ilegbodu 👀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are covering everything from #javascript to #a11y to #performance to #graphql and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-the-community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. The community
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last reason to attend CascadiaJS is because you'll be joining a kind of inclusive community of web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find a new job, you'll probably learn some new skills, but we KNOW you'll make some great friends Growing heart&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to create Pure CSS Glitch Animation 🤖 for Images and SVG</title>
      <author>Roden</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:08:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kerthin/how-to-create-pure-css-glitch-animation-for-images-and-svg-ojl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kerthin/how-to-create-pure-css-glitch-animation-for-images-and-svg-ojl</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I made a post about how to make a Glitch Effect on pure CSS. But in that post I told you how to make a similar effect only for text. Today I want to tell you about how to implement such animation for images and SVG.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/kerthin" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MEDW7r1U--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_Cn4rKT--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/634154/b6864fc7-4410-46ca-a11d-bc605dc6d2b1.jpeg" alt="kerthin"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/kerthin/how-create-pure-css-glitch-effect-530p" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;How to create Glitch Effect 🤖 Pure CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Roden ・ Aug 20 ・ 4 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#webdev&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#beginners&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#tutorial&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#css&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Demo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/RodenKerthin/embed/GYvKOg?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Images&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in fact, everything is very simple. Almost the same technology as with text animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating our block with a picture:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;CSS (SCSS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; We set styles for it (size and picture)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//rawcdn.githack.com/Kerthin/links/247cc9065bac7d5c23b45ff677bf1d2bceeb4324/img/glitch/imgTV/vanille.png);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanilla Image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o8CwRoOx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44wtq7djnm5bicitik53.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o8CwRoOx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44wtq7djnm5bicitik53.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; We create 2 copies of ours in the form of pseudo-elements using &lt;code&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;absolute positioning&lt;/code&gt; so that they are placed one after the other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; After that, for each pseudo-element, we create our own &lt;code&gt;horizontal margins&lt;/code&gt; from the original coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to specify our own image for each pseudo-element, which is a modified original image using allow filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;:before&lt;/code&gt; bg-image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UPwsJial--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/309l3gw0jdp38xt2dwcm.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UPwsJial--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/309l3gw0jdp38xt2dwcm.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;:after&lt;/code&gt; bg-image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3axVrjtn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nh935yk3uvxwmesvbdml.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3axVrjtn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nh935yk3uvxwmesvbdml.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we also need to add the name of our &lt;code&gt;@keyframes&lt;/code&gt; animation to each pseudo-element that we will animate using the &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alternate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//rawcdn.githack.com/Kerthin/links/247cc9065bac7d5c23b45ff677bf1d2bceeb4324/img/glitch/imgTV/red.jpg);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alternate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//rawcdn.githack.com/Kerthin/links/247cc9065bac7d5c23b45ff677bf1d2bceeb4324/img/glitch/imgTV/blue.jpg);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; And now we can just use our &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; animation, which we used in the &lt;code&gt;previous post&lt;/code&gt; about Glitch Animation for text. But only in the value of the &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; property, we must specify the size of our &lt;code&gt;.img&lt;/code&gt; element in &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; (see item &lt;code&gt;№1&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;percentage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))}{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0WtIXy3X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/qrHcza2uMPzk78geJm/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761182595601f16b39d23a7016efaa64ec2f0741c534%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0WtIXy3X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/qrHcza2uMPzk78geJm/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761182595601f16b39d23a7016efaa64ec2f0741c534%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SVG&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the idea is approximately exactly the same, only here it will be more convenient for us not to work with pseudo-elements, but simply to create 3 identical svg elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We create a common container and put 3 copies of our SVG in it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;svgWrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;svgWrap__text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xlink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#svgGlitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;svgWrap__text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xlink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#svgGlitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;svgWrap__text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;xlink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#svgGlitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;#svgGlitch&lt;/code&gt;, we refer to our prepared &lt;code&gt;SVG template&lt;/code&gt;, so as not to copy the entire SVG code 3 times in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SVG Template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;CSS (SCSS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; First, we need to specify the dimensions of our container and each SVG block separately. It is better to put the original sizes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;svgWrap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;270&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;svgWrap__text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;270&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Further, by analogy with the pictures, we set separate styles for each element. But this time instead of pseudo elements :before and :after, we will use :nth-child to access each child element separately.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fffafa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alternate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;f5f5f5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alternate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of SVG, we do not specify different images, but different colors using the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; We animate according to the same principle: as with images. We specify the desired &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of the elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;$steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;glitch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The End&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's it. Some of you may have a question, why not just specify all these possibilities for creating Glitch animations in the previous post, if all these soposoby differ little from each other? Or why not just supplement the previous post with this information? I will answer honestly, I was too lazy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7_AgrGkG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/PPi5c8l8WDY7if1L8z/giphy-downsized-large.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47txrxtvkhyjvnkbwevfw7k8qrnuw9w237sgvrvq14%26rid%3Dgiphy-downsized-large.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7_AgrGkG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/PPi5c8l8WDY7if1L8z/giphy-downsized-large.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47txrxtvkhyjvnkbwevfw7k8qrnuw9w237sgvrvq14%26rid%3Dgiphy-downsized-large.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  How to say Hello World?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log('Hello, World!');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bye-world"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bye World
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.write('BYE WORLD');

      <title>The JavaScript Call Stack</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dani8439/the-javascript-call-stack-4ec8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Annie Spratt&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/stack-of-books?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-javascript-call-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the JavaScript Call Stack?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt;: A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its most basic level, the call stack is where our code is executed, using execution context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript engine, a program that runs JavaScript code, contains both a call stack and a heap. For now, just know that the heap is a large, unstructured memory pool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8F2z-tzw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAQPR.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8F2z-tzw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.stack.imgur.com/xAQPR.png" alt="Visual Representation of the Call Stack Imgur"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-the-call-stack-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is the Call Stack Important?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is single threaded, or synchronous. It can only do one thing at a time. We can give it 100 tasks to perform, but it can't perform all 100 tasks simultaneously. It has to go through the process of completing one task before moving onto the next. It's incredibly orderly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the call stack, say for example, these 100 tasks are all functions. The call stack will stack each function's execution context on top of each other, in the order that they were called, like a pile of books, or boxes, or lego pieces, etc. At the top of the pile, is the current execution context we are within. Once that execution context is finished running, it'll be removed from the top of the pile. The book will be popped off, and it can move down the one directly below. And this will continue happening until the entire stack has been emptied, and the call stack returns to the global execution context, until something new is called. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens when there is a task within a task, or a second function within another function when in that call stack? In that case, if a second function has been called within a function, a new execution context is created, and pushed onto the top of the stack. The execution of that first function is paused, the second function is run through, and once that is completed, it is popped off the the call stack, and we return to the execution context of the first function, which then continues until it's finished, and we return to the Global Execution Context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it might seem a little silly, here is an example of how switching execution contexts, and moving through the call stack works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function first(){
    console.log("Inside First.")
    function second(){
        console.log("First execution context paused, now inside Second.")
        function third(){
            console.log("Second execution context paused, now inside Third.")
        }
      third();
      console.log("Return to second's execution context."); 
    } 
  second();
  console.log("Return to first's execution context.");
}

first()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When first is called, it will print out to the console:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Inside First.
First execution context paused, now inside Second.
Second execution context paused, now inside Third.
Return into second's execution context.
Return to first's execution context.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every time a new function was called, the call stack worked its way through the execution context until completed, before moving back to the previous function, until eventually, all execution contexts were finished, and we returned to the Global Execution Context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global execution context will only pop off of the call stack when our program finishes, either by closing a browser window, or closing the terminal. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on this past week, what was something you were proud of accomplishing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All wins count — big or small 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of 'wins' include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a new project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing a tricky bug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying out a new recipe... or whatever else might spark joy ❤️ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday — and congrats on your wins! 🎊 &lt;/p&gt;
