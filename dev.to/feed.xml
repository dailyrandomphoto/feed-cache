  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being a good developer, your prowess in coding is well exhibited in your ability to relate and make easy technologies and frameworks you come across in your path as a programmer, in technical articles. Not only that, but you are also able to teach newbies and improve experts alike, and most importantly, yourself, the difficulties in a language and how you were able to overcome them using certain technologies and frameworks.&lt;br&gt;
In this article, I take you on a 10-runged ladder on how you can become a successful technical writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#headlines-that-scream-read-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Headlines that scream, "Read On!"
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how interesting or educative the content of your article might be, if you've got a poor headline, no reader will be prompted to see what is within.&lt;br&gt;
The headline can be likened to the wrapper of a Christmas present, the beauty of the wrapper will create an impression of beautiful content in the receiver's mind, even before checking, but an ugly wrapper on the other side will create an ugly content impression.&lt;br&gt;
As a technical writer, you have to be choosy in your choice of headline for your article. Headlines that will convince and urge the readers to read the content. &lt;br&gt;
The headline should be given to the article after the content has been completed, because, the content will determine and must correspond to the headline given.&lt;br&gt;
Your headline should not give an appetizing pizza impression and upon consumption give a whack taste, that is, you should not give your article a headline that does not provide what it is stating in the content of the article, this will only make readers filter off any newly produced article.&lt;br&gt;
Your headlines should speak, "Continue Reading!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learn-and-stick-to-a-particular-technology-or-framework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learn and stick to a Particular Technology or Framework
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nEtqhBZ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bpzf4r2myf6raw4fsrn2.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nEtqhBZ3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bpzf4r2myf6raw4fsrn2.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Be it a frontend, backend, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or any software developer, the credit of getting used to a particular technology or framework cannot be understated, most especially in technical writing. The audience you're writing for is to be taken as newbies or intermediates to any software you're writing on and explaining a language or technology you're not consistent with will make you look like a confused fellow.&lt;br&gt;
It is more dangerous on the part of a newbie because they tend to practice any new skill they learn, and your inconsistency in explanation will turn out to make them bad at what they're doing, even to the point of giving up on a language, or at worse, programming.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, writing about a technology you're very familiar with and used to, will after trials, make readers come back to the article, to express profound gratitude, and even turn on the notification bell, expecting your next article, because they knew what they gained from the previous one and look forward to what they'll be getting in the latest release.&lt;br&gt;
So you see why it is important for you to write, based on your experience of a familiar language or technology.&lt;br&gt;
Just as it could be very helpful, when well done, it could also be dangerous if you're not fit for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#know-the-tricks-shortcuts-and-easy-method-of-getting-problems-solved"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Know the Tricks, Shortcuts, and Easy Method of Getting Problems Solved
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfimEr3e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dwmyrcba6v3lrwolmnfw.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfimEr3e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dwmyrcba6v3lrwolmnfw.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The audience expects to get a better and easier way to do something they have been struggling with for a long time. Introducing shortcuts and tricks can also make the readers realize that the time spent, wasted on writing long lines of code can be much reduced in writing a short line of code and still arriving at the same result.&lt;br&gt;
Shortcuts, tricks, better ways should if not all, take the better part of your article because that Is what the readers want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-it-clear-simple-and-concise"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep It Clear, Simple, and Concise
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won't expect yourself to spend much time digesting a long and strenuous explanation when it can be expressed in simple terms, keeping the points intact. Just as it is uneasy for you to do this, imagine the uneasiness you could be making the readers pass through if you're guilty of this.&lt;br&gt;
Writing long explanations can easily bore readers and make them skip to the next article. Only you haven't got an article on that topic! &lt;br&gt;
Also, be sure to arrange your content in order of increasing urgency. From the introduction to the least important, linking up sequentially to the most important, and finally ending it with a conclusion; a short recap of what is expected of the readers to have learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it simple, clear, and concise, these matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-unambiguous-in-your-language-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be Unambiguous in Your Language Use
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself reading a book, and having a dictionary opened before you at the same time to look up strange words and terms, it is demeaning! If there are simple words that could be used, use them. You are not writing to show your erudition in English, instead, your proficiency in code is what is needed.&lt;br&gt;
There are lots of tools that could be of help, breaking down long vocabularies and retaining its meaning, for example, Grammarly. It has a free version that can be installed and used. It also corrects grammatical errors.&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, it is advisable to stick to a particular person and tense to avoid getting both yourself and the reader confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clearly-define-used-abbreviation-if-possible-avoid-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Clearly Define Used Abbreviation, If Possible, Avoid it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing technical articles, it is very important to minimize your use of abbreviations. And whenever it is used, its meaning must be clearly stated close to it, and in reusing it, the full meaning must not be far from it, that is, the abbreviation and full meaning cannot be at the beginning of a page and be reused alone at the lower end of the page. The full meaning may be easily forgotten if not properly stated causing the reader to scroll up and down to remember.&lt;br&gt;
To be on the safer side, it's better to do completely without it and use only the full meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stay-clear-from-plagiarism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stay Clear From Plagiarism!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DQ_qHTrI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k5zrodl9mfcil0uuxgux.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DQ_qHTrI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k5zrodl9mfcil0uuxgux.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
plagiarism is the act of reusing someone else's work and not citing properly the owner of the work or at all. This act has been known to bring down a lot of writers, once a writer has been discovered to be using someone else's work and not giving proper recognition to the real author, the writer and his work will lose esteem and that spells waterloo for the writer. One can also be fined for this if it's a copyrighted work.&lt;br&gt;
Paraphrasing, which is the lifting and copying of another author's work, that is, restating and rearranging another author's work to make it look as if you wrote it, is also another aspect to be avoided as it has the same pitfall as plagiarism for any writer caught in the act.&lt;br&gt;
As a technical writer, you are to avoid plagiarism and paraphrasing, whenever you quote another's work, cite the owner properly and where it was taken from. There are tools to use to avoid these traps which most writers tend to fall into, like Plagiarism Checker, an app that checks for copied works. Do well to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#move-on-to-another-technology-or-framework-loop-over-become-better"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Move On To Another Technology Or Framework, Loop Over, Become Better
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P4fByCma--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e0rfads5wxnh6urg09ov.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P4fByCma--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e0rfads5wxnh6urg09ov.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After you've become ground in a language or technology, you should move on to a new one, learn its basics, tricks, shortcuts, because it is what the readers expect from you, and easy methods. They always look up to a new trick each time they read your article and sooner or later your article will become a bore if it only offers a particular technology all the time. This won't be cool. &lt;br&gt;
Moreover, doing this prompts readers to explore other languages and frameworks.&lt;br&gt;
Although it is painstaking, going through another technology and learning its basics to make things simple for readers, but, trust me, it pays off. You advance your game in tech and readers get more knowledge from you. So get moving and step up your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-open-to-criticism-smears-and-correction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be Open To Criticism, Smears, and Correction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how good your article might be, you are bound to get criticized by readers, some who may be better at it than you or others who are just in the habit of criticism.  In the critiques, you learn a better way of doing it, some of which you don't know or might have skipped are revealed and you get better at it by taking to corrections. &lt;br&gt;
Never get down because of critique and stop what you are doing, instead, learn from it, buckle down to it and become better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#liven-your-articles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Liven Your Articles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading whole long lines of text may soon become tiresome to readers and make them scroll down instead of perusing or at worse leave your article for another. Liven your articles with pictures and GIFs that relate to the subject matter. Pictures and GIFs serve as a soothing panacea to readers and a short break to calm them while reading for better comprehension. &lt;br&gt;
Do not make your article a bore to readers, liven it. Moreover, don't get tempted to plaster the whole page with pictures and GIFs, they make the article look childish.&lt;br&gt;
Liven your articles, be moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you've learned how to impart the knowledge of tech to others via writing great technical articles in ten simple steps. A good follow-up of these steps will in no time help you ascend the apex of technical writing and probably, depending on your dexterity, land you a job.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>How To Write A Good README File</title>
      <author>Boyan Iliev</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:20:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/boiliev/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file-2c0d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/boiliev/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file-2c0d</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're familiar with GitHub, then you know what a README file is. But if you don't know what it is, you can think of it as the introduction to your repository. It's very helpful that while looking at someone's repo you can just scroll down to their README file and have a look at what their project is all about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's crucial that your project gets introduced properly because if it isn't, the chances of someone pressing on the repo are low. That's why having a good README file shouldn't be overlooked and you should spend a good amount of your time on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am going to share some tips with you about how you can improve your README file, and hopefully, it can help you with your repos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choose-an-easy-name-for-your-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choose an easy name for your project
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the README.md file let's quickly mention the name of the project itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people search for different projects, the last thing they will want to see is: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"cool-javascript-game-about-colors-and-rgb-colors-and-even-more-colors"&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that this example is a little over-exaggerated, but you get the point. No one is going to press on a repo with such a long name. It's best if you try to have a simple and short name for your project that gets right to the point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the example, above we could just use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"javascript-color-game"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A name like this has a higher chance of getting clicked on and taken a look at. So make sure that your repos name is simple and straight to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#give-a-descriptive-summary-of-your-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Give a descriptive summary of your project
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the repo name cleared out, let's focus on the README.md file!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone visits your repo they can scroll down and read the README file. It should have a description of what your project is. But you wouldn't want it to be too short. And neither should it be too long. Now if it's a very big project then by all means you should give a proper explanation of what it is and what it does. But in most cases, it should be a well-written and structured text. There are five steps that I would recommend you follow while writing your README file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step #1
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a quick introduction to what the project is about&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, if you made a to-do list using JavaScript, write about that. But don't get into too much depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step #2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write what your code uses&lt;/strong&gt;. For example HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step #3
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a few more details about the project&lt;/strong&gt;. Write things that would make you take interest in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step #4
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write something about yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. You could say where you work, what your goals are, or share some of your previous projects. It's okay to share what you have created or what you are trying to accomplish &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step #5
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;strong&gt;use images&lt;/strong&gt;. Show the reader what exactly the project is. Just by reading about it isn't going to get their full interest. But by seeing an image of it, they will be more likely to get more into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these are some tips about writing a good README file. It's very important that you get comfortable writing these things. It could help you change the level of interaction your GitHub repo gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this post has helped you in improving your README files and I hope to see some great repos with great README files out on GitHub soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to create an eBook from Markdown using Ibis?</title>

  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I wrote two open-source eBooks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is when I came across a tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/themsaid/ibis"&gt;Ibis&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/themsaid"&gt;Mohamed Said&lt;/a&gt; who is a Developer at Laravel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibis allows you to generate an awesome PDF for your eBook, and you can just use markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I will show you how to get started with Ibis and write that eBook that you have always been planning to write!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to have Composer installed, if you don't have it yet, you can follow the steps here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://devdojo.com/tnylea/composer-why-what-and-how"&gt;How to install Composer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to install Ibis, all that you need to do is run the following &lt;code&gt;composer&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;composer global require themsaid/ibis
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the installation, you can test if the &lt;code&gt;ibis&lt;/code&gt; command is available with the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibis -V
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you are sure that you have the Ibis command line tool installed, you can instantiate a new project with the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibis init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Make sure to run the command in an empty directory where you would store your Markdown files later on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The init command will generate the following files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/assets
/assets/fonts
/assets/cover.jpg
/assets/theme-light.html
/assets/theme-dark.html
/content
/ibis.php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can modify the &lt;code&gt;/assets/theme-light.html&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;/assets/theme-dark.html&lt;/code&gt; to change any of the styles for the eBook. For example, I like to increase the size of the text and the line spacing a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to configure &lt;code&gt;ibis&lt;/code&gt; all that you need to do is change the values in the &lt;code&gt;ibis.php&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main settings would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;: The title of your eBook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;: Your anme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt;: Page ranges to be used with the sample command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sample_notice&lt;/code&gt;: A notice printed at the final page of a generated sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-cover-photo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a cover photo
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an awesome tool that you could use for free to generate your cover photo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/join/determined-cork-learn"&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever need to create a graphic, poster, invitation, logo, presentation – or anything that looks good — give Canva a go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the cover photo, just substitute the default &lt;code&gt;/assets/cover.jpg&lt;/code&gt; with your image!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#markdown-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Markdown files
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above, you can then start writing your eBook! The content would be stored in the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; folder where you will have to add your Markdown files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibis would read all of the &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files in the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; folder and would use all &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; titles as the name of the chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with Markdown, make sure to check out this guide &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-pdf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building the PDF
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your content ready, in order to build the PDF of your eBook, just use the following commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light mode
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibis build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark mode
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibis build dark
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to generate a sample of your eBook use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light mode sample:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibis sample
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark mode sample:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ibis sample dark
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you run the command, it will generate your PDF and store them in the &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output that you will see would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;==&amp;gt; Preparing Export Directory ...
==&amp;gt; Parsing Markdown ...
==&amp;gt; Adding Book Cover ...
==&amp;gt; Building PDF ...
==&amp;gt; Writing PDF To Disk ...

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>A tale from the future: Johnny and the woman from department B 🤗</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/the-tale-of-johnny-big-brain-48dm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there dear viewer, the year is 2030 and Johnny is sat crying into his bowl of oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His boss has just given him an impossible task - change every single list on the site to have less padding, but don't change the padding anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had just spent the previous evening writing a regex to find all of his inline &lt;code&gt;p-2&lt;/code&gt; classes on his lists, but he realised the futility of trying to parse HTML with a Regex, many before him had warned of this but Johnny didn't listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He threw his oatmeal in the bin, dragged himself to the office and sat there, staring at the screen, in agony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2462 different lists across the site, some statically implemented, some generated via templates...they all looked pretty similar but he just couldn't see a way to change the styling on all of them at once without breaking the padding on other items on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly a woman he had never seen before popped her head over his monitor "you all right there Johnny?"...he started crying. "No" he sobbed, "My boss wants this impossible task completing".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman smiled "let me show you something" she said softly, sympathetic to Johnny's plight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She showed him her departments website, it looked very similar to his and was equally as complex. "Inspect that list right there" she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny did as he was instructed and he couldn't believe his eyes. The HTML it was....well....there was more HTML than classes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What is this witchcraft?" he asked her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is the way the internet was designed to work" she exclaimed. "In the old days this is how we wrote websites". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where can I learn this power?" he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not from a Jedi" she replied. Johnny looked confused, he didn't get the reference. The woman rolled her eyes and started to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You see all of the lists on my site are defined in one place". Johnny looked on in awe. She showed him this thing called a "Style Sheet". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"See here", she continued, "I have added CSS that defines the padding, margin, colour etc. here".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny's eyes widened as she changed one line of this magical language and pressed save. She went through different pages across the site and the lists had different padding, but nothing else had changed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where did you learn this skill?" he asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oh it is the old ways, the ways before 'The wind' hysteria hit".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"teach me!" Johnny exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny fidgeted as she explained, feeling uncomfortable at the thought of this new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But how can I tell what styles are applied to an element if they aren't defined in utility classes within the HTML?" he asked. She introduced him to the inspect element tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Amazing" Johnny exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But how can I make sure the team follows a design system, surely this leads to confusion?" he exclaimed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Great question" she answered, "you write documentation to explain the classes". This idea of &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; documentation was new to Johnny, but he quickly caught on to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Oh so if I want a card, I design a card element for the whole site"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"yes, that is it" she exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And anyone can use that card element", he asked, excited by this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"he's beginning to believe" she quipped, suddenly wearing a pair of sunglasses and a long black coat. Johnny once again didn't get the reference, so she powered on regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yes, but you have to make sure your team know not to create their own version, they need to know it exists, otherwise confusion will follow".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"So what you are saying is I should create a card component, then document the component so others know how to use it".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yes, you are getting it now. You see 'The wind' happened because developers were too lazy to read and create documentation, they were obsessed with the 'new and shiny' things that promised a better life without effort, they just couldn't see the mess they were creating at the time. Notice how we have no build step, notice how I can just grab this CSS file and put it onto this site and without &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; extra configuration it works."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny finally saw it, his HTML was legible and had few classes. He could make changes in one place and update the whole site in seconds. He could add a new widget in minutes, document it, and his team could then read about the widget, apply the relevant &lt;strong&gt;class&lt;/strong&gt; (yes just one class!) and everything was displayed consistently and correctly across thousands of pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You have learned the old ways, I must go now". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wrote &lt;code&gt;.woman *{display: none}&lt;/code&gt; and vanished. Johnny tried it, &lt;code&gt;{johnny *: {display: none}&lt;/code&gt; but it didn't work, "oh well, maybe I just wasn't &lt;strong&gt;class&lt;/strong&gt;y enough", Johnny thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny went to his boss with this new way of doing things. His boss was amazed, his boss told Johnny he should spread the news far and wide of his discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It isn't my discovery" Johnny exclaimed, "It was the lady from department B who taught me".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His boss turned white (which scared Johnny as his boss was from Jamaica) - "There is no department B", his boss stuttered, "We got rid of it as their staff didn't work 100 hours a week and we couldn't understand how they got things done still". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny understood now, the old ways had been forgotten because of laziness, lack of understanding and the short sightedness of developers. But it has now started to hurt developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If only people spent as much time documenting their CSS and learning CSS as they did evangelising about the latest shiny thing, we wouldn't be in this mess." Johnny thought, "But how could anyone have foreseen strange client requirements like changing one item on a specific element across a whole site. How could anyone have foreseen any of this?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny continued studying the old texts, learning more and more about this simple and misunderstood language. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then went on to teach of his findings. His Ted Talks were legendary, thousands of developers flocked to see this new way of doing things. Johnny got paid thousands to show people his tricks that he had learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnny retired young and rich, he was known as "Johnny Big Brain".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sat on his Yacht, thinking about that mysterious woman who was the secret to his success. He started thinking about the last time he saw her. He wanted to see her, he wanted to thank her for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grabbed his laptop, taking all his knowledge he had acquired reading the old texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started typing....&lt;code&gt;.woman *{display: fixed}&lt;/code&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is just a silly jab at the tailwind hype train making people pick up bad practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind has its place and it is a useful (read awesome) tool for prototyping and side projects, just step back from the hype for a minute every once in a while if you are building something bigger, make sure you aren't painting yourself into a corner like Johnny did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to use Tailwind, just don't use it exclusively in place of CSS without really thinking about it as I can see a few big "gotchyas" coming down the road that a lot of people are overlooking due to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;utility classes for local adjustments, "proper" classes for repeated items and you will be as happy as Johnny Big Brain in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to identify fonts on web pages. Firebug and Webkit Inspector are easy enough to use for developers. However, for others, this should not be necessary. With this extension, you could inspect web fonts by just hovering on them. It is that simple and elegant. It also detects the services used for serving the web fonts. Supports Typekit and Google Font API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd"&gt;Redux Dev Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Flutter - Most Trending Framework for Mobile Development</title>
      <author>Gurshehzad Singh</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 06:14:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gurshehzadsingh/flutter-most-trending-framework-for-mobile-development-1953</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gurshehzadsingh/flutter-most-trending-framework-for-mobile-development-1953</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to app development, it can be difficult to find a compromise between quality and productivity: either developers have to build the same application twice on both iOS and Android, or they have to settle for a cross-platform solution that makes it difficult to deliver the native experience that customers demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here comes Flutter – an SDK that is making headlines these days in the mobile development space. Its creators say that Flutter offers a new path for mobile development, focused foremost on native performance, advanced visuals, and dramatically improving developer velocity and productivity. It has already been adopted by some of the most famous companies such as Alibaba, Google Ads, Birch Finance, App Tree, Hamilton Musical and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s try to understand what Flutter is and what makes it so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter is an app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS, Android, and web from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It enables developers to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, it is one of demo apps from the Flutter Gallery, a collection of Flutter sample apps you can run right after installing Flutter and setting up your environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V-yVoB-i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s9irj406kxm26ccvaax6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V-yVoB-i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s9irj406kxm26ccvaax6.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app – Shrine – has high-quality scrolling images, interactive cards, buttons, dropdown lists, and a shopping cart page. Not bad. But let’s slice and dice it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, what is definitely good about Flutter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some points why Flutter might become the next big thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1.Building Android + iOS apps at once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Flutter uses the same code base, you do not need to write any individual code for both the platforms. Ok, but this is similar to any cross-platform thing. Next, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2.Quick Performance and No Compatibility Issues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike ReactNative, NativeScript or Ionic Flutter doesn’t require a JavaScript bridge to talk to OEM widgets. Flutter works more like a gaming engine. All the buttons, text, media stuff are being built inside Flutter’s engine. And this gives the application an additional performance boost. And that sounds interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.High-Speed Coding and Prototype development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a change in the app and see them in the blink of an eye. What can be better? All thanks to Hot-Reload. If you’re only changing the state of the existing app structure then you can see your changes in under one second by using Hot Reload. If you changed the app structure by adding or removing individual components, or even large sections of your app, that takes a little longer… 6-8 seconds under most conditions. Great, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.A Perfect Choice for Advanced UI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter renders all parts of the interface using internal graphics engine called Skia – the same that is used in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Sublime Text 3. This fast and well-optimized piece of software allows Flutter to behave differently than most of the other mobile development frameworks. Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.DART Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter uses Dart – a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. One of the greatest advantages here is that Dart code can be compiled in three different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is truly native, Ahead Of Time (AOT) compiled machine code executable that requires no interpretation. And you can compile executables not only for Android and iOS, but for Windows, Mac, and Linux, too. But, of course, you’ll need to compile once for each individual platform, since each uses a different kind of executable.&lt;br&gt;
Second, Dart can be Just in Time (JIT) compiled. And here we have this “Hot-Reload” that was mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;
Third, Dart can be compiled in a way that results in JavaScript. This allows Flutter to do something truly amazing. It lets you put the same app you wrote for mobile and desktop into a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.Fuchsia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an open-source operating system currently being spearheaded by Google. It uses a micro-kernel called Zircon, and is designed to be able to run everything from the simplest picture frame up through the most bleeding-edge mobile devices. Why is it mentioned here? Simple. Firstly, Flutter drives the UI for the entire Fuchsia operating system. Secondly, this means you will be able to use Flutter to write apps for all kinds of IoT devices, from refrigerators to alarm clocks, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information about practical use of some of these things you could find in this article of an Android developer who is sharing his thoughts on Flutter after having rebuilt his app from Java to Dart. Here I only mention the number of files/code-lines before the rebuilding (for the app built on Java) – 179/12176, and after it (for the app rebuilt on Dart) – 31/1735. As you see, numbers speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawbacks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are some things you should be ready for if going with Flutter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1.Learning DART Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As all the Flutter apps are written in Dart, you should understand that there is no way to escape this language if you’re considering Flutter to build your app on. Still, this reactive language looks familiar if you have worked with languages like Java or JavaScript. And the experience with object-oriented languages will be helpful as well. Still, you will definitely have to spend some time understanding all the syntactical sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2.Everything in Flutter is a Widget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layouts are widgets, the typography is a widget, color is a widget, button is a widget. Even the app itself is a complete widget. And this might take some time getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not intuitive for anyone getting started, to think that “widgetly” :). It might take you up to a month to get comfortable with Flutter. Adding margins, paddings and other attributes is not intuitive at first. Also, you’ll need to spend some time understanding Box constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once you get there, you’ll see that it was totally worth the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.A bigger APK size&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be surprised if you see your fresh-out-of-the-oven flutter app is bigger in size than its native counterpart by 50-60%. As the flutter-made apps are used with built-in widgets and not platform widgets, their size seems to be usually large. Currently, the smallest possible app which can be made using Flutter can’t weigh less than 4MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.Flutter is not an operating system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it does not have direct access to things like cameras, Bluetooth, GPS and other hardware. So if your app communicates with any hardware via Bluetooth, for example, then you’d have to develop these features separately for iOS and Android and integrate them into flutter afterwards. In this case, one of the major selling points of cross-platform development (i.e. time), won’t be much beneficial as you’d end up spending time creating these features natively for both the apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.Flutter does not have a very large support community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter is still relatively new and does not have a community as large as other cross-platform solutions such as React Native or pure native apps, so it will need some time to grow the network of supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are someone who is afraid of documentation (still, cannot but mention that Flutter documentation is really good) this point might become a drawback to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concluding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as far as there’s no other templating dialect for the time being that allows you to construct your UI by setting widgets, Flutter looks very interesting indeed. Of course, it might initially seem difficult, but later on, it does reduce the amount of coding, saves time, and looks better, all thanks to the power of widget support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flutter makes it easy to develop higher-performing mobile applications. This SDK further guides you with logic, reactive development, and composition. Moving ahead, this pays profits as your application becomes bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the one should keep in mind the advantages of Dart language that can increase productivity in times. You can release your app to six platforms while needing only one team to write the code. Also think about what it would mean if you only had to worry about maintaining one code-base, instead of six. Still, you (or your team) will definitely spend some extra-time to learn Dart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no matter what technology is used, cross-platform apps are still way behind native apps in terms of performance. So if you have the budget to setup two different teams for iOS and Android, we believe you should consider going native.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with Flutter you will get your app faster, and faster development saves you money (what is good anyway), and allows to validate your idea quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So regardless of the number of individuals in your group or what your objective is, Flutter is a good alternative at least to try. So take a stab at coding DART for some time and check whether you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JS: Sort an Array of Objects on multiple columns/keys</title>
      <author>Mark Dsouza</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 06:03:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/markbdsouza/js-sort-an-array-of-objects-on-multiple-columns-keys-2bj1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/markbdsouza/js-sort-an-array-of-objects-on-multiple-columns-keys-2bj1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's see how you can completely configure the sorting of an Array of objects. Let's say we have the below data set for our entire example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let objs = [
  { name: 'Mark',
    age: 30,
    RollNo: 'R01'
  },
  { name: 'Anne',
    age: 20,
    RollNo: 'R02'
  },
  { name: 'James',
    age: 40,
    RollNo: 'R03'
  },
  { name: 'Jerry',
    age: 30,
    RollNo: 'R04'
  },
  { name: 'Lucy',
    age: 30,
    RollNo: 'R05'
  },
  { name: 'Mark',
    age: 30,
    RollNo: 'R06'
  },
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at the raw data we have with a &lt;code&gt;console.table(objs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W9bbH45C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kdphmk8u69l8ozb4va2i.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W9bbH45C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kdphmk8u69l8ozb4va2i.PNG" alt="Table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#single-column-sort"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Single Column Sort
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now say we want to sort this data across one column. The best way to do this is the sort() method. Check out the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
An example from there down below on a simple array of Strings&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const months = ['March', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Dec'];
months.sort();
console.log(months);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output is &lt;code&gt;["Dec", "Feb", "Jan", "March"]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This automatically sorts the &lt;strong&gt;original&lt;/strong&gt; array in alphabetical order and returns the original array as well on calling sort(). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sorting-on-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sorting on String
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above example, let us try and sort our object&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;objs.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a.name.localeCompare(b.name)
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RTHq4nHM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v12q6yl1427r57sausim.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RTHq4nHM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v12q6yl1427r57sausim.PNG" alt="Single Sort on Name"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is similar to a SQL Statement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM OBJS ORDER BY NAME; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sorting-on-number-the-es6-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sorting on number (the ES6 way)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ES6, we can even write it as an inline function. Let's try and sort based on the number field age.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;objs.sort((a, b) =&amp;gt; a.age - b.age);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uu8Mj5R8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jspephc1d6cmqlb3zmrd.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uu8Mj5R8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jspephc1d6cmqlb3zmrd.PNG" alt="Single Sort on Age"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is similar to a SQL Statement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM OBJS ORDER BY AGE; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multi-column-sort"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multi Column Sort
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can combine sorts using the || operator in the order of the sorting we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sort-by-age-and-then-name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sort by Age, and then Name
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;objs.sort((a,b)=&amp;gt; (a.age - b.age || a.name.localeCompare(b.name)  ));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G_0huCUq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u27vu0k022o8rx8ige9d.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G_0huCUq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u27vu0k022o8rx8ige9d.PNG" alt="MultiSort on age and name"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is similar to a SQL Statement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM OBJS ORDER BY AGE, NAME; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sort-by-name-and-then-age"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sort by Name, and then Age
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can modify the order of how the sort is done. That is if we want to sort by name first and then age&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;objs.sort((a,b)=&amp;gt; (a.name.localeCompare(b.name) || a.age - b.age));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is similar to a SQL Statement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM OBJS ORDER BY NAME, AGE; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#changing-to-descending-order"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Changing to Descending order
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted Age and Name to be descending order we just need to swap the above command with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;objs.sort((a,b)=&amp;gt; (b.age - a.age || b.name.localeCompare(a.name)  ));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--voF_zJpJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/40fl85uthgaazevdl61l.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--voF_zJpJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/40fl85uthgaazevdl61l.PNG" alt="MultiSort on age and name Descending"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is similar to a SQL Statement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM OBJS ORDER BY NAME DESC, AGE DESC; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extend-to-sort-on-all-3-columns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extend to sort on all 3 columns
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above logic, you can append how many ever sort columns you might need in the order you need them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;objs.sort((a,b)=&amp;gt; (a.name.localeCompare(b.name) || a.age - b.age || a.RollNo - b.RollNo));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuYPVi9p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oplqkq3wyfq7nk6hvbbj.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuYPVi9p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oplqkq3wyfq7nk6hvbbj.PNG" alt="MultiSort on 3 columns"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This is similar to a SQL Statement&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM OBJS ORDER BY NAME , AGE , ROLLNO; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-case"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Case
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you have an API that returns an Array of Objects in a random manner. Maybe you have a table in your UI and you want to sort this data that comes in such that it makes the most sense for your user(sort on some category or maybe price). All you need to do is tweak the above logic and tada! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Common Challenges Faced by Web Developers</title>
      <author>koshti Rahul</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/gnral_opll/5-common-challenges-faced-by-web-developers-1m2p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an age where the first thing that attracts a customer or a client to your business, is your virtual presence, you cannot do without a sound digital format that puts your business’ best foot forward. Establishing an excellent web application might be easy, but as technology evolves by the hour, it becomes difficult to upgrade and update your web application to stay relevant in the ever-changing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Developers, therefore, find it extremely challenging to keep up with the technological advancements. It is almost like walking on a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you constantly need to revise your application and update it to accommodate the latest technological trends, and on the other hand, a failure to do so would directly lead to a loss of customer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the Internet today has made countless businesses offering similar services accessible to the customers at a single click, and if your business fails to provide them the best solution, it wouldn’t take them long to replace you with a business that isn’t technologically challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a matter of staying on your toes, and hence, the need to be extremely alert and aware of the business and related-environment. Though, each day brings a new obstacle for a web developer, certain common challenges that are faced across the industry can be traced. Discussed below are the 5 common challenges that are faced by web developers throughout the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TDD Practicality</title>
      <author>Steven Kaufman</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 05:39:22 +0000</pubDate>

  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young person getting into programming, it's hard not to notice the wildly varying cultural perspectives around the industry. &lt;br&gt;
From just watching YouTube tutorials, I think I was completely oblivious to the very existence of unit testing for at least a full year after learning the fundamentals of Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, however, I stumbled upon Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)'s talks on YouTube. &lt;br&gt;
If you haven't already seen his six publicly available hour-and-a-half long talks, I highly recommend watching ALL of them. &lt;br&gt;
I've personally rewatched and listened to them like podcasts in the car at least three times over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj"&gt;Youtube: Clean Code - Uncle Bob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#uncle-bob-and-tdd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Uncle Bob and TDD
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, he's one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, a 50+ year software professional, and an extreme advocate for Test Driven Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This advocacy for TDD sets him apart from even some of the other people who worked on the Agile Manifesto (which was designed to be a great compromise between wildly different programming philosophies).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-question"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Question
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around with TDD in personal projects, I can see its value, and I'm inclined to believe what Uncle Bob says. However, I want to be careful and make sure that I'm not blindly indoctrinating myself into some idealistic nonsense before I have much in the way of real world experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen the debates against TDD online, and Uncle Bob himself warns against trying to adopt things like TDD and Agile too quickly, as they're intended to be skills and disciplines that one has to practice to become effective at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is simply this, if anyone would like to share their opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-might-tdd-ever-be-a-bad-idea"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why might TDD ever be a bad idea?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-tdd-always-a-good-idea"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is TDD always a good idea?
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Protecting API keys in Flutter</title>
      <author>Aadityasiva</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 05:00:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aadityasivas/protecting-api-keys-in-flutter-619</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aadityasivas/protecting-api-keys-in-flutter-619</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is always a fear that one day you might end up leaking your API key in a public git repository. In flutter is there are many ways of hiding the API key some are not working and some don't work properly in this article I will be showing you one way to work with API keys in flutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-see-how-we-can-do-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's see how we can do it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using &lt;a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv"&gt;this package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are using it in a project &lt;strong&gt;with null safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;flutter_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;^4.0.0-nullsafety.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are using it in a project &lt;strong&gt;without null safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;flutter_dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;^3.1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;then create a file in the root directory called &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don't know &lt;strong&gt;what a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file is&lt;/strong&gt; it is basically a file in which we store secret variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file you can add your secret API keys in this format&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY=This is a super secret API key 
THIS_CAN_BE_CALLED_ANYTHING=This here can be anything like ut4ihyeFn49
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: Never commit these .env files in your version control.&lt;br&gt;
If you are using git version control system add the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file to &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making this &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file add it as an asset in the &lt;code&gt;pubspec.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;assets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.env&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;flutter pub get
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;main.dart&lt;/code&gt; file load the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight dart"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DotEnv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Future&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DotEnv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;fileName:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;".env"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//...runapp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in your code you can load the variables from the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file anywhere like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight dart"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it, thanks for reading hope this short article helps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
