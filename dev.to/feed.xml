&lt;p&gt;Hello folks, if you want to learn Machine learning and Deep learning in 2022 and look for the best online courses and tutorials, you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will share some of the best free classes to learn Machine learning and Deep learning online. By the way, If you are thinking of learning &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-resources-to-learn-data-science-and-machine-learning-best-of-lot-f153e1f44e89"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/11-best-resources-to-learn-data-science-and-machine-learning-in-2020-2od"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-5-advanced-deep-learning-and-neural-network-courses-to-learn-in-2020-a273f5eddca5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you are not alone; more and more people are starting with these advanced skills worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen a lot of interest from Software engineers in machine learning and the Artificial intelligence space. They are totally caught up with the craze of developing programs that can recognize numbers, alphabets, vehicles, and several other image scanning stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craze is very similar to what the 1980's programmer has about video games, where moving a character on screen gives the joy you get when your program correctly identifies the number or letter you make from hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From college graduates to junior programmers and from experienced programmers to software architects, all show interest in &lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/10/top-10-data-science-and-machine-learning-courses.html"&gt;Machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2019/11/top-5-artificial-intelligence-courses.html"&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to become part of the next technical revolution we may be witnessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering what Machine learning and Deep Learning are, let me briefly overview them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning programs use algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned. One example of that was selecting the best Cucumber from a lot done by a Japanese programmer; you can read the full story &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/how-a-japanese-cucumber-farmer-is-using-deep-learning-and-tensorflow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network" that can learn and make intelligent decisions independently. It's more complicated than machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these free online courses are great, I also recommend you to check out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;offerid=634352.1&amp;amp;type=10&amp;amp;tmpid=14538&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmachinelearning%2F"&gt;Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python &amp;amp; R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, if you need a comprehensive, in-depth course on Machine Learning. This 45-hour course is fantastic, and you can buy in just $10 on Udemy sales.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  7 Best Free Machine Learning and Deep Learning Courses for Beginners
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I share the list of courses, I'd like to clarify that they are not of inferior quality even though these courses are free. They are just made free by their instructor for promotional and education purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These courses are taken from popular online learning websites and platforms like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/05/top-10-udemy-courses-to-learn-python-programming.html"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/7000-free-pluralsight-courses-to-build-in-demand-tech-skills-without-leaving-your-house-40edb50a8cf2"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-15-free-coursera-courses-and-certifications-for-it-professionals-384207d56f45"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, and FreeCodecamp. Some of them are also available for free on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, sometimes these free courses are covered in paid courses once the instructor reaches their promotional targets, so please be careful and check the course price before you join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here is my list of some of the best free online courses to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning online by yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1what-is-machine-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fwhat-is-machine-learning%2F"&gt;What is Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent free course to learn essential Machine Learning concepts like  Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning with Python demo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Machine Learning, then this free Udemy course is perfect to start with. You will learn about the process of building supervised predictive models and make several of them using &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/10-free-python-courses-for-programmers.html"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, the most widely used programming language for machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the course, you'll receive the thoroughly annotated &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-15-free-coursera-courses-and-certifications-for-it-professionals-384207d56f45"&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt; used in the course. The best thing about this course is that concepts are presented with lots of examples, animations, and plots, making learning really easy, particularly for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Machine Learning from scratch. This is good for beginners and even for people with some experience who want to revise essential Machine learning concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fwhat-is-machine-learning%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZNSzCXUs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0x5JqJJ_GLo/YNaxtivco-I/AAAAAAAAoTA/iNPAWmiCX9oq4UEeML-o3QwvTMcLfsJMwCLcBGAsYHQ/w435-h245/image.png" alt="What is Machine Learning [Free Course on Udemy]" width="435" height="245"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-practical-machine-learning-with-scikitlearn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmachine-learning-one-hour%2F"&gt;Practical Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scikit is one of the popular Python Machine learning libraries. It was initially developed by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project in 2007, and since then, it has become the defacto machine learning library for many programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/10/top-5-courses-to-learn-scikit-learn.html"&gt;Scikit-Learn&lt;/a&gt;, also known as a skeleton, is particularly great for beginners. It offers a high-level interface for many tasks, allowing beginners to practice the entire machine learning workflow and understand the big picture better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in this course, you'll not only learn machine learning basics like what is a target variable or a feature, but also, you'll learn how to create an end-to-end model using &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/05/top-5-courses-to-learn-python-in-depth.html"&gt;Python's&lt;/a&gt; SciKit Learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are key things you will learn in this course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. How to implement regression, classification, and boosting algorithms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  Which algorithms work best for a given dataset &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Data preprocessing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll get complete hands-on experience with the process of machine learning, which includes importing data, cleaning the data, training, and testing, pre-processing, and feature engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmachine-learning-one-hour%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ejYtNwKs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GbJ-oWcS6Ac/XDrygH8hIXI/AAAAAAAAM-E/id032tz6p5kyar9id32Wq6v012Z3cr0vQCLcBGAs/w375-h212/A%252BGentle%252BIntroduction%252Bto%252BMachine%252BLearning%252BUsing%252BSciKit-Learn%252BUdemy%252BFree%252BCourse.jpg" alt="free course to learn Machine learning for beginners" width="374" height="212"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, a perfect course for beginners to kick-start their machine learning journey. Once you know Sci-kit, you can explore more powerful libraries like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/top-5-tensorflow-and-machine-learning-courses-online-programmers.html#axzz5YA0Ub5hS"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt; on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fnumpy-python%2F"&gt;Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python V2&lt;/a&gt; [Free]
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another excellent free course to learn Deep Learning on Udemy. This covers four major Python libraries, like the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/10/top-5-courses-to-learn-numpy-for-python.html"&gt;Numpy&lt;/a&gt;, Scipy, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/11/top-5-free-pandas-courses-for-beginners.html#axzz7CM32Lpjh"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, and Matplotlib stack, crucial to &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/data-science-and-machine-learning-courses-using-python-and-R-programming.html"&gt;Deep learning&lt;/a&gt;, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know, Numpy provides essential building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, while Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://becominghuman.ai/5-best-courses-to-learn-pythons-pandas-libary-for-data-analysis-and-data-science-34b62abb0e96"&gt;Panda's&lt;/a&gt; strength lies in loading data, particularly from the database. At the same time, Matplotlib helps in looking at that data using some standard plots like the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 1.9  hours long course, you will learn all these libraries and learn how to supervise machine learning (classification and regression) with real-world examples using Scikit-Learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main concepts covered in this course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Basic operations in Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Vector, Matrix, and Tensor manipulation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Visualizing data &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Reading, writing, and manipulating DataFrames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also learn how to use &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/10/top-8-python-libraries-for-data-science-machine-learning.html"&gt;Numpy&lt;/a&gt;, Scipy, Matplotlib, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/top-5-courses-to-learn-pandas-for-data-analysis-python.html"&gt;Pandas &lt;/a&gt;to implement numerical algorithms. Most importantly, you will learn the pros and cons of various machine learning models, including Deep Learning Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Boosting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fnumpy-python%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hpr6Esf6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8PIR3T5QAU0/YNauN2tEK3I/AAAAAAAAoS4/c9GQxMTokDgVjEVGVg5vTERshNZv2w8rACLcBGAsYHQ/w401-h226/image.png" alt="free course to learn Deep Learning for beginners" width="401" height="226"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\&lt;br&gt;
In short, an excellent free course to learn Deep Learning using Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib stack.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-machine-learning-course-for-beginners-freecodecamp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Machine Learning Course for Beginners [FreeCodecamp]
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another free online course to learn about Machine Learning concepts and its available for free on Youtube at freecodecamp's youtube channel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a comprehensive 9 hour long Youtube course which is very similar to paid courses like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;offerid=634352.1&amp;amp;type=10&amp;amp;tmpid=14538&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fmachinelearning%2F"&gt;Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python &amp;amp; R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course will teach you the theory and practical application of machine learning concepts from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is developed by Ayush Singh, a 15 year old kid but you will admire his teaching skill and depth of knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

  5. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearnkeras%2F"&gt;Learn Keras: Build 4 Deep Learning Applications&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent free Udemy course to learn another powerful Python machine learning library called Keras. If you don't know, Keras is both a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries like Theano and &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-tensorflow-and-ml-courses-for-programmers-8b30111cad2c"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;. It allows you to define and train neural network models in a few short lines of code, which is just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This free deep learning course will learn how to build an end-to-end Python machine learning project using &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-learn-pytorch-and-keras.html"&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt; and tune a deep learning model and neural network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of this free online course is that the instructor walks through every line of code so you'll be able to understand the model and the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Flearnkeras%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--99L679Bu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--bksopM6tGo/XDrzxsjZBNI/AAAAAAAAM-U/Q3uIg2oHx5ocVNoUS4EzxYOb3BOCywH4wCLcBGAs/w400-h226/A%252BGentle%252BIntroduction%252Bto%252BDeep%252BLearning%252BUsing%252BKeras%252BUdemy%252Bfree%252Bcourse.png" alt="free udemy course to learn Machine learning" width="299" height="169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know the question, you probably won't get the answer right, and this course is all about asking the right machine learning questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is behind one of the coolest technological innovations today, but contrary to popular perception, you don't need to be a math genius to successfully apply &lt;a href="https://becominghuman.ai/top-10-courses-to-learn-tensorflow-for-machine-learning-in-2020-39a31e7cd84b"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, you need to identify whether machine learning can provide an appropriate solution, and in this course, you'll learn how to identify those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topics covered in this course include Classifying Data, Predicting relationships using regression, Recommending a product, and Clustering large data sets into meaningful groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;Pluralsight membership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to access this course, which costs around $29 per month. On the other note, Pluralsight is a great resource, and its membership is definitely worth every penny spent. I have bought the annual membership, which comes with a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, even if you don't have Pluralsight membership, you can still access this course for free by signing up for a &lt;a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Flearn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-day free trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without any commitment, which provides 200 minutes of watch time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall an excellent course to get a high-level overview of what machine learning is and how to use it to solve real-world problems.  This is one of the basic Machine learning courses, but I have put that to the end because it's not entirely free.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do Python One-Liners Make Your Code Faster?</title>
      <author>Naveenkumar M</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 11:02:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/naveenkumarmd/do-python-one-liners-make-your-code-faster-514f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/naveenkumarmd/do-python-one-liners-make-your-code-faster-514f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most Python programmers have a myth that one-liners are the best way of programming and they even think that one-liners make the code faster. Let us check out this thing and analyze how one-liners differ from normal codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-us-consider-some-of-the-five-programs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let us consider some of the five programs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating an array with zeroes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting the even numbers in a range&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-liner for if-else statements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manipulating an array&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking palindrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using the “time” module to check the time taken to execute the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-creating-an-array-with-zeroes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. Creating an array with zeroes&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us create a 2-dimensional array of zeroes with a normal iterative method and let’s note the running time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MYLNm959--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A3Nv7G2VUjpYA-tV2vqAbVw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MYLNm959--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A3Nv7G2VUjpYA-tV2vqAbVw.png" alt="" width="840" height="341"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 12.876641988754272&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have run this program several times and found the maximum value So that we can analyze it easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us check the one-liner for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4OeGxQK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AaKLpcsMg0KQ3etOMY60FIQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4OeGxQK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AaKLpcsMg0KQ3etOMY60FIQ.png" alt="" width="803" height="215"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 4.390255928039551&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-selecting-the-even-numbers-in-a-range"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Selecting the even numbers in a range
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I wish to make the time a notable one. So I iterated the loop 99999999 times. The program is quite simple if the number is even I will append it in the array else nothing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q9GbJ-4n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2Achjhs5jfnCO5FSz9Riy9NQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q9GbJ-4n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2Achjhs5jfnCO5FSz9Riy9NQ.png" alt="" width="743" height="261"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 21.109660625457764&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-liner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wBF8v9qm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A2cjLCg_1exkfB5AooTyqyg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wBF8v9qm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A2cjLCg_1exkfB5AooTyqyg.png" alt="" width="781" height="167"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 9.88336968421936&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-one-liner-ifelse-with-a-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. One liner if-else with a function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us find the count of multiples of 3 in a range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pG63Cq5v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AznKS6fM68YSxplTTXsj0sw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pG63Cq5v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AznKS6fM68YSxplTTXsj0sw.png" alt="" width="864" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 139.78343963623047&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us convert the divisibleby3 function and the main function to one-liners to compare the results.You can even convert the divisibleby3 function into a lambda function to make it even complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pm6ImR-A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A_W_Wgmkdl1ny35xcgkasCg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pm6ImR-A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A_W_Wgmkdl1ny35xcgkasCg.png" alt="" width="864" height="187"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 56.80164098739624&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-manipulating-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Manipulating an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us convert the array of elements to its square values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CqDguuHw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AZQRIxbKHNuY8Ngc-y3jKeA.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CqDguuHw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AZQRIxbKHNuY8Ngc-y3jKeA.png" alt="" width="817" height="184"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 56.80164098739624&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nLDWZggH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AgXZXrD5Ja5Uz1GMs-bIVsg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nLDWZggH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AgXZXrD5Ja5Uz1GMs-bIVsg.png" alt="" width="880" height="88"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 39.76653861999512&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-palindrome-check"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Palindrome check
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a function to check whether a number is a palindrome or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eMo_zw1e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A0Lu_1ZJfn65xPmxNUZDs9A.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eMo_zw1e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A0Lu_1ZJfn65xPmxNUZDs9A.png" alt="" width="867" height="250"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 16.703513860702515&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One liner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8nnpCs7c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AyBrf2hOJw9LVDs0KlH791A.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8nnpCs7c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2AyBrf2hOJw9LVDs0KlH791A.png" alt="" width="802" height="146"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time taken is: 0.16199564933776855&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m astonished by the above results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--78P_ShDa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A_tysjwwkU0t9CWRSH9sPgw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--78P_ShDa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A_tysjwwkU0t9CWRSH9sPgw.png" alt="" width="870" height="442"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above table it is clear that the one liners make the code much faster. It will help you in competitive programming and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Handling image loading and error state in Next.js</title>

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://carlogino.cc/blog/next-image-state-handling"&gt;How to create a loading and error state placeholder for images?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the full code &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/codegino/b9ed69fec8495c5024ef925c432bf1f2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#long-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Long version
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-basic-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a basic image
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;next/image&lt;/code&gt; provides an easy way to create an image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/gf3TZMr.jpeg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Some alt text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, we still need to configure some properties to cater to our specific needs such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A placeholder when loading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An error placeholder when the image fails to load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GIF below shows what a user will see for an image loaded using a slow internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3epU0BBB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/mgOpxkjm3zjT2Utg5Q/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3epU0BBB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/mgOpxkjm3zjT2Utg5Q/giphy.gif" width="480" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives the impression that something is wrong with our app&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-handle-the-loading-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to handle the loading state?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply adding the &lt;code&gt;placeholder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;blurDataURL&lt;/code&gt; will do the trick.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://i.imgur.com/gf3TZMr.jpeg"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blur"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;blurDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/assets/image-placeholder.png"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The code will yield the following result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XiHikoG0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/nNsPF6B8EjQODCbqNM/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XiHikoG0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/nNsPF6B8EjQODCbqNM/giphy.gif" width="480" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a brief delay before the placeholder is loaded&lt;br&gt;
because even the placeholder image is needed to be fetch from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's a need to make sure that there's an immediate placeholder to the image, you refer to this guide on &lt;a href="https://dev.to/codegino/dynamic-image-placeholder-in-nextjs-5052"&gt;how to create a dynamic image placeholder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing is once the placeholder image is loaded, all other images that uses the same asset&lt;br&gt;
will display the placeholder immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BFybkXbg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/p1yrnptxP3GEXKV02B/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BFybkXbg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/p1yrnptxP3GEXKV02B/giphy.gif" width="480" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happens-if-theres-an-error-when-loading-the-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happens if there's an error when loading the image
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that the user will stare at the placeholder for eternity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KZJV30uB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0RJSScx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KZJV30uB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0RJSScx.png" width="788" height="612"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or this sadder version which shows the &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; and a lot of empty space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fnnc1xE1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/WHIrNTn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fnnc1xE1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/WHIrNTn.png" width="787" height="596"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is not fun to see too much unnecessary empty space, is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-display-another-image-during-an-error-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to display another image during an error state?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can simply replace the value of &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; with the path to &lt;code&gt;error image&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;onError&lt;/code&gt; callback when an error happens.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://i.imgur.com/gf3TZMr.jpeg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blur"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;blurDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/assets/image-placeholder.png"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/assets/image-error.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pL94ESIj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/GEtkLddj2L7lk6tqhU/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pL94ESIj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media2.giphy.com/media/GEtkLddj2L7lk6tqhU/giphy.gif" width="480" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe it's much better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-all-the-code-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting all the code together
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the behavior easy to replicate, we can create a custom image component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CustomImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To fix lint warning &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/assets/image-error.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"blur"&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;blurDataURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/assets/image-placeholder.png"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a web application displays a lot of images,&lt;br&gt;
it is a good idea to give an immediate feedback to the user of what is happening. One way to address this is to use an alternate image to show the current state of an image.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don't go OpenAPI first, go API first</title>
      <author>Ivan Letenko</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 10:16:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/infobipdev/dont-go-openapi-first-go-api-first-bad</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/infobipdev/dont-go-openapi-first-go-api-first-bad</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that API first approach has been around for many years, interest in it does not decrease and new articles are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of interest thanks to the popularity of microservices and distributed systems, as well as actively growing as-a-Service solutions and add-ons marketplaces where developers can build and publish their applications and APIs on top platform's APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical articles and presentations on API-first mainly focus on the technical implementation and use of certain tools, such as back-end code generation from &lt;a href="https://www.openapis.org"&gt;OpenAPI specification&lt;/a&gt;, as well as rising interest to &lt;a href="https://www.asyncapi.com"&gt;AsyncAPI specification&lt;/a&gt; that brings standard to event-driven architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think it is important not to confuse goals and methods of achieving them; remember the basics of API first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-api%C2%A0first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is API first?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it is a development process and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about your API as a product for other developers even if it's an internal service. Apply agile development principles to the API design and definition. This allows us to establish a contract for how the API is supposed to behave. This contract is crucial because it improves the interaction of developers and allows you to get a system consisting of a reusable, and extensible building blocks, which brings a great value for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analogy is a test driven development (TDD), since it's also API first approach. Start with an interface, and the test will be the first consumer of your API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API contract itself can be specified in various ways which depend on the specifics of project and context.&lt;br&gt;
It could be an OpenAPI specification, request/response JSONs, or interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, at Infobip most of the services define their API through Java interfaces and data models, on the basis of which the OpenAPI specification is generated, if necessary.&lt;br&gt;
If you are designing an API for a web or mobile client of your service, design it as a product for external clients in order to avoid situations when you need to develop separate APIs for every new use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of an API first approach are similar to agile development processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast feedback that allows you to make adjustments earlier while the cost of change is low;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No constraints inherited from wrong abstractions &amp;amp; data models, you better understand customer needs by collaboratively discussing and adapting APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decoupling &amp;amp; parallelisation of work, teams can work independently having a common source of truth in the form of an API contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-code%C2%A0first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is code first?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a more traditional code first approach, the main functionality of the application is first developed and then an API for consumers and contributors is inserted on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works well only for small APIs, mainly internal, when requirements are clear and stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tools-amp-workshops-we-use-for-1600-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tools &amp;amp; Workshops We Use For 1600 Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see briefly how we deal with internal &amp;amp; external APIs at Infobip. Infobip is a global communication platform that consists of over 1.600 applications (service types) with hundreds of databases, data pipelines and support systems. More than 80 engineering teams work on. We have about 20 products that expose public APIs. At this scale it is vital for us to have reliable tools that synchronize and standardize service interactions while maintaining flexibility and speed of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, most of our internal services are written in Java or Kotlin. They expose their APIs as Java interfaces (we call them "connectors") and register them in home crafted remoting system. This system transparently builds HTTP APIs for inter-service communication. For non JVM services we use sidecar pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dependent services can just import "connectors" and use them without worrying about implementation. In this way, the contract is defined and development is completely independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For APIs that should be exposed publicly we use a solution based on &lt;a href="https://springdoc.org"&gt;springdoc-openapi&lt;/a&gt; that generates OpenAPI specification from Java/Kotlin classes. Non JVM services can expose OpenAPI specification by themselves on a dedicated endpoint. Thus, regardless of how the specification is created, it is a public contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that specification we generated &lt;a href="https://www.infobip.com/docs/api"&gt;public documentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.infobip.com/docs/sdk"&gt;client libraries&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="https://openapi-generator.tech"&gt;OpenAPI Generator&lt;/a&gt; based pipeline. Library generation also helps maintain the quality and stability of specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RA4KQ4ZR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/guv33em5dfiis21l5vh8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RA4KQ4ZR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/guv33em5dfiis21l5vh8.png" width="880" height="353"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;API docs &amp;amp; libs generation flow
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-works-for-us-at%C2%A0infobip"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Works For Us At Infobip
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on API design before development;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat your API as a public product;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools &amp;amp; workflows are secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, there is no need to dive into the complexity of OpenAPI right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAPI has essentially become an industry standard and it is easy to use as a common language between components that guarantees interoperability and simplifies API management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more on this topic give some likes &amp;amp; comments ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#javascript&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#webdev&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ allEqual&lt;br&gt;
This snippet checks whether all elements of the array are equal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;allEqual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ approximatelyEqual&lt;br&gt;
This snippet checks whether two numbers are approximately equal to each other, with a small difference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;approximatelyEqual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;epsilon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;epsilon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;approximatelyEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.5708&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ attempt&lt;br&gt;
This snippet executes a function, returning either the result or the caught error object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;attempt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;attempt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;gt;_&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;instanceof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// elements = []&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ bifurcateBy&lt;br&gt;
This snippet splits values into two groups, based on a predicate function. If the predicate function returns a truthy value, the element will be placed in the first group. Otherwise, it will be placed in the second group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Array.prototype.reduce()and Array.prototype.push()to add elements to groups, based on the value returned by fnfor each element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bifurcateBy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bifurcateBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;beep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;boop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ ['beep', 'boop', 'bar'], ['foo'] ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ bottomVisible&lt;br&gt;
This snippet checks whether the bottom of a page is visible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons for a startup to launch a clone app – a startup lacks experience, starts with a small budget and cannot afford to take big risks. In such a scenario, the safest option for a startup is to begin with a ready to use app. This way it won’t have to spend time, money and efforts on coding an app and fixing loads of bugs. A glitch-free user experience will definitely create and increase the customer base of your app. A startup can gain a lot by launching a clone app for their business customers.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Limited Cryptos: Remitano currently only supports 6 cryptocurrencies for deposits and withdrawals. These are among the largest cryptos by market cap, however.&lt;br&gt;
• No demo account: The easy-to-use platform, however, coupled with an FAQ section and responsive customer support team allows even the more novice investor to quickly become familiar with the features.&lt;br&gt;
• Unregulated: While unregulated, Remitano does require investors to go through a verification process in order to have access to higher trading limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrency Exchanges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huobi statistics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• 24h trading volume: $5,428,983,013&lt;br&gt;
• Rank: 6&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrencies listed: 350&lt;br&gt;
• Markets: 1048&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• More than 230 tradable assets&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Three different exchanges/trading platforms &lt;br&gt;
• Leveraged and margined trading&lt;br&gt;
• High-level of cybersecurity     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
• Account registration involves a lengthy procedure&lt;br&gt;
• Low withdrawal limits&lt;br&gt;
• Low leverage for margin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Crypto Margin Trading Exchanges&lt;br&gt;
• Cryptocurrency Exchanges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some differences:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Remitano: Unlike some other similarly sized crypto exchange platforms like Huobi, Remitano follows more stringent KYC checks, requiring users to go through a verification process before being able to trade in some cases. It is not uncommon to find trade orders on the platform that require ID verification to be done for your account. Unlike some other exchanges, Remitano does not support crypto options or futures trading.&lt;br&gt;
As a Customer Service &amp;amp; Support, Remitano offers 24/7 customer support via Intercom or Messenger, which you can easily access through the site. Additionally, the exchange offers forum functionality on its platform, allowing you to discuss crypto-related topics with other like-minded traders. The team also regularly updates the news portion of its forum. Any recent updates will be shown as a banner at the top of the site.&lt;br&gt;
As a Security, Remitano follows stringent security measures to ensure that you as a user are safe from any hack or exploit. The escrow service used by the platform ensures that sellers cannot scam buyers, as the funds are locked up and cannot be released without a successful trade or a dispute, which is handled by a member of the Remitano team.&lt;br&gt;
Huobi: As a Security, Huobi was never hacked, even though they do present a lucrative target for attackers, and we believe the exchange takes these threats seriously and does everything in their power to shield the exchange from hacks.&lt;br&gt;
To conclude, Huobi Global has managed to build a successful exchange platform, operating in the space for a long time with its reputation steadily increasing. The exchange offers a wide variety of coins to trade across many markets, and many users choose to place their funds and trust with the company, due to their proven track record, their impressive team, and their lucrative features outside the score of regular exchanges. While we do not agree with some business choices Huobi has made such as minting an exchange token, our rating remains impartial and Huobi certainly deserves a high score in the ultra-competitive crypto exchange landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-word"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last word:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remitano is best for low fees and as Customer Service &amp;amp; Support and access any Remitano marketplace, but Huobi is better for beginners and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the security factor is the first to consider, in fact, the most frequently asked question is whether Bittrex is safe. That the answer is yes, Bittrex is the most secure cryptocurrency exchange in the market.&lt;br&gt;
In this article we will learn about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radindev.com/bittrex-clone-script/"&gt;Bittrex clone script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, how does it work and its features in detail. So you will know everything about this exchange and its clone script. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FazQCIaE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j777aaazd0dfylpwm9d6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FazQCIaE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j777aaazd0dfylpwm9d6.png" alt="bittrex exchange" width="880" height="479"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-bittrex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About Bittrex
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bittrex is a cryptocurrency exchange, an exchange website that opened in 2014. It was born as a secure site that allows you to quickly execute orders with a quick and very simple interface. Unfortunately, despite good intentions, the security problems remain, like all exchanges, even Bittrex is subject to continuous cyber-attacks, which fortunately have not yet done serious damage. Unlike its main competitors, Bittrex's primary focus is trading. &lt;br&gt;
Let's see in detail what the Bittrex exchange is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features-available-in-bittrex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features available in Bittrex.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Two-Factor Authentication.&lt;br&gt;
• Multi-sig wallets.&lt;br&gt;
• Excellent security credentials.&lt;br&gt;
• Fast transactions and withdrawals.&lt;br&gt;
• Supports over 220 currencies.&lt;br&gt;
• Fiat deposits and withdrawals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize our review, let's list the main pros and cons of Bittrex.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Very intuitive platform&lt;br&gt;
• The site has never been hacked (for now)&lt;br&gt;
• There is also a smartphone app&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• High commissions&lt;br&gt;
• It is not possible to sell short (aim downwards)&lt;br&gt;
• There are no guarantees on deposited funds&lt;br&gt;
• Users have to wait a long time for a response from customer support&lt;br&gt;
• The verification process can take a long time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-bittrex-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Bittrex works?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To withdraw you must verify your identity, so we recommend doing it even before depositing, otherwise you risk having problems if the account cannot be activated.&lt;br&gt;
There are two types of accounts on Bittrex:&lt;br&gt;
Basic account: easier to verify and activate, imposes as a limit the right to withdraw no more than 3 BTC (once a day).&lt;br&gt;
Advanced account: has a more accurate verification process and allows you to withdraw up to 100 BTC (once a day).&lt;br&gt;
Bittrex also operates in the United States and this is an additional security factor, while in Europe it operates with the Bittrex Global platform, which is based in Liechtenstein.&lt;br&gt;
Bittrex supports over 190 cryptocurrencies, and this makes it a very complete exchange indeed.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, you will find everything you require to know about two of the United States’ most popular crypto exchanges, Bittrex and Coinbase. Even though both are quite commonly used, they serve very distinct purposes. And this is exactly what we’ll cover in this guide – what makes them different and why both are among the most preferred options when it comes to crypto exchanges.&lt;br&gt;
We have collected data and statistics on Coinbase and Bittrex. Read on below to find out more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bittrex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trading volume24h: $167.14 million&lt;br&gt;
Cryptocurrencies listed:    190&lt;br&gt;
The number of users: The exchange has over half a million active users.&lt;br&gt;
Market: 648&lt;br&gt;
Market share: 0.13%&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Coinbase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Trading volume24h: $5,494,590,361 26.21%&lt;br&gt;
Cryptocurrencies listed:    Coinbase supports more than 50 different cryptocurrencies.&lt;br&gt;
The number of users: Coinbase has 56 million users worldwide and over 2.8 million people actively exchange every month&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase generated over $1 billion in revenue in 2020, a 136 percent increase on 2019.&lt;br&gt;
Market share: %11&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase generated over $1 billion in revenue in 2020, a 136 percent increase on 2019&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase is the easier-to-use platform of the two. It’s particularly convenient for beginners because of the easy site navigation, as you won’t encounter difficult crypto trading terminology or graphs that could set you back.&lt;br&gt;
In comparison, Bittrex holds a reputation of being difficult to use. Nevertheless, some latest platform developments managed to make it more user-friendly. On its main dashboard, you’ll find a list of supported trading markets with price overviews, volume, and percentage of price changes during the last 24 hours. But even with this, it can’t compete with Coinbase. User-friendliness is where Coinbase surpasses Bittrex.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customer Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When it comes to customer support, both platforms have faced criticism regarding poor customer service. There’s a distinct support page for both Bittrex and Coinbase where you can access their FAQ section, guides, and handbooks. Both Coinbase and Bittrex offer customer support via email.&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase, however, currently does not offer any phone support with a live agent and only offers the option for phone support for emergency demands, but you must first submit an email request. Coinbase's users are content with the available options, saying 24-72 hours is what it takes them to reply.&lt;br&gt;
Unlike Coinbase, Bittrex has faced a good deal of criticism about the lack of a fast response when customers have reported major problems with their accounts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Trading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Both platforms offer a free-of-charge mobile app, accessible for download both on the Apple Store and Google Play Store. Once you are logged in, you can choose various markets, view charts, and place market orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-word"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last word
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is an excellent choice if you are looking for an easy way to get started with cryptocurrency, as it is secure and simple to use. But, if you are seeking more progressive trading options with lower fees, then we suggest Bittrex. And you can request for Bittrex clone script for starting your own business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Mobile and Web Apps with AWS</title>
      <author>Adit Modi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/introduction-to-mobile-and-web-apps-with-aws-4nm8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS offers a wide range of tools and services to support development workflows for iOS, Android, React Native, and web front-end developers. There is a set of services that make it easy to build, test, and deploy an application, even with minimal knowledge of AWS. With the speed and reliability of the AWS infrastructure, mobile and web applications can scale from prototype to millions of users to provide a better user experience and better solutions for the whole integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scalable approach allows you to grow your business quickly with built-in AWS best practices for security, availability, and reliability; your application can easily scale from one request per second with microsecond latency around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will discuss some of the most important AWS Mobile and Web App services that will help you in the development and operation of web and mobile solutions, as well as speed up the whole process and make it more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9KjEkrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ydtjtj9ozqwqb0cfv1u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9KjEkrD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ydtjtj9ozqwqb0cfv1u.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Introduction to AWS&lt;/strong&gt; is a Series containing different articles that provide a basic introduction to different aws topics/categories. Each article covers the detailed guide on how to work with particular topic/category . This series aims at providing "A Getting Started Guide on Different aws topics / categories ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-mobile-and-web-app-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Mobile and Web App Services
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS offers purpose-built tools and services for front-end web and mobile developers, which makes it easier to build apps with cloud functionality on AWS, so you can get to market faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS provides an end-to-end solution so you can develop, deliver, test, and monitor your app. you can also combine front-end tools with the breadth and depth of AWS services to support your evolving business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-amplify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Amplify
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3zRbpaPv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut2fjkku28ipz4cnylez.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3zRbpaPv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut2fjkku28ipz4cnylez.png" alt="image" width="140" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS Amplify makes it easy to create, configure, and implement scalable mobile applications powered by AWS. Amplify seamlessly provisions and manages your mobile backend and provides a simple framework to easily integrate your backend with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native frontends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amplify also automates the application release process of both your frontend and backend allowing you to deliver features faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile applications require cloud services for actions that can’t be done directly on the device, such as offline data synchronization, storage, or data sharing across multiple users. You often have to configure, set up, and manage multiple services to power the backend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also have to integrate each of those services into your application by writing multiple lines of code. However, as the number of application features grow, your code and release process becomes more complex and managing the backend requires more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amplify provisions and manages backends for your mobile applications. You just select the capabilities you need such as authentication, analytics, or offline data sync and Amplify will automatically provision and manage the AWS service that powers each of the capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then integrate those capabilities into your application through the Amplify libraries and UI components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-cognito"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Cognito
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QRcQ_cwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/udt25l9bfsm0i04d5hcg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QRcQ_cwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/udt25l9bfsm0i04d5hcg.png" alt="image" width="162" height="163"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the option to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Amazon Cognito enables you to save data locally on users’ devices, allowing your applications to work even when the devices are oﬄine. You can then synchronize data across users’ devices so that their app experience remains consistent regardless of the device they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Amazon Cognito, you can focus on creating great app experiences instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management, authentication, and sync across devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-pinpoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Pinpoint
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4eqhOaOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7i133ig560ohxkrowumf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4eqhOaOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7i133ig560ohxkrowumf.png" alt="image" width="138" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Pinpoint makes it easy to send targeted messages to your customers through multiple engagement channels. Examples of targeted campaigns are promotional alerts and customer retention campaigns, and transactional messages are messages such as order confirmations and password reset messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can integrate Amazon Pinpoint into your mobile and web apps to capture usage data to provide you with insight into how customers interact with your apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Pinpoint also tracks the ways that your customers respond to the messages you send—for example, by showing you the number of messages that were delivered, opened, or clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can develop custom audience segments and send them pre-scheduled targeted campaigns via email, SMS, and push notifications. Targeted campaigns are useful for sending promotional or educational content to re-engage and retain your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can send transactional messages using the console or the Amazon Pinpoint REST API. Transactional campaigns can be sent via email, SMS, push notifications, and voice messages. You can also use the API to build custom applications that deliver campaign and transactional messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-device-farm"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Device Farm is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time. View video, screenshots, logs, and performance data to pinpoint and fix issues before shipping your app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-location-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Location Service
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0q1cOBkp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bwu104erzc36axj1xw41.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0q1cOBkp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bwu104erzc36axj1xw41.png" alt="image" width="141" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Location Service provides affordable data, tracking and geofencing capabilities, and native integrations with AWS services, so you can create sophisticated location-enabled applications quickly, without the high cost of custom development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You retain control of your location data with Amazon Location, and you can combine proprietary data with data from the service. Amazon Location provides cost-effective location-based services (LBS) using high-quality data from global, trusted providers Esri and HERE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-chime-sdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Chime SDK
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MwwnE3K9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5jutojjxwydb5dyr9vx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MwwnE3K9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f5jutojjxwydb5dyr9vx.png" alt="image" width="159" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Chime SDK is a set of real-time communications components that developers can use to quickly add messaging, audio, video, and screen sharing capabilities to their web or mobile applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can leverage the same communication infrastructure and services that power Amazon Chime, an online meetings service from AWS, and deliver engaging experiences in their applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, they can add video to a health application so patients can consult with doctors on health issues remotely, or create customized audio prompts for integration with the public telephone network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the Amazon Chime SDK, developers can help eliminate the cost, complexity, and friction of creating and maintaining their own real-time communication infrastructure and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-app-runner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS App Runner
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6kQkC2wf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eoobx5kae5gmwaap8rxd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6kQkC2wf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eoobx5kae5gmwaap8rxd.png" alt="Image description" width="138" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs, at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required. Start with your source code or a container image. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Runner automatically builds and deploys the web application and load balances traffic with encryption. App Runner also scales up or down automatically to meet your traffic needs. With App Runner, rather than thinking about servers or scaling, you have more time to focus on your applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-appsync"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS AppSync
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wl_6QZ59--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tpdrt5oftfyfj1xpplo5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wl_6QZ59--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tpdrt5oftfyfj1xpplo5.png" alt="image" width="133" height="134"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync is a serverless back-end for mobile, web, and enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync makes it easy to build data driven mobile and web applications by handling securely all the application data management tasks like online and offline data access, data synchronization, and data manipulation across multiple data sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync uses GraphQL, an API query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax for describing their data requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon Location Service makes it easy for developers to add location functionality to applications without compromising data security and user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location data is a vital ingredient in today’s applications, enabling capabilities ranging from asset tracking to location-based marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, developers face significant barriers when integrating location functionality into their applications. This includes cost, privacy and security compromises, and tedious and slow integration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the development of mobile and web applications is closely related to cloud services in the form of a backend. The bulk of functionality in mobile and web applications is designed to communicate with the backend and to make calls to the corresponding API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s system to develop mobile applications is constantly being updated with interesting functions. It also offers an authentication system, the ability to quickly build flexible APIs via GraphQL, and the ability to test in the cloud using real devices, which is essential for testers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this guide gives you an Introduction to Mobile and Web Apps with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boost Your Efficiency: Top 5 Productivity Plugins For Dev Teams 🔥🔥🔥
</title>
      <author>Barbara Lavigne</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 09:39:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/barbara66871045/boost-your-efficiency-top-5-productivity-plugins-for-dev-teams-369p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/barbara66871045/boost-your-efficiency-top-5-productivity-plugins-for-dev-teams-369p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is your team as productive as can be? We tend to be most productive while using tools we know and like best, that’s why in the majority of dev teams you’re free to code with your weapon of choice (aka IDE). So no matter if you’re utterly loyal to VS Code or you’re a die-hard-JetBrains: these 5 cross-IDE tools are definitely worth checking out!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gitlive-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitLive for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamHub.teamhub"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11955-gitlive"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming your team uses Git then GitLive is a no-brainer enhancement of your IDE’s built-in Git functionality. Once installed it adds a team view showing all work in progress for each collaborator from your Git repository. Any non-stale branch ahead of master/main is considered work in progress and you can inspect diffs of the files changed as well as view the associated issue or pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y_MXRQus--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637067038956/EV-sykzcsg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y_MXRQus--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1637067038956/EV-sykzcsg.png" alt="image (5).png" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my favourite feature is probably the automatic merge conflict detection. The difference between your local changes and the work in progress of your teammates is shown for your current open file in the gutter of your editor. It shows you the type of change (addition, deletion, modification or conflict) and you can inspect it to see the diff, what branch it's from and even cherry-pick into your local file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
GitLive can be very useful for larger teams and especially useful for open or inner source projects as these features even work across forks. What’s also cool is as the data comes straight from Git, there’s no manual entry required to keep it up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tabnine-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tabnine for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12798-tabnine-ai-code-completion-js-java-python-ts-rust-go-php--more"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of ways to speed up your coding? Tabnine might be exactly what you’re looking for. It's an AI code completion tool that indexes your code and finds statistical patterns to create customized suggestions based on how you write your own code. It allows you to code faster with fewer syntax errors and more code snippets to look into right in your IDE. It gets better with time as it gains more material to analyse, both if you work solo or in a team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin supports most popular languages, libraries, and frameworks, including Python, Javascript, Java, React, Vue, Rust Typescript, PHP, Angular, C / C++/ C# and Kotlin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NEjWlbHS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634224504302/K2icWaZhj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NEjWlbHS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634224504302/K2icWaZhj.png" alt="tabnine.png" width="880" height="530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabnine comes in a pro version for bigger teams that uses an advanced AI model and a basic version based on a smaller AI model. Both versions also support Team Trained AI (trained and run locally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
Tabnine Teams is trained on your team’s projects, preferences, and patterns. Every interaction improves AI accuracy, bringing its value to the whole team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stepsize-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stepsize for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stepsize.stepsize"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14515-issue-tracker-in-ide"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the health of your codebase requires effort from the whole team and Stepsize is an example of a tool that can save you time spent on tracking and addressing potential problems. It’s an issue tracker inside your editor for managing technical debt and maintenance issues. Sometimes while coding we encounter issues that need fixing, but don’t have time to do it straight away. Thanks to this handy plugin you can bookmark code and create TODOs straight in your IDE without affecting your workflow! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z22caAYu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223594148/uhJrGdX0I.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z22caAYu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223594148/uhJrGdX0I.gif" alt="stepsize.gif" width="800" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
The plugin makes it easy to collaborate with your teammates on maintenance and refactoring work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#editorconfig-for-vs-code-or-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  EditorConfig for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig/versions"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EditorConfig is a great help when it comes to maintaining consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the most built-in language-specific formatters, EditorConfig's settings apply to all kinds of files, clearing git diff of trailing whitespace, newlines or indentation characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---15ae9aF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223746549/JLKUyZprM.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---15ae9aF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223746549/JLKUyZprM.jpeg" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-12 at 10.43.54.jpeg" width="880" height="592"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
The extension automatically sets the correct IDE settings for each project you switch into, so every developer working on the project will write code in the same style. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-comments-for-vs-code-and-jetbrains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better Comments for &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10850-better-comments"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin is an example of how a very simple idea can improve the quality of our work. It’s an effective and customisable extension that takes care of creating “human-friendly” (more readable and organised) comments in your code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can categorise your annotations into: Alerts, Queries, TODOs and Highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hrBJXaH7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223548861/-uahqW1S1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hrBJXaH7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634223548861/-uahqW1S1.png" alt="better-comments.png" width="459" height="414"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes with default comment styles, but any other comment styles can be specified in the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity boost&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;br&gt;
Immediately spot important TODOs in your code, so nothing gets overlooked!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope some of the awesome plugins I rounded up in this post will make your team collaboration faster, more efficient and productive. Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>📚🏆 Top 20 Web Development Learning Resources: From Beginner to Advanced</title>
      <author>Alex Omeyer</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development"&gt;Web development&lt;/a&gt; refers to the act of building and maintaining websites; these websites can range in complexity from simple static websites to more complex web applications with huge databases, real-time data-intensive applications such as social media and eCommerce applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back-end developers&lt;/strong&gt; designs the application APIs and databases schemas and implements the business logic. Backend developers were originally referred to as developers back in the days when front-end development was considered to be trivial work. Backend developers can employ a wide range of languages to achieve their needs. A backend developer would be skilled in languages such as PHP, Java, Python, ASP.net, Ruby, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-end developers&lt;/strong&gt; consume the APIs and implement the logic to handle a website’s presentation,  interactivity, and user experience. Unlike backend, the front-end developer’s main scripting language is JavaScript. However, there is an overwhelming amount of JavaScript frameworks, libraries, bundlers, and build tools available for front-end development. And oftentimes a front-end developer is specialised in one or more of these. Some examples of these front-end technologies are React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Webpack, Rollup, Snowpack, ESbuild, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides JavaScript, front-end developers also use HTML and CSS to both structure and beautify a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-stack developers&lt;/strong&gt; are developers who has both front-end and back-end development skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the area of specialisation, good developers follow the &lt;a href="https://www.stepsize.com/blog/how-to-be-an-effective-boy-girl-scout-engineer?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;boy/girl scout rule&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;always leave the code better than you found it&lt;/strong&gt;. And they achieve this by using &lt;a href="https://dev.to/alexomeyer/10-must-have-vs-code-extensions-to-improve-your-productivity-4goe"&gt;tools that enhance productivity&lt;/a&gt;, improve code quality, foster collaboration, and manage technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development is a highly paid skill that is currently in great demand.With the advent of Covid, many businesses and services are moving online; thereby, increasing the need for web developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, now is the best time to learn web development—let's look at the websites and online platforms to learn software development!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-road-map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://roadmap.sh/"&gt;1. Road Map&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning web development is a journey and for this, you would need a road map. One of the biggest challenges faced by new developers when learning web development is not knowing where to start, what to learn, or the path to achieve their goals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roadmap.sh is a community effort to create roadmaps, guides, and other educational content to help guide the developers in picking up the path and guide their learnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read map provides downloadable visual guides containing topics, tools, languages, and all the required niceties to guide a noob developer in his journey to web development mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
