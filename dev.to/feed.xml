      <title>How to Prevent Burnout While Working as a Web Developer</title>
      <author>Creative Tim</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most web developers start coding out of pure passion and later on turn it into a career. They usually learn to code on their own and then start working as a freelance web developer or as an employed web developer in a company. Whichever route they choose, they work hard and pull all-nighters or do overtime work to build the career they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though they start with drive and motivation to learn more and become better at programming, there might come a time where the passion for coding fades, and programming becomes overwhelming and stressful. If these symptoms persist and affect work life and personal life, they may point to burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer or programmer burnout is a widespread phenomenon in the fast-paced IT industry. The web developer job comes with very high demands, so most programmers face it at least once in their career. If this sounds familiar to you, read our article to discover how to deal with burnout and prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-developer-burnout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What Is Developer Burnout?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer/programmer burnout is a state of mental and physical exhaustion caused by extreme work-related stress. It is characterized by symptoms such as losing motivation and interest in work, mental and physical fatigue, and a cynical or critical attitude towards work. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurathomas/2020/08/28/its-time-to-face-facts-burnout-is-rampant/?sh=7041e4713861"&gt;Burnout has become more common&lt;/a&gt; and exacerbated since the Coronavirus pandemic started, due to the fact that most people are working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is work-related, burnout can affect various aspects of your life, such as your family life, your health, or your friendships. You should identify burnout as soon as possible and take all necessary measures to recover from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0ZcvYxVp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tim-gouw-1K9T5YiZ2WU-unsplash-1024x685.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0ZcvYxVp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tim-gouw-1K9T5YiZ2WU-unsplash-1024x685.jpg" alt="Burnout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-you-identify-developer-burnout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;How Can You Identify Developer Burnout?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the most common symptoms associated with developer/programmer burnout. Keep in mind that you can get all of them, some of them or none at all. The burnout phenomenon manifests itself differently for each person. To qualify as burnout symptoms, these things need to happen for a longer period of time (like weeks, months, or even years), not just for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Loss of motivation and passion for coding.&lt;/strong&gt; This symptom is very common, and most times, it is the first sign of developer burnout. If you notice that you don’t have the same motivation and passion you did when you first started coding, you could be on the verge of burning out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mental and physical fatigue.&lt;/strong&gt; You feel constantly drained and have no energy to code or even do other everyday activities. Physical and emotional exhaustion might be a sign of burnout rearing its ugly head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Feelings of isolation.&lt;/strong&gt; Because you feel overwhelmed and exhausted by your job, you start distancing yourself from other people. Social isolation translates into loneliness, which can aggravate burnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Feelings of depression and anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt; These feelings are usually related to coding and your job, but you can notice them around other aspects of your life as well. If you want to find out more about how developers can deal with anxiety, &lt;a href="https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/education/web-developers-can-beat-anxiety/"&gt;read our dedicated article on this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Reduced work performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Burnout causes difficulty in concentrating, which can notably affect work performance. This can, in turn, lead to a lack of accomplishment and feelings of ineffectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cynicism and Alienation from work.&lt;/strong&gt; This translates into indifference to work-related activities and emotionally distancing yourself from your job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Physical symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt; Some developers may manifest physical burnout symptoms such as headaches or stomachaches. They are usually caused by the massive amount of stress they are dealing with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-burnout-causes-for-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What Are the Burnout Causes for Developers?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the unhealthy habits and circumstances that can lead to developer burnout. If you catch yourself experiencing these things regularly, you might burnout soon. Try to keep an eye out for these causes and counter their effects on your mind and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending 8-10 hours per day in front of the computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a very unhealthy habit, and it is a decisive factor in burning out. You could do this willingly to impress your superiors and advance in your career or take up as many freelancing development projects as possible to earn more money. No matter the reason, beware that overloading yourself with tasks and spending most of the day coding can eventually lead to burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f2xPAK-R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/burnout02.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f2xPAK-R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/burnout02.jpg" alt="Spending hours in front of the computer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a mundane coding job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If your job requires you to write the same code every day, use the same software and do the same activities, you’ll soon start feeling stuck. Your mind needs constant challenges so it can preserve its motivation and drive. Feeling like you’re never going to progress in your career is also directly linked to developer burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being isolated from other people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is both a cause and a symptom. Being a web developer is a lonely career, even more so in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. As a developer, you usually have meetings to decide the course of action, but you do all the work by yourself in front of the computer. Coding together with someone at the same computer, also known as pair programming, can happen from time to time, but it’s not a technique used often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing your mind every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Web development is a mentally demanding job because it requires you to solve complex problems daily. Straining your mind for extended periods will drain your mind and lead to mental fatigue, which is a burnout symptom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of exercise and sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s as the Romans used to say, “mens sana in corpore sano” (which translates as “a healthy mind in a healthy body”). If you don’t get enough sleep and exercise regularly, you will not be in your best form, physically or mentally. Having an unhealthy body makes it much easier for burnout to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-you-prevent-developer-burnout-and-recover-from-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;How Can You Prevent Developer Burnout and Recover From It?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must be aware that burnout is a common phenomenon in the web development field. However, there are simple &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/09/05/how-to-manage-stress-as-a-developer-syndication/"&gt;things you can do to manage stress&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind there isn’t a one-size-fits-all recipe on how to avoid burnout or recover from it, but there are some guidelines that you can follow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JqLYgVcK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/manny-pantoja-10bgCz0qkto-unsplash-768x1152.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JqLYgVcK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/manny-pantoja-10bgCz0qkto-unsplash-768x1152.jpg" alt="manage stress"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take breaks throughout the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t sit in the same position for 8 to 10 hours straight. Make sure you take a 10 minutes break every hour to stretch and look away from the computer. Take an hour-long lunch break or even go for a quick. If your job does not allow this, it could be an indicator they don’t care about their programmers’ well-being, and you should consider looking for a different one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep things fresh at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This way, you can hold on to your motivation and drive. Don’t despair if you have a monotonous coding job that keeps you using the same technologies repeatedly. There are several things you can do. You could try talking to your superior and maybe switch projects or take on different responsibilities. If this is not an option, you can do coding projects that feed your motivation in your free time (e.g., try a new programming language, learn new tools, build an open-source project, and so on). Ultimately, you should consider changing jobs if this is something you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a long break from time to time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ideally, it would help if you went on a week-long vacation every few months. This way, you can relax and disconnect from coding. Start slow when you come back to coding. Don’t jump back into an 8 to 10 hours programming schedule.&lt;br&gt;
If you can’t go on vacation, find something else that you enjoy, like a hobby that takes up a considerable amount of time and helps you unwind. Whatever it is that interests you will help you. If you are trying to recover from burnout, maybe you should try stress-reducing activities such as yoga or meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be around other people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you are married and have children, spend time with your significant other and your kids. Hang out with friends and other acquaintances. This way, you can balance the feelings of isolation you have at work with quality time spent with people you care about in your free time.&lt;br&gt;
Your life outside of work is important, and you should never neglect it. The support of your loved ones is precious, especially in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/pieohpah/dealing-with-programmers-burnout-40b"&gt;dealing with burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise and get enough sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Regular physical activity can help you better deal with stress. It is also a great way to keep your mind busy and off work. Getting enough sleep restores well-being is &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2010/01000/The_Cost_of_Poor_Sleep__Workplace_Productivity.13.aspx"&gt;directly linked to productivity&lt;/a&gt;. A healthy mind and body won’t get burned out as easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#practical-advice-from-our-team"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Practical advice from our team&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve covered all the theoretical guidelines on dealing with burnout, it’s time for some practical advice. We talked with our team to get insights on how they prevent and manage burnout. Here’s what we found out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexandru, Creative Tim Co-Founder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’ve experienced burnout for multiple months in a row after having worked long periods. Now I usually stop working at 7-8 PM and move my attention to reading and listening to calm/Tibetan music (on apps like Headspace or Youtube). I also take 4-5 days of vacation every 1-2 months. Once a week, I smoke a cigar, which decreases my anxiety level for the next 2-3 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beni, Full-Stack Developer at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What works for me is taking breaks throughout the day and listening to music. I also take short periods off work once in a while. During my days off, I enjoy traveling and discovering new places. Hiking is also a relaxing activity that I try to do as often as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragoș, Front-End Developer at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Going to the gym is what helps me avoid developer burnout. I go daily and have been doing this for quite some time. Sometimes I go in the morning, so I am ready for a new day of coding, and sometimes I go in the evening to unwind after a full day at the office. Either way, sport relaxes me and keeps my mind off work. It also helps me focus and be present in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rareș, Front-End Developer at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What helps me keep burnout at bay is working on my personal web development projects. I always have side projects and coding experiments because they are fun and a great way to gain new coding skills that I can also use at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manu, React Developer at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“One of the small things I do to prevent burnout is to take a 5-minute break every hour, in which I do some physical exercises (abs, pushups, or squats). I also enjoy reading self-development books, so often after work, I pick up a book and dive into it for half an hour to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ștefan, Front-End Developer at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m trying to find a balance between the work hours and my personal life. I usually spend time in nature as a proactive person or practicing swimming, cycling, or other activities like reading to avoid burnout. “Mens sana in corpore sano”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexandra, Marketing Manager at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Cooking is what gets my stress away. The launch break is my “Zen” time because I get to try new recipes almost daily, which makes me relaxed. I’ve forgotten about food delivery, especially since the pandemic started and I’m working from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ana, Growth Marketer at Creative Tim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I use a Pomodoro timer to take short breaks throughout the day. After hours I like to relax by practicing yoga or meditating. I also try to take days off once in a while to unwind, maybe go on a city break or visit nearby sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope now that you know more about developer burnout, you will be more mindful about your well-being at work, and keep an eye out for potential burnout symptoms. Since it’s better to prevent than to “treat”, make sure you follow our guidelines from the last part of the article to achieve a healthy work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should create a developer Instagram account</title>
      <author>Andrew Baisden</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 12:24:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/why-you-should-create-a-developer-instagram-account-35m2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/why-you-should-create-a-developer-instagram-account-35m2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instagram needs no introduction everyone knows how big it is. It is one of the most popular and active social media platforms in the world. In fact it is even bigger than Twitter which is why it is so good for building your brand and growing followers. However many developers avoid it completely because Instagram is predominantly an image based social network whereas Twitter is text based which is more ideal for talking and sharing code. I think its a missed opportunity though because if you are working on building your network and growing your audience then obviously you should be on Instagram it is just too huge to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some people Instagram can feel a bit weird because lets face it the platform is mostly all visuals and you would go on there expecting to see pictures of people, locations, food etc... Having pictures of code is just not quite the same is it? But if you step back and take a look at the big picture you will realise that there are multiple ways for you to engage with people on Instagram. First let's break it down. This is my own opinion here but I think there are at least 7 types of developer related Instagram accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image links to blog articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal selfies and computer setups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joke/Meme Illustrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS Art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you can see there are actually a lot of opportunities for growth there. Ideally you would want to create a new business account for your developer work so that you do not contaminate your main personal instagram with too much developer focused work that your friends and family might not understand. It is just easier to have a branded channel for that content. I recently created a tech focused Instagram account for myself this month and it seems to be doing well at the moment. I still need to work on being more active but I have plenty of ideas based on the type of developer related accounts out there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to post even some of that content then you will grow an audience. So far I have had quite good engagements even though I have put little effort in so far. I have even gained more than 30 followers already at this rate it will surpass my personal Instagram which I should really be more active on. Coronavirus has not really helped much with so much indoor time due to having 2 years of lockdowns 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many developers and communities are already using Instagram. DEV, Hashnode and CodeNewbie already have a presence on there among others. Each of them have thousands of followers already so use that as motivation you are also capable of building an audience on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my developer Instagram account &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewbaisden_tech/"&gt;andrewbaisden_tech&lt;/a&gt; I hope to see more of you on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope that you enjoyed reading this article and learned something from it. As a content creator and technical writer I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping other people reach their goals. Let's connect across social media you can find all of my social media profiles and blogs on &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewbaisden"&gt;linktree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace ✌️&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's talk about impostor syndrome 😧</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello folks! Welcome back 👋🏻 I trust you are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably figured from the title, today I'd like to talk about impostor syndrome. I know what you're thinking: "Ah, another one of these posts... Bye 🙄". Just hear me out before you leave. I promise I won't make it too long (at least not 30 minutes long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚨 DISCLAIMER #1&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Be warned; this one sounds like a rant. Not suitable for the faint at heart. Proceed at your own risk or hit the back button before you regret it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#brief-intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Brief intro ✍🏻
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been wanting to write about this topic for a while now, but I just couldn't find the words to approach this topic. After a conversation with &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/theowlsden"&gt;@theowlsden&lt;/a&gt;
 , I finally got the clarity I need it, and here I am, finally writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's settle this topic once and for all, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-impostor-syndrome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is impostor syndrome? 🤔
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So sorry to reiterate this point here, but I need a baseline. For those unfamiliar with the term, here's a definition I found on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their skills, talents or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the definition above, impostor syndrome is entirely mental and often fictitious. I personally believe that those experiencing it or those who have experienced it, are to blame for feeling this way (this includes me too). What I mean by this is that we effectively engage in self-sabotaging activities, therefore increasing the likelihood of falling victim to impostor syndrome. We literally bring this upon ourselves with our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XPbxBfBP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette.wikia.nocookie.net%252Famong-us%252Fimages%252Fd%252Fd7%252FAmong.png%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20200603164334%2526path-prefix%253Dpt-br%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XPbxBfBP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fvignette.wikia.nocookie.net%252Famong-us%252Fimages%252Fd%252Fd7%252FAmong.png%252Frevision%252Flatest%253Fcb%253D20200603164334%2526path-prefix%253Dpt-br%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="impostor: me"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let me be very clear about one thing: impostor syndrome !== self-doubt! I've heard and seen some folks say that impostor syndrome is not real and that it is just a fancy term used to refer to self-doubt. I don't agree in the least with such statement. In fact, I am under the impression that the folks making such statement, have not experienced impostor syndrome. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I personally believe that self-doubt is merely a part of what makes up impostor syndrome as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next sections, I'll be sharing with you what I believe are key contributors to impostor syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

If you are struggling with mental health issues, please consider seeking help from a professional. This blog is not intended to serve as medical advice. Proceed at your own discretion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unrealistic-expectations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1️⃣ Unrealistic expectations 💭
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations, we all have them, yet they are not inherently bad in nature. Having expectations is good to some extent, so long they are realistic. Unrealistic expectations are the key ingredient for disappointment and do far more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you just landed a great job and things are going great. However, on one good day, your inner impostor rises and takes control. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J1S4t3Jx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fi.imgur.com%252FEUXxEy1.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J1S4t3Jx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fi.imgur.com%252FEUXxEy1.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="I'm the captain now"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly you expect yourself to know everything, to not have to ask anyone for help, to seem and be competent at all times. All you do is create expectations for yourself. You think (and want to believe) that these expectations are being forced on you by others, when in reality, it's all your doing. You played yourself! You set such unattainable expectations for yourself and consequently ended up getting disappointed the moment you couldn't meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's my two cents&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;accept that you will never know it all. Accept that it is okay to ask for help, to not have the answer to all questions. Be okay with admitting that you don't know, with saying: "I'm stuck, I need help". There is nothing wrong with acknowledging your knowledge and/or skill gaps. You are here to learn. What you don't know today, you'll know someday not too far in the future. So, go easy on the expectations and set them straight, for good!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-yourself-to-others"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2️⃣ Comparing yourself to others 😢
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the drill: you hop on your social media of choice and scroll through your feed until you are almost brain dead. Awesome! While scrolling through your feed, you see all these awesome folks you look up to. You can't help but think one (or all) of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Oh, X is so cool! I wish I could be like them..." &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Man, how I wish I had that many followers..." &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Damn, I'd love to work for Y; that's my dream company! X is so lucky to be working there... I hope I can make it to Y one day..." &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, WILL YOU?! 😡 Nothing infuriates me more than to see and hear people lament about how unsuccessful they are when COMPARED to others. Gee, focus on your damn self! Stop looking left and right for people to measure yourself up to! Nothing wrong with admiring someone, but never EVER compare yourself to them. You are two different people, with different qualities (strengths, weaknesses, skills etc.) and different life circumstances. Feeling sorry for yourself will get you NO WHERE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in for a bit, okay? And don't blame social media for how YOU feel when using it. Sure, social media is pretty evilly engineered, but YOU choose how much time you spend on it and doing what. If it makes you feel so bad about yourself, why are you spending so much time on it? Are you a masochist by any chance? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on your journey and your journey alone. Notice how I say journey here. It's not a race by any means. It's not about how fast you go and how famous you get. Slow but steady is fine. Progress is progress. Stop getting distracted by other people's success and focus on YOURSELF. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bk_9os4C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.pinimg.com%252Foriginals%252Fac%252Fa7%252F9a%252Faca79afcd13bdcecdd974f864d187211.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bk_9os4C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.pinimg.com%252Foriginals%252Fac%252Fa7%252F9a%252Faca79afcd13bdcecdd974f864d187211.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="nice quote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;most people don't share their failure stories on the net. They typically feed their audience the feel-good and badass content. You choose if you want to keep indulging and getting deluded by these one-sided fables. 🤷🏻‍♀️&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-accepting-that-you-are-a-beginner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3️⃣ Not accepting that you are a beginner 😕
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is closely related to setting unrealistic expectations. I see many skip the beginner phase. They never state a role they held with the word junior on their resume (they typically omit the word junior altogether). Why would they, right? Everyone's a senior dev straight out of college/uni/bootcamp, RIGHT? Obviously not! 🙄 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ignoring your humble beginnings, you don't help yourself. You just corner yourself further and make the encounter with your inner impostor more inevitable (just like Thanos 😉). At this point, you are already falling in the vicious circle that is setting unrealistic expectations. By not acknowledging where you are currently standing in your career you'll wind up expecting yourself to be at a level much higher than the one you are currently on. To top it all, you'll get in the way of your growth, both personal and professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To all the newbies (or otherwise) out there&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;come to terms with the fact that you are just getting started. Stop trying to be a freaking senior dev since day one. Embrace the journey, welcome the struggle. Failing to accept where you are currently standing in your career will only get in your way. You have been warned...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-dont-give-yourself-enough-credit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4️⃣ You don't give yourself enough credit 🏅
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You accomplish something? You don't acknowledge it. You hit a milestone? You don't celebrate that win. People compliment your work? You invalidate their compliment. See? I was right. All you do is self-sabotage! You get in your own way over and over and over again. Yet somehow, you hope you'll feel better about yourself by engaging in these destructive behaviors. Truly delusional...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all you do is keep yourself small, how do you expect to grow? Take pride in what you do and have accomplished and continue building on top of it. Change your mindset (especially how you see yourself and think about yourself) and notice how everything around you starts changing too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My message here is clear&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;GIVE 👏🏻 YOURSELF 👏🏻 MORE 👏🏻 CREDIT 👏🏻. Take that compliment. Celebrate that win. Know that what you have done up until now has value, no matter how small an achievement it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yg950r4R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.pinimg.com%252Foriginals%252F9e%252F28%252F6f%252F9e286f7d0fce9089446917e6664d0312.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yg950r4R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi.pinimg.com%252Foriginals%252F9e%252F28%252F6f%252F9e286f7d0fce9089446917e6664d0312.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="old ways won't open new doors"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The end 🙌🏻
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray, you made it this far down! 🎉 Thanks for tuning in for this one. Smash that 💖 or 🦄 if you believe this should have been a TEDx speech. Just kidding! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly hope that you could take away something from this rant (if not you may want to read this again 🤭). I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic, so don't hesitate to drop them below. Let's keep it civil and constructive, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, say your goodbyes to your inner impostor!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yo! you want to get started with robotics but don't know the road map to follow</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/comejoinfolks/yo-you-want-to-get-started-with-robotics-but-don-t-know-the-road-map-to-follow-4358</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get ready to roll up your sleeves because i got you covered .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#firstly-what-is-robotics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Firstly: what is Robotics
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotics in lame man's term is using machine to perform  task that can be done by human being. Your phone is typically a robot because it can perform calculations  like adding , subtraction of two numbers which you can essentially do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotics is making  machine that thinks like you. Robots are widely used in industries to perform simple repetitive task. Tesla cars is typically an example of automobiles robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-you-think-robotics-is-worth-learning-in-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do you think robotics is worth learning in 2021.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to dive in into robotics  because of the monetary aspect  well this if for you according to glassdoor the average salary is ..... Whao! That's a huge money there .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s98IXcT8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619692628981/GARJRupKb.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s98IXcT8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619692628981/GARJRupKb.jpeg" alt="20210429_113637.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-programming-should-i-learn-for-robotics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What programming should I learn for robotics.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wanted to start my robotics software engineering career I was pondering  on what programming to learn because there were lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But heads up! *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  I got you covered here are the 3 core programming languages you need to know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;c language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;c++ language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-python"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. python:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Python!. python as far as I'm concerned is one of the simplest  language to learn. It as a lot of libraries  for robotics  with less coding  compared to c and c++. Python is intuitive and easy for newbies  starting their career in robotics. Python is used in raspberry pi and can also be used with ROS(robotics operating system)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###2. C language:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why C!. A lot of hardware libraries are used in robotics are written in C this libraries allow  interaction  with low level hardware and real time performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-c"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. C++:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why C++! The main reason is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory management. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will drop  resources for these programming languages listed above  mostly free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-i-need-to-get-stucked-with-mathematics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do I need to get stucked with  Mathematics.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematics is one of the main reason people don't want to dive in into robotics. You don't need much mathematics to start with robotics. All you need is your high school or basic knowledge in algebra after that your advancement in robotics will require you to learn &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#these-are-the-step-by-step-road-map-i-wished-i-had-followed-before-now-to-build-your-career-in-robotics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  These are the step by step road map I wished I had followed before now to build your career in robotics
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-learn-3-core-programming-languages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Learn 3 core programming languages
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C language &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start with the first two so you will be able to do hands on project like arduino and raspberry pi &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-learn-mechatronic"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Learn  mechatronic
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechatronic is a cool stuff to start with as an hands on project I know you might be thinking well I don't know anything about mechatronic.  *&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But folks! *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you better want to start with with something rather than nothing  and to make life easier for you start with *&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arduino and Raspberry pi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Arduino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;* is an open source electronic prototyping platform enabling user to create  interactive electronic projects.  You will need the basic knowledge of *&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;C language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;* to start with arduino you can buy the arduino kit online at amazon or other ecommerce websites &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jc4g9V2B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619694950015/fuaqb7BQA.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jc4g9V2B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619694950015/fuaqb7BQA.jpeg" alt="20210429_121520.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Raspberry pi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;* is a tiny  and affordable computer that you can use to learn programming through practical projects. You will need *&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;python or c++&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;* to start with raspberry pi &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article will be continued *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As developers, it often feels like all of our time is spent wading through huge file trees, fixing failing test cases, waiting for code reviews and having meetings. What we want is a smooth flow for understanding what code &lt;em&gt;actually does&lt;/em&gt;, which code is &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; to what we’re doing, and we want to be able to &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; as much knowledge as possible with our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WQ1lXJus--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/83x5wbeptx770h3xq4a2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WQ1lXJus--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/83x5wbeptx770h3xq4a2.png" alt="How AppMap works"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 10 minute video, I describe how autogenerated, interactive code maps can improve team communication and productivity. I focus on AppMap, an open source framework that “drives the back roads of your application”, records code execution into JSON files, and generates interactive diagrams and useful code analysis -- right in your code editor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, you'll see how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record AppMaps from running code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance issue descriptions with AppMaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use AppMaps to gain context and understanding of an issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use AppMaps in pull/merge request to show the reviewer how your code works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better information about code behavior and design helps to lighten the load of code review, and helps your team deliver your best quality software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about AppMaps, see:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JS interview in 2 minutes / Inheritance in OOP</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/kozlovzxc/js-interview-in-2-minutes-inheritance-in-oop-53h2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;// It may be worth to read previous part first&lt;br&gt;
// &lt;a href="https://dev.to/kozlovzxc/js-interview-in-2-minutes-object-oriented-programming-oop-3443"&gt;JS interview in 2 minutes / Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is Inheritance in OOP? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Inheritance is a way to modify or extend parent class in child class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longer answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let's see what we've got in the previous post and try to extend it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isGood&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bark!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;barkInEnglish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Hello my friend! My name is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we have a working dog's profile, but what if we need to add a cat's profile? It would be a bit different because good or bad terminology is not applicable to cats, they are above these measurements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  name: 'Fluffer',
  age: 2,
  isFluffer: true,
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copying and modifying the &lt;code&gt;DogProfile&lt;/code&gt; class would be weird since we will need to maintain two almost exact copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inheritance to the rescue! We can move shared functionality to some standalone class and just inherit &lt;code&gt;DogProfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CatProfile&lt;/code&gt; from the new &lt;code&gt;BaseProfile&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BaseProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BaseProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isGood&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bark!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;barkInEnglish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Hello my friend! My name is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CatProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BaseProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isFluffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isFluffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isFluffer&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;meow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Meow!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doggert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DogProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Doggert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doggert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;barkInEnglish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fluffert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CatProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Fluffert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fluffert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;meow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome, like this, we can create any new profile type without much effort and every new class will only have new fields and methods which are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/pO4UHglOY2vII/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/pO4UHglOY2vII/giphy.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-life applications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue with Inheritance is that if you don't plan few steps ahead, you may end up in mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible type of issue is when inheritance doesn't actually describe data relations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Duck&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Plane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Duck&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Forbidding quacking...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;quack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;DO I LOOK LIKE A DUCK TO YOU?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This won't be a very reliable &lt;code&gt;Plane&lt;/code&gt; to fly on. Imagine someone will update &lt;code&gt;Duck&lt;/code&gt; fly methods with a time limit after it gets tired. The plane will get tired and return to the nest as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4FJceCtA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q08imjmw4xun52jc18rr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4FJceCtA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q08imjmw4xun52jc18rr.png" alt="Untitled_Artwork"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible issue is when you have complex data and there are more than 9000 levels of classes nesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// I saw this once, it was terrible 😱&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NamedProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProfileWithRoles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NamedProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AdminProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ProfileWithRoles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Things can get much worse if you end up using multiple inheritances without any control&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29879267/es6-class-multiple-inheritance/45332959&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a way to play around with this issue using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA"&gt;composition over inheritance&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns"&gt;design patterns&lt;/a&gt;. I will try to cover them in the following posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>How to use git</title>
      <author>MD Rashid Hussain</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GIT - The easiest method (in a summary)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repo on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone that remote repo on local PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write/code whatever in that folder (repo you cloned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push to remote repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----Details-----&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, step 1&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; Create a GitHub account&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; Create new repository&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; public/private (whatever you want)&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; add readme (if you want)&lt;br&gt;
Create repo&lt;br&gt;
Now your repo is created&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2 (cloning)&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; go inside your repo and click on the green button (with a download kind of sign and code written on it)&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; that will create a link, copy that link&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; open your folder where you want to keep this folder(repo)&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; right click --&amp;gt; open git bash&lt;br&gt;
--&amp;gt; git clone "theLinkYouCopied"&lt;br&gt;
(Link must be in quotes)&lt;br&gt;
Now cloned, and since you copied from GitHub, git is already initialised in this repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3 (that you do yourself, the productivity part) The usual coding, problem-solving stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4 pushing to remote repo&lt;br&gt;
And now whenever you feel like, code is complete, or maybe a part of it is complete, you confirm this, &lt;br&gt;
but before this you need to confirm your identity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git config user.name "yourGithubUsername"&lt;br&gt;
git config user.email "yourEmail"&lt;br&gt;
(Whatever is in quotes must be in quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you add the changes by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git add fileThatChanged&lt;br&gt;
(file name with extension without quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example - if I have a file named test.cpp and I want to add this file, then I would write&lt;br&gt;
git add test.cpp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you want to add all changed files, just write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git add .&lt;br&gt;
(that dot is important, meaning everything in this folder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you need to commit to the changes &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git commit -m "commit message"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-m for message, and commit message in quotes, this message should be short, compact but convey the changes you did&lt;br&gt;
Ok, now the changes are finalised, you need to push this to your remote repo, Just write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;git push&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask to confirm your identity, it will open your GitHub with an oAuth request, just give your GitHub credentials there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once authenticated, changes will be pushed to your remote origin (GitHub)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scam protection using a Raspberry Pi to perform caller ID and risk-assess incoming calls</title>
      <author>Dave Cranwell</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 11:06:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/davecranwell/scam-protection-using-a-raspberry-pi-to-perform-caller-id-and-risk-assess-incoming-calls-2nd0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/davecranwell/scam-protection-using-a-raspberry-pi-to-perform-caller-id-and-risk-assess-incoming-calls-2nd0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dad is getting on and isn't super tech-savvy. In fact some nice Indian gentlemen liberated a few hundred pounds from him in exchange for unlocking his own computer for him. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm doing all the reeducation I can, but as a mostly-offline person he has a lot to cover. For example, the idea that staff from a reputable megacorp would benevolently, and for no explained reason, phone you up out of the goodness of their hearts, because your computer - your computer amongst billions - had a virus...this is not at all suspicious to a huge percentage of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these events I've become obsessed with ways of helping Dad. I've spent months of my life watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNG0osIBAprVcZZ3ic84vw"&gt;Jim Browning's&lt;/a&gt; scam exposure videos. I wrote plain-english notes to be kept next to his phone on how to identify scam calls. Still he got sucked in on futher occasions and only managed to avoid serious loss because he &lt;em&gt;doesn't have an Amazon account&lt;/em&gt;. I've even resorted to blacklisting &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; his calls. This means the only calls allowed through must be manually white-listed. But you've guessed it, that whitelist must be managed online, using a badly architected React webapp, with no thought to information architecture or simplicity, that Dad doesn't want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of malicious calls he receives is clearly well beyond what British Telecom's pathetic Call Protect systems can keep up with. Scammers can change their numbers at will thanks to unscrupulous telecoms companies selling new ones, so BT and any other spam prevention system will always be playing catch-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#landline-users-are-lagging-behind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Landline users are lagging behind
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What BT can't do themselves, however, crowds can. Websites have cropped up like &lt;a href="//who-called.co.uk"&gt;who-called.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; in which anyone can search for a number to find what others have said about it. And, having tirelessly compared my dad's phone records against services like this, they are mostly very accurate. But of course, my dad isn't going to check these sites - his computer is turned off at the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caller blocking devices do exist, but these are post-hoc. If you receive a call you don't like only &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you block it. Most aren't even web-capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile phones often ship with caller identification packages, but landlines are still hugely popular in the older generations. &lt;strong&gt;What consumers are missing is a centralised, democratised, orchestrated effort, to cut off dangerous callers at a handset level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is essentially what I've attempted, as a little passion project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#badcaller"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/davecranwell/badcaller"&gt;Badcaller&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a Raspberry Pi, a tiny USB Modem, some code and a few tedious hours trying to understand the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set"&gt;Hayes AT Commands set&lt;/a&gt;, I've got a reasonable first draft of a box that can be placed beside the phone and can both identify and danger-check every phone call received. The big omission right this moment, is a screen. The "Badcaller" system is for now a browser-based display of your incomming calls and their danger. But this requires you to have a PC, or a phone - this isn't going to help Dad just yet. My next step would be to add a small screen, then perhaps a housing. Raspberry Pi's can be reasonably easily put into a "Kiosk mode" and when that's viable, I hope to test it with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interface is dead simple and hopefully completely unquestionable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEpWjLxKbnA"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#development-ongoing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Development (ongoing)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally stumbled across what looks like a silver bullet device for caller ID, the &lt;a href="https://www.artech.com.tw/en/product/detail/110"&gt;Artech AD102&lt;/a&gt;. This is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device"&gt;HID&lt;/a&gt; device though, not serial like a USB modem and requires DLLs to use. The &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-hid"&gt;node-hid&lt;/a&gt; package looked a plausible candidate here, but it became rapidly clear that the AD102 must be switched into a kind of "open for questions" mode to get responses out of it, mandating use of the DLLs. Those DLLs are only avaialble for Windows, have no source and can't seem to be recompiled into Linux Shared Objects (or if they can it was well beyond this web developer's capabilities). I considered &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/"&gt;Windows IoT&lt;/a&gt; too, which might have helped with the DLL, however Raspberry Pis use ARM processors and, from what I could gather, this would also require the DLL be recompiled. I eventually gave up with the AD102 entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovering that USB modems do Caller ID was a breakthrough. I even found comments on a modem on Amazon, from someone happily confirming that it worked really well for using AT commands to get the caller ID! I'm clearly not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modems are FSMs, so I required no cajoling to give &lt;a href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/"&gt;XState&lt;/a&gt; a try as I've had my eye on it for a while and I'm only slightly familiar with &lt;a href="http://machina-js.org/"&gt;Machina&lt;/a&gt;. Check out the amazing, interactive &lt;a href="https://xstate.js.org/viz/"&gt;visualisations&lt;/a&gt; you can do with XState.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/"&gt;Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; was also a very convenient discovery and is more suited to non-prod orchestration for which K8s would be overkill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, a doomed project in a way. The best outcome I could possibly achieve - making all scam calling untenable at a global level - would make this project/product useless. But it would be nice if someone else wanted to help and give it a shot. Let me know if you do! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about the project on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/davecranwell/badcaller"&gt;Github page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript News and Updates of April 2021</title>
      <author>Pavel Lazarev</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 10:59:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/plazarev/javascript-news-and-updates-of-april-2021-13p5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/plazarev/javascript-news-and-updates-of-april-2021-13p5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to my latest overview of fresh JavaScript news and updates. Today we will talk about novelties in JavaScript runtime environments, updates of popular DHTMLX libraries, a new JavaScript-based variation of the Rowhammer attack, and finish with a set of useful JavaScript tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-tools-and-updates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  New Tools and Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-new-in-nodejs-16"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What’s New in Node.js 16
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NkEd4eMp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yzk14w928sebjxk3h3s8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NkEd4eMp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yzk14w928sebjxk3h3s8.png" alt="Node.js logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript gained great popularity among developers thanks in large part to Node.js. This runtime environment enables you to compose JavaScript code on the server-side, making this programming language suitable for full-stack web development. And now Node.js is available in version 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This major release offers a range of novelties and enhancements to the existing feature set of Node.js. It is the first Node.js version that provides prebuilt binaries for Apple Silicon - processors for Apple products. It also comes with a new V8 JavaScript engine v9.0, ensuring better performance characteristics. Developers now can take advantage of other useful features such as Timers Promises API and RegExp Match indices. The release also includes some deprecations. To know more about this big update, read this &lt;a href="https://nodejs.medium.com/node-js-16-available-now-7f5099a97e70"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deno-continues-to-grow-and-gets-incorporated"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deno Continues to Grow and Gets Incorporated
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8z4C7iHH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j0k4d3vv5uwz3fhy5e1r.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8z4C7iHH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j0k4d3vv5uwz3fhy5e1r.jpg" alt="Deno logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deno is a relatively new technology that received a very warm welcome from the development community. This fully secure runtime environment has been known to the public only for a year, but the GitHub statistics says that thousands of developers already showed interest in this project and contributed to its improvement. There are also two recent bits of news related to Deno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development team led by Ryn Dahl provides regular Deno updates and the latest one (&lt;a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.9#faster-calls-into-rust-with-serde_v8"&gt;v1.9&lt;/a&gt;) has been rolled out this month. This version brings in numerous new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. The list of modifications includes native HTTP/2 web server, faster calls into Rust with serde_v8, import completions in the LSP, and many other useful things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second big news is that Deno is also establishing a company with the help of attracted seed investments. Becoming a legal entity means that further development and maintenance of Deno will be performed more effectively by the team of hired full-time engineers. At the same time, Deno officials pointed out that they have no intention to directly monetize the project and it will remain free for web developers. More information on the topic can be found in the &lt;a href="https://deno.com/blog/the-deno-company"&gt;Deno blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dhtmlx-diagram-updated-to-version-31"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DHTMLX Diagram Updated to Version 3.1
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--09KBobT9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1woiduyq8zbtro73oe6f.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--09KBobT9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1woiduyq8zbtro73oe6f.jpg" alt="DHTMLX Diagram v3.1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHTMLX Diagram is a useful JavaScript library that enables you to handle data visualization issues during the development process. Unlike many other diagramming components, this tool allows building various types of diagrams not only using a traditional coding approach but also with the Diagram editor. With the release of version 3.1, DHTMLX Diagram became even more powerful and developer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key feature of this update is a new diagram type – mind map. It provides a graphical way to present complex ideas and concepts with the help of predefined or custom shapes. You can even create 100% custom mind maps using straightforward HTML templates. There is also a new diagram editor designed specifically for more convenient work with mind maps. Newly added event handlers allow specifying how end-users will interact with custom shapes. DHTMLX Diagram now also supports TypeScript to help developers write quality code much faster. If you want to learn more details on this update, check out the &lt;a href="https://dhtmlx.com/blog/dhtmlx-diagram-3-1-with-mind-maps"&gt;release article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IzBWsgKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ds9pbio56hqd240yrv9k.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IzBWsgKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ds9pbio56hqd240yrv9k.jpg" alt="DHTMLX Gantt v7.1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHTMLX Gantt is one of the most popular choices among front-end developers when it comes to implementing Gantt chart functionality in software solutions. For instance, it is a core element of GanttPRO - a widely used software solution for project planning. The new version of this JavaScript library comes with a set of new features for more productive project management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with v7.1, DHTMLX Gantt allows allocating project tasks on a part-time basis, thereby utilizing them more efficiently for handling complex projects. All important project dates can be shown in summaries including rollup tasks and milestones.  Another new feature is the ability to set working schedules for specific time periods within one working calendar. If needed, you can also alter the height of any Gantt chart row for more convenient interaction with data by simple drag and drop. Find more information on these features and other improvements in the &lt;a href="https://dhtmlx.com/blog/dhtmlx-gantt-7-1-part-time-resource-assignment-rollup-tasks/"&gt;DHTMLX blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  New Rowhammer Attack Uses JavaScript Exploit to Affect DDR4 Memory
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7aFvMbV5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2pio9lalg7h8z2e0wbrq.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7aFvMbV5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2pio9lalg7h8z2e0wbrq.jpg" alt="Rowhammer attack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowhammer is a class of attacks that has been used by malicious users for committing cybercrimes since 2014. It does not rely on any software bugs or phishing methods but rather focuses on abusing the properties of the computer memory. In response, hardware developers started equipping modern memory modules with a special in-memory defense named Target Row Refresh (TRR). But this protective measure has proved ineffective with the appearance of a new threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of security specialists from Vrije University in Amsterdam and ETH Zurich has recently unveiled a new variation of the Rowhammer attack named &lt;a href="https://www.vusec.net/projects/smash"&gt;SMASH&lt;/a&gt;. This technique can be utilized to hack modern DDR4 RAM cards evading TRR. It is triggered with the help of a JavaScript exploit that helps to compromise the user’s browser. Experts assume that it will be a challenging task to deliver reliable protection against SMASH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter whether you are a newcomer to the JavaScript world or a highly skilled web programmer, you most likely make use of various online resources such as youtube channels, podcasts, forums, etc. dedicated to web development. I personally also enjoy using various social networks that suit well for exchanging views on different development trends or coding issues. Twitter, for instance, is used by many influencers to share various tips and tricks with a wide audience. If you want to learn something interesting about JavaScript on Twitter every day, here is the &lt;a href="https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/27-javascript-experts-follow-twitter"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of JavaScript experts to follow. &lt;/p&gt;

  How to Strengthen JavaScript Performance with GPU.js
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance is one of the main concerns for web developers when building data-intensive applications. There are many ways to improve JavaScript performance, but many of them imply complex code optimizations. But have you ever considered the possibility of relying on a GPU (graphical processing unit) for performing complex computations instead of a CPU, and thus facilitating the better performance of JavaScript apps? This idea lies at the core of GPU.js. It is a JS acceleration library intended for general-purpose programming on GPUs. More details on the benefits of using GPU.js in complex web apps are provided in this &lt;a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-gpu-to-improve-javascript-performance-e5a41c2e129b"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  Using Chrome DevTools for JavaScript Debugging
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debugging is a vital part of the development process, as it allows you to detect various syntax and logical errors in your code. The &lt;em&gt;console.log()&lt;/em&gt; method is probably the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to checking JavaScript code in the browser. But all major browsers also contain built-in tools that help you to test and debug your code more efficiently. I, like many of you, prefer to use the Google Chrome browser, but until recently I, unfortunately, did not devote due attention to the debugging capabilities of its built-in developer tools (also known as DevTools). If it’s the same with you, this &lt;a href="https://lo-victoria.com/debugging-javascript-efficiently-with-chrome-devtools"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; will help you to see the true value of DevTools for JavaScript debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine any modern web application without a data grid or more complex tree grid. These important UI elements serve for organizing big data in a tabular format and enable end-users to conveniently interact with it. Therefore, many programmers choose to use feature-packed JS libraries or UI widgets for implementing this functionality instead of building it from scratch. This &lt;a href="https://eugene.hashnode.dev/10-best-javascript-data-management-libraries"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; highlights the most popular JavaScript grid components and their main peculiarities.&lt;/p&gt;

  Handling Text in Modern JavaScript
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A string is a basic data type in JavaScript utilized for storing and manipulating textual data. Understanding strings and their core principles is a must for any JavaScript developer. It is great to be able to create and concatenate strings, but there are also many other useful techniques for working with them such as sorting strings, comparing strings, splitting a string, and more. This &lt;a href="https://www.baseclass.io/guides/string-handling-modern-js"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; will allow you to dig deeper into JavaScript strings and learn everything you should know about them with the help of multiple code samples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all that I wanted to share with you this month. Take care and stay tuned for more JavaScript news in May.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revolutionize your Coding Environment with these Tips</title>
      <author>𝐋𝐄𝑽𝐈𝑨𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐍 Programming</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 10:51:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/worldindev/revolutionize-your-coding-environment-with-these-tips-54h1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/worldindev/revolutionize-your-coding-environment-with-these-tips-54h1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is always helpful to get yourself a more comfortable coding environment.  Programming in my custom VSCode and on Codepen are very different things.  Here are some tips to make your coding environment better. So, let's start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey, do you want a free javascript cheat sheet? That's over 32k characters long, and with more than 250 resources (in addition of the cheat sheet). Grab that &lt;a href="https://worldindev.ck.page/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6cdd2915fd088df0735bc29e8d3d4e72aba5dc75e3bcca4ea97c89d6d15f6299/68747470733a2f2f6465762d746f2d75706c6f6164732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f75706c6f6164732f61727469636c65732f3461736839363233317a7a677031623236696a772e676966" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6cdd2915fd088df0735bc29e8d3d4e72aba5dc75e3bcca4ea97c89d6d15f6299/68747470733a2f2f6465762d746f2d75706c6f6164732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f75706c6f6164732f61727469636c65732f3461736839363233317a7a677031623236696a772e676966" alt="separation bar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-dark-mode"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Dark Mode
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Mode is much easier on your eyes than a light mode.  It is also better for you and will protect your eyes and decrease the chance of your eyesight diminishing.&lt;br&gt;
Some sites, however, do not have a dark mode.  You can fix this by installing one of the Browser Extenstions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark Reader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midnight Lizard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Midnight Lizard since you can customize it more.  Here's Codecademy with and without the extension activated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--61LHqYtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bpk7xsvnrud3r3kss3k2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--61LHqYtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bpk7xsvnrud3r3kss3k2.png" alt="Before using extension"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HKlT-ezQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4w06jemdwosw5i9ksexn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HKlT-ezQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4w06jemdwosw5i9ksexn.png" alt="After using extension"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-zooming-amp-website-scale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Zooming &amp;amp; Website Scale
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, text in a website, or just basically the initial scale is too big.  All I have to do is zoom out to 80% or something.  Especially on sites like Codepen or JSFiddle, it's better to feel like you are coding on a bigger screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ewl6dbkY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/54jypo43pshx8107bqf9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ewl6dbkY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/54jypo43pshx8107bqf9.png" alt="Website Zoom"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-always-enable-live-autocomplete-amp-emmet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Always enable Live Autocomplete &amp;amp; Emmet
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is always good to enable the live autocompletion and emmet extensions while coding.  This makes it easier to code and you can do more in less time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autocompletion Enabled&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZoUeowYD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6bj4ngxc5mwhwqwsgng8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZoUeowYD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6bj4ngxc5mwhwqwsgng8.png" alt="Autocompletion in use"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmet Enabled&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xfKRsSXd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/asaysnz884w4f9w0a79s.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xfKRsSXd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/asaysnz884w4f9w0a79s.gif" alt="Emmet in use"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-code-with-a-community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Code with a community
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether in a discord group or coding alongside your fellow buddies at DEV, it's always good to ask for tips and share what you are making (unless it's a secret).  I find that coding with a community is more motivating and better than doing everything without feedback and bug fixes on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for a community?  Join ours, World In Dev!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://worldindev.ck.page"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/pkqqUj44t8"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-listen-to-something"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Listen to something
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether listening to music, the noises around the house, news, or something else, keep your ears busy with something else other than your fingers tapping the keyboard.&lt;br&gt;
Stick in some earphones and listen to something else.  This way, you can stay focused a bit longer and also, you'll improve in Multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tBVRfloF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611134612965-d0ba82a139b2%3Fixid%3DMnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MXx8c291bmQlMjB3YXZlc3xlbnwwfHwwfHw%253D%26ixlib%3Drb-1.2.1%26auto%3Dformat%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D800%26q%3D60" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tBVRfloF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611134612965-d0ba82a139b2%3Fixid%3DMnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MXx8c291bmQlMjB3YXZlc3xlbnwwfHwwfHw%253D%26ixlib%3Drb-1.2.1%26auto%3Dformat%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D800%26q%3D60" alt="computer analyzing sound waves"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-make-a-todo-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Make a Todo List
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't always remember everything, so why not be more organized and make a Todo List for each project you make?&lt;br&gt;
Whether storing Memos in your phone, writing them down in a Markdown file or keeping them on a piece of paper, you'll have something to restore lost memories when coding.&lt;br&gt;
Organization plays a very large part in coding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-organize-your-workspace"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Organize your workspace
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't have papers flying all over your desk along with coffee stains and a torn-up chair.  Clean out and organize your workspace to be much better than before.  Honestly, you'd prefer to have a clean space/house than a messy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9gSkz9y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584809396472-d38952a285e2%3Fixid%3DMnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTV8fGNvbXB1dGVyJTIwd29ya3xlbnwwfHwwfHw%253D%26ixlib%3Drb-1.2.1%26auto%3Dformat%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D800%26q%3D60" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R9gSkz9y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584809396472-d38952a285e2%3Fixid%3DMnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTV8fGNvbXB1dGVyJTIwd29ya3xlbnwwfHwwfHw%253D%26ixlib%3Drb-1.2.1%26auto%3Dformat%26fit%3Dcrop%26w%3D800%26q%3D60" alt="Clean Computer Workspace"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(mine's not nearly as clean as that)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-memorable-amp-descriptive-names"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Memorable &amp;amp; Descriptive Names
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the reason a post gets trending or a news issue gets read is mainly because of the title.  When you write or code, make everything easier for yourself by naming your files something descriptive.  Also, what's helpful is to make huge comment blocks in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Names like &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;about.html&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;contact.html&lt;/code&gt; would be better than just naming your html files randomly like &lt;code&gt;a.html&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b.html&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;c.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To place comment blocks in your code, just make a big banner  for separation like below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/******************************/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**********Code Block**********/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/******************************/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure the code blocks are easily visible to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6cdd2915fd088df0735bc29e8d3d4e72aba5dc75e3bcca4ea97c89d6d15f6299/68747470733a2f2f6465762d746f2d75706c6f6164732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f75706c6f6164732f61727469636c65732f3461736839363233317a7a677031623236696a772e676966" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6cdd2915fd088df0735bc29e8d3d4e72aba5dc75e3bcca4ea97c89d6d15f6299/68747470733a2f2f6465762d746f2d75706c6f6164732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f75706c6f6164732f61727469636c65732f3461736839363233317a7a677031623236696a772e676966" alt="seperation bar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
