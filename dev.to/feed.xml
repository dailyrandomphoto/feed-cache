      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently on the Dev Interrupted Podcast, &lt;a href="https://www.outsystems.com/"&gt;OutSystems&lt;/a&gt; CEO and founder Paulo Rosado joined us to chat about his path to founding the company, advice for successful leaders, and the growing threat of technical debt for businesses around the world. The conversation below has been edited and summarized for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tell-us-about-outsystems-founding-story-what-inspired-you-to-start-the-company"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tell us about OutSystems' founding story. What inspired you to start the company?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2021, OutSystems was valued at $9.5 billion dollars - but it certainly didn’t start out that way. The idea behind OutSystems was decades in the making, and its mission stems from what I observed after moving to Silicon Valley back in the mid-nineties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey in technology began when I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal and moved to the US to get my Masters in Computer Science from Stanford. Afterward, while working in Silicon Valley, I began to understand just how much of a problem technical debt was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on a very large engineering team, we were faced with tackling a gigantic project in Java and I realized the issues of releasing and maintaining code sustainably. The lack of productivity in the software development process was appalling. Fixing this problem is ultimately what motivated me to found OutSystems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before founding OutSystems, there was a small company I founded and later sold, which focused on internet and intranet projects. It wasn’t a bad company, but we kept failing. Projects were never delivered on time or on budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would think to ourselves, “We’re smart. How is this possible?” Our inclination was to blame the requirements of the project, labeling the scope as incorrect and adjust from there. However, we began to realize that the companies hiring us for these projects wanted us to make changes as we were developing in response to rapidly changing environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue we began to face was the continual accumulation of technical debt. We would reach first production and realize we had built something users didn’t want, requiring us to go back and rework the stuff we had just built. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We came up with this realization that the problem was not that the requirements up front were wrong. The problem was that the cost of changing wrong requirements, which are a fact of life, is very high.” - &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/outsystems-the-journey-to-a-9-5b-valuation/"&gt;on the Dev Interrupted podcast at 6:03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="232px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/1Upd99Drq75d6WQK62e73X"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon was occurring in 90% of projects at the time. Things were always over budget and always late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s easy to take this for granted because concepts like Agile, DevOps, CI/CD are mainstream. But at the time, you had to build software the same way you build a bridge.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-technical-debt-a-challenge-for-companies-now-how-has-this-problem-changed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is technical debt a challenge for companies now? How has this problem changed?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical debt has become a large problem for businesses, and one that only compounds with time. Tech debt doesn’t have a singular cause - it’s the accumulation of several factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my career, I’ve seen first-hand the complexity brought about by the evolution of software development. For instance, we’ve seen an explosion of languages, paradigms and frameworks that can all be used to achieve a solution. Often these languages are dispersed with no connections between them, so tracking these dependencies requires a great deal of sophistication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, turnover within the development team is a critical problem that leads to technical debt. The moment a company loses a developer, the knowledge accrued by that developer also departs the company. The hole left behind is complex, including code,  frameworks and intent behind how their systems are structured. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been my experience that a lost team member can take as much as 20% to 30% of the fundamental knowledge of a system with them. Reverse engineering their work is both time-intensive and inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies have tried to corral this problem by investing in coding standards. While these constraints can help mitigate the loss of a valued developer, our research indicates turnover remains a significant problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7Pcsmt-KBQ"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#outsystems-recently-released-a-study-on-the-effects-of-technical-debt-what-were-its-findings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OutSystems recently released a study on the effects of technical debt. What were its findings?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, OutSystems &lt;a href="https://www.outsystems.com/stop-tech-debt/"&gt;surveyed 500 large companies around the world&lt;/a&gt; to examine the cost of technical debt facing businesses and uncover the challenges companies face as they confront its causes. The results from the companies surveyed were many of the same things I’ve observed throughout my career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that while the causes of technical debt have largely remained the same, the pace at which technical debt occurs has grown substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so it's a hack, right? What we call a hack at OutSystems, they did a hack to just release the software quickly. And those hacks compound into technical debt.” - &lt;a href="https://devinterrupted.com/podcast/outsystems-the-journey-to-a-9-5b-valuation/"&gt;on the Dev Interrupted podcast at 27:11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey we conducted isolated three major causes of technical debt. They are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The amount of developer frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; An increase in frameworks leads to an increase in technical debt. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Developer erosion.&lt;/strong&gt; Employees leaving an organization and taking legacy knowledge with them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Compromises in quality of architecture and code.&lt;/strong&gt; Often caused by a shortsighted view that what needs to be done now is more important than long-term stability of the codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, companies believed they could buy their way out of this problem, but that strategy has proven ineffective. The reality is, the most successful companies must build the software they require to meet their business needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply purchasing what you need doesn’t solve your problems because even purchased systems must be cobbled together, requiring unique API’s, unique UI’s, unique portals, and unique mobile applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2hZnWvqTPk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#does-outsystems-play-a-role-in-helping-companies-cut-tech-debt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Does OutSystems play a role in helping companies cut tech debt?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of what we do at OutSystems is focused on tackling those three fundamental problems. We understand that technical debt amasses slowly over time, through a myriad of decisions that appear much smaller at their onset than their totality would suggest. Once these “tiny” decisions become a major problem, they inhibit investment in current operations and future innovations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing pressures of today’s fast-paced business environment often push companies toward decisions that spiral into technical debt. The good news is that by creating a development process that marries short-term deadlines with long-term strategic goals, it’s possible to “pay down” that debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that any company is capable of whittling away technical debt with the correct tools and processes, and I founded OutSystems because companies shouldn’t have to choose between building fast and building right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about technical debt, how to combat it, and what to expect in the future, you can download the &lt;a href="https://www.outsystems.com/stop-tech-debt/"&gt;2021 Technical Debt Report&lt;/a&gt; on our website.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flame 1.0 is here!</title>
      <author>Luan Nico</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:56:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/blue-fire/flame-10-is-here-430n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/blue-fire/flame-10-is-here-430n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there, folks! It's been a while since our last article, but if you are following &lt;a href="https://github.com/flame-engine/flame"&gt;Flame on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or participating in our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, you know very well that we have not been idle. Far from it. In fact, you might have noticed more and more Release Candidates being put out regularly, mostly with some needed updates and cleanups, a few new core features, bug fixes, and incorporating valuable feedback from our amazing Game Jam. That is because both the team and the community have been working together, relentlessly, to make Flame the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, first of all, I would like to make it very clear that we are not done with this goal, not even close -- the pile of things we know could be improved, extended or added is only shadowed by the mountain that we don't even know about yet. So the first thing I would like to reassure everyone, with this article, is that nothing really changes in that regard. We will still be putting out PRs, receiving invaluable help from the community, making improvements, new features, bug fixes. We will still be at discord, helping out new people, having deep, productive discussions with veterans, and collaborating together to keep growing and enhancing all Blue Fire's projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we do have a key milestone to share. You might have already heard about it on the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/flutter/announcing-flutter-2-8-31d2cb7e19f5"&gt;Flutter 2.8 release article&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe got a sneak peek on pub; but, regardless, we wanted to double down and proudly announce we just released Flame 1.0.0. Yes, it's official, and finally here! What an end-of-year holiday gift to us to finally be able to say that, given all the work that has been put into it! We are very happy with the current state of our code and the capabilities provided, and we think it's time to make this commitment. Thank you so much for every single one of you, that contributed with PRs, discussions, questions (that led us to improve some docs or reconceptualize some API), monetary donations via our &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/bluefireoss"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, or that used Flame, made something great, participated in any way, gave us a star on &lt;a href="https://github.com/flame-engine/flame"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or just for reading and sharing this article. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let me reiterate; we are still going to keep improving, updating, fixing, enhancing Flame. In fact, I hope version 1.0.0 lives very briefly on pub, to be replaced with 1.0.1, 1.1.0, whichever comes first, very soon. This just means we believe the current API is stable, and we won't be making big, breaking changes that often, or without warning. Expect more structured, stable updates, especially new features. It also means we can focus our attention now to improving our docs, bridge packages, tooling, examples and tutorials to make sure this awesome ecosystem that came about works seamlessly and frictionlessly, and that people can easily welcome people to join and learn. We are also happy to have established and to carry on this partnership with the Flutter team to make sure we all pave a future together for Flame and our beloved community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on that note, we ask you to update your dependency, head over to &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; to continue the discussion, and if you haven't, please check &lt;a href="https://medium.com/flutter/announcing-flutter-2-8-31d2cb7e19f5"&gt;Flutter's article&lt;/a&gt; about all the amazing things packed on Flutter 2.8, and let us know if you have any feedback! Thanks everyone again for everything, and have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beginning Git and Github </title>
      <author>ADEOYE ADEFEMI OPEOLUWA</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:47:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/opeolluwa/beginning-git-and-github-4l3k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/opeolluwa/beginning-git-and-github-4l3k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we took a quick tour on the subject of git and GitHub. Herein we'll get to the real deal of installing git on our machine 💻. You might wanna power your computer it's show time 😉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-git-for-windows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing git for Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"&gt;https://git-scm.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the download link for Windows and allow the download to complete &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2IbVqwl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i6w1nf18m3mrhnqspi8j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2IbVqwl6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i6w1nf18m3mrhnqspi8j.png" alt="download git" width="800" height="487"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse to the download location (or use the download shortcut in your browser). Double-click the file to extract and launch the installer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VUIQo0Cs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bhvz2yw3fjhob4vujtsx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VUIQo0Cs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bhvz2yw3fjhob4vujtsx.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="231"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceed to install the downloaded package &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2Qm93g1w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsuqlsqth0zqcqgn9z2y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2Qm93g1w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsuqlsqth0zqcqgn9z2y.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="396"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read and accept end user agreement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zIaHFJUO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r0im44itreqgjeybxzc2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zIaHFJUO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r0im44itreqgjeybxzc2.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this the installer Will ask series of questions starting with, &lt;strong&gt;installation location.&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to stick to the default (unless you're feeling adventurous), click next or press &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt; on your keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally you should have &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all go well, cheers to us! We have just installed git on your machine 🍻&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1 line of code: How to camelCase a string</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/martinkr/1-line-of-code-how-to-camelcase-a-string-558g</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toCamelCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;_-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Returns a new string in camel case. &lt;br&gt;
Uses &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;underscore&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dash&lt;/code&gt; as delimiter.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-repository-amp-npm-package"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The repository &amp;amp; npm package
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Project 8:HTML 5 Canvas</title>
      <author>prachigarg19</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:35:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-8html-5-canvas-7bg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-8html-5-canvas-7bg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my "Build 30 Js Projects in 30 Days" Series .This is day 8 and project 8. If you haven't read the other articles in this series please check them out first. I'll list them at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my previous article. This is the Day 8 challenge of &lt;a href="https://javascript30.com/"&gt;Wes Bos Javascript30 course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final result:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/prachigarg19/embed/PoJNOZw?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press rerun to clear canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;ADDED FUNCTIONALITIES:&lt;/u&gt; I have made this project compatible for mouse operated and touch screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/prachigarg19/Javacript_beginner_projects/tree/main/js30"&gt;My source code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always before starting download the starter files from &lt;a href="https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I've made a separate article on how to download starter files, you can check it out &lt;a href="https://dev.to/prachigarg19/build-30-javascript-projects-in-30-daysday-0-2m8j"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#part-1html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PART 1:HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I've simply used canvas element to create a canvas. The important part is the style added to container. &lt;br&gt;
I'll explain this part in javascript part for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#part-3javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  PART 3:JAVASCRIPT
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will make our project interactive.&lt;br&gt;
Initially I've took draw id from dom and have given it a height and width equal to that of window's height and width respectively.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let canvas=document.getElementById('draw');
//setup size of camvas to cover the whole screen
canvas.height=window.innerHeight;
canvas.width=window.innerWidth;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now i will use &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext"&gt;getContext&lt;/a&gt; to get the type of content that is returned from canvas. Since we want to create 2d drawings,we'll set it at 2d.&lt;br&gt;
Now I've simply set the properties-&lt;br&gt;
1.&lt;u&gt;setStroke&lt;/u&gt;- It is used to set the color of the stroke that'll be drawn.&lt;br&gt;
2.&lt;u&gt;lineCap&lt;/u&gt;- It sets the shape with which our stroke will start with in the beginning.&lt;br&gt;
3.&lt;u&gt;lineJoin&lt;/u&gt;- It sets the shape at joining point of two lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctx.strokeStyle=`black`;
ctx.lineJoin='circle';
ctx.lineCap='circle';
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we will create a flag that will decide whether or not we have to draw strokes or not. We don't want to show unnecessary strokes when user stops touching screen/clicking or user touches anywhere away from canvas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let flag=false;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially it is set false as it will set true only if user touches screen/clicks on canvas element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will add event listeners on canvas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I have used pointer events and not mouse events as shown in course's video to make it compatible for both touch devices/mouse operated devices. &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events"&gt;Read more about this event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.First action that user will do is simply click/touch on the screen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;canvas.addEventListener('pointdown',(e)=&amp;gt;{flag=true; 
    [startX,startY]=[e.offsetX,e.offsetY];

    })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;startX and startY are the coordinates of the points where user clicks and hence the point user want to begin drawing from. offsets give the coordinates where pointdown was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.User will move around the canvas. This is where the strokes have to be shown and thus we will call draw function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;canvas.addEventListener('pointmove',draw);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3.User will stop touching/clicking canvas or user will click/touch away from canvas. In both these cases we'll set out flag to false as we do not want draw function to be called (No strokes should be drawn)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//if user stops pressing mouse
canvas.addEventListener('pointup',()=&amp;gt;flag=false);
//if user clicks anywhere other than canvas
canvas.addEventListener('pointout',()=&amp;gt;flag=false);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we will create draw function-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function draw(e){
    if(flag==false) return;//user is not drawing
    //  setting varying color 
    ctx.strokeStyle=`hsl(${hue},100%,50%)`;
    //start path of stroke
    ctx.beginPath();
    //move to the starting point where user clicked
    ctx.moveTo(startX,startY);
    //draw line till this point 
    ctx.lineTo(e.offsetX,e.offsetY);
    //offset property returns the coordinate at which mouse if clicked. so it will join the line to the point where user keeps moving the mouse.
    ctx.stroke();
    //actually drawing the line between the points

    //setting start points to the last point at which user stopped drawing,without this if draw is triggered then starting point will stick to mousedown offsets only and we want it to start from the point where mouse is being moved currently.
    [startX,startY]=[e.offsetX,e.offsetY];
 //we want color to start from the hue=0 value when it reaches 360.
    hue=(hue&amp;gt;360?0:hue+1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's take the inline css part we talked about in the html part. The pointermove event is fired when a pointer changes coordinates, and the pointer has not been canceled by a browser touch-action. Without touch-action:none browser will cancel our pointermove and so we won't be able to continue our stroke. Setting it to none prevents this problem. &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48124372/pointermove-event-not-working-with-touch-why-not"&gt;For more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-i-learnt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things I learnt:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally everything written. 🥴&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#previous-article-from-this-series"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Previous article from this series:&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/prachigarg19/project-7-array-cardio-day-2-25ln"&gt;Day 7 project 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for today's project.Next project will be project 9 where we will discuss about 14 Dev Tool tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any doubts or suggestions please do let me know in the comment section. I'll be more than happy to interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#pyroscope-rideshare-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pyroscope Rideshare Example
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGkIzR-r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135728737-0c5e54ca-1e78-4c6d-933c-145f441c96a9.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGkIzR-r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135728737-0c5e54ca-1e78-4c6d-933c-145f441c96a9.gif" alt="python_example_architecture_05_00" width="880" height="579"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: For documentation on the Pyroscope pip package visit &lt;a href="https://pyroscope.io/docs/python/"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example we show a simplified, basic use case of Pyroscope. We simulate a "ride share" company which has three endpoints found in &lt;code&gt;server.py&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/bike&lt;/code&gt;    : calls the &lt;code&gt;order_bike(search_radius)&lt;/code&gt; function to order a bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/car&lt;/code&gt;     : calls the &lt;code&gt;order_car(search_radius)&lt;/code&gt; function to order a car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/scooter&lt;/code&gt; : calls the &lt;code&gt;order_scooter(search_radius)&lt;/code&gt; function to order a scooter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also simulate running 3 distinct servers in 3 different regions (via &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/examples/python/docker-compose.yml"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;us-east-1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;us-west-1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eu-west-1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful capabilities of Pyroscope is the ability to tag your data in a way that is meaningful to you. In this case, we have two natural divisions, and so we "tag" our data to represent those:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt;: statically tags the region of the server running the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;vehicle&lt;/code&gt;: dynamically tags the endpoint (similar to how one might tag a controller rails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tagging-static-region"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tagging static region
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tagging something static, like the &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt;, can be done in the initialization code in the &lt;code&gt;config.tags&lt;/code&gt; variable:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyroscope.configure(
    app_name       = "ride-sharing-app",
    server_address = "http://pyroscope:4040",
    tags           = {
        "region":   f'{os.getenv("REGION")}', # Tags the region based off the environment variable
    }
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tagging-dynamically-within-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tagging dynamically within functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tagging something more dynamically, like we do for the &lt;code&gt;vehicle&lt;/code&gt; tag can be done inside our utility &lt;code&gt;find_nearest_vehicle()&lt;/code&gt; function using a &lt;code&gt;with pyroscope.tag_wrapper()&lt;/code&gt; block&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def find_nearest_vehicle(n, vehicle):
    with pyroscope.tag_wrapper({ "vehicle": vehicle}):
        i = 0
        start_time = time.time()
        while time.time() - start_time &amp;lt; n:
            i += 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this block does, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the tag &lt;code&gt;{ "vehicle" =&amp;gt; "car" }&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;execute the &lt;code&gt;find_nearest_vehicle()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the block ends it will (behind the scenes) remove the &lt;code&gt;{ "vehicle" =&amp;gt; "car" }&lt;/code&gt; from the application since that block is complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resulting-flamegraph-performance-results-from-the-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resulting flamegraph / performance results from the example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-the-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running the example
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run the example run the following commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Pull latest pyroscope image:
docker pull pyroscope/pyroscope:latest

# Run the example project:
docker-compose up --build

# Reset the database (if needed):
# docker-compose down
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this example will do is run all the code mentioned above and also send some mock-load to the 3 servers as well as their respective 3 endpoints. If you select our application: &lt;code&gt;ride-sharing-app.cpu&lt;/code&gt; from the dropdown, you should see a flamegraph that looks like this (below). After we give 20-30 seconds for the flamegraph to update and then click the refresh button we see our 3 functions at the bottom of the flamegraph taking CPU resources &lt;em&gt;proportional to the size&lt;/em&gt; of their respective &lt;code&gt;search_radius&lt;/code&gt; parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wheres-the-performance-bottleneck"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where's the performance bottleneck?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--L2cHuckb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135881284-c75a5b65-6151-44fb-a459-c1f9559cb51a.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--L2cHuckb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135881284-c75a5b65-6151-44fb-a459-c1f9559cb51a.jpg" alt="python_first_slide_05" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step when analyzing a profile outputted from your application, is to take note of the &lt;em&gt;largest node&lt;/em&gt; which is where your application is spending the most resources. In this case, it happens to be the &lt;code&gt;order_car&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using the Pyroscope package, is that now that we can investigate further as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;order_car()&lt;/code&gt; function is problematic. Tagging both &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vehicle&lt;/code&gt; allows us to test two good hypotheses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something is wrong with the &lt;code&gt;/car&lt;/code&gt; endpoint code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something is wrong with one of our regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze this we can select one or more tags from the "Select Tag" dropdown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ukKu_I8k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135525308-b81e87b0-6ffb-4ef0-a6bf-3338483d0fc4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ukKu_I8k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135525308-b81e87b0-6ffb-4ef0-a6bf-3338483d0fc4.png" alt="image" width="429" height="234"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#narrowing-in-on-the-issue-using-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Narrowing in on the Issue Using Tags
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing there is an issue with the &lt;code&gt;order_car()&lt;/code&gt; function we automatically select that tag. Then, after inspecting multiple &lt;code&gt;region&lt;/code&gt; tags, it becomes clear by looking at the timeline that there is an issue with the &lt;code&gt;us-west-1&lt;/code&gt; region, where it alternates between high-cpu times and low-cpu times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also see that the &lt;code&gt;mutex_lock()&lt;/code&gt; function is consuming almost 70% of CPU resources during this time period. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KlF71V5O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135805908-ae9a1650-51fc-457a-8c47-0b56e8538b08.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KlF71V5O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135805908-ae9a1650-51fc-457a-8c47-0b56e8538b08.jpg" alt="python_second_slide_05" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-two-time-periods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing two time periods
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Pyroscope's "comparison view" we can actually select two different time ranges from the timeline to compare the resulting flamegraphs. The pink section on the left timeline results in the left flamegraph, and the blue section on the right represents the right flamegraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we select a period of low-cpu utilization and a period of high-cpu utilization we can see that there is clearly different behavior in the &lt;code&gt;mutex_lock()&lt;/code&gt; function where it takes &lt;strong&gt;51% of CPU&lt;/strong&gt; during low-cpu times and &lt;strong&gt;78% of CPU&lt;/strong&gt; during high-cpu times.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H77tw57C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135805969-55fdee40-fe0c-412d-9ec0-0bbc6a748ed4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H77tw57C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135805969-55fdee40-fe0c-412d-9ec0-0bbc6a748ed4.jpg" alt="python_third_slide_05" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visualizing-diff-between-two-flamegraphs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Visualizing Diff Between Two Flamegraphs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the difference &lt;em&gt;in this case&lt;/em&gt; is stark enough to see in the comparison view, sometimes the diff between the two flamegraphs is better visualized with them overlayed over each other. Without changing any parameters, we can simply select the diff view tab and see the difference represented in a color-coded diff flamegraph.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2_mnFM0O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135805986-594ffa3b-e735-4f91-875d-4f76fdff2b60.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2_mnFM0O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323466/135805986-594ffa3b-e735-4f91-875d-4f76fdff2b60.jpg" alt="python_fourth_slide_05" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-use-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More use cases
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been beta testing this feature with several different companies and some of the ways that we've seen companies tag their performance data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging jobs from a redis / sidekiq / rabbitmq queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging commits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging staging / production environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging different parts of their testing suites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-roadmap"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future Roadmap
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love for you to try out this example and see what ways you can adapt this to your python application. Continuous profiling has become an increasingly popular tool for the monitoring and debugging of performance issues (arguably the fourth pillar of observability). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'd love to continue to improve this pip package by adding things like integrations with popular tools, memory profiling, etc. and we would love to hear what features &lt;em&gt;you would like to see&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced typescript for React developers</title>
      <author>Nadia Makarevich</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/adevnadia/advanced-typescript-for-react-developers-8kc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adevnadia/advanced-typescript-for-react-developers-8kc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second article in the series “typescript for React developers”. In the first one, we figured out what Typescript generics are and how to use them to write re-usable react components: &lt;a href="/posts/typescript-generics-for-react-developers"&gt;Typescript Generics for React developers&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s time to dive into other advanced typescript concepts and understand how and why we need things like &lt;strong&gt;type guards&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;keyof&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;typeof&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;as const&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;indexed types&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we found out from the article above, Judi is an ambitious developer and wants to implement her own online shop, a competitor to Amazon: she’s going to sell everything there! We left her when she implemented a re-usable select component with typescript generics. The component is pretty basic: it allows to pass an array of &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;, assumes that those values have &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; for rendering select options, and have an &lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; handler to listen to the selected values.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
};

type GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt; = {
  values: TValue[];
  onChange: (value: TValue) =&amp;gt; void;
};

export const GenericSelect = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;({ values, onChange }: GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; {
  const onSelectChange = (e) =&amp;gt; {
    const val = values.find((value) =&amp;gt; value.id === e.target.value);

    if (val) onChange(val);
  };

  return (
    &amp;lt;select onChange={onSelectChange}&amp;gt;
      {values.map((value) =&amp;gt; (
        &amp;lt;option key={value.id} value={value.id}&amp;gt;
          {value.title}
        &amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;
      ))}
    &amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and then this component can be used with any data types Judi has in her application&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Book&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; console.log(value.author)} values={books} /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; console.log(value.releaseDate)} values={movies} /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although, as the shop grew, she quickly found out that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; data type is an exaggeration: we are still limited since we assume that our data will always have &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; there. But now Judi wants to sell laptops, and laptops have &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; in their data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Laptop = {
  id: string;
  model: string;
  releaseDate: string;
}

// This will fail, since there is no "title" in the Laptop type
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Laptop&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; console.log(value.model)} values={laptops} /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, Judi wants to avoid data normalization just for select purposes and make the select component more generic instead. What can she do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rendering-not-only-titles-in-options"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rendering not only titles in options
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judi decides, that just passing the desired attribute as a prop to the select component would be enough to fulfil her needs for the time being. Basically, she’d have something like this in its API:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Laptop&amp;gt; titleKey="model" {...} /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and the select component would then render Laptop models instead of titles in the options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MxHus3b2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shcks3572ynz1btnrrsv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MxHus3b2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/shcks3572ynz1btnrrsv.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="452"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would work, but there is one problem with this: not type-safe 🙂. Ideally, we would want typescript to fail if this attribute doesn’t exist in the data model that is used in the select component. This is where typescript’s &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keyof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; operator comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;keyof&lt;/code&gt; basically generates a type from an object’s keys. If I use &lt;code&gt;keyof&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;Laptop&lt;/code&gt; type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Laptop = {
  id: string;
  model: string;
  releaseDate: string;
}

type LaptopKeys = keyof Laptop;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in &lt;code&gt;LaptopKeys&lt;/code&gt; I’ll find a union of its keys: &lt;code&gt;"id" | "model" | "releaseDate"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, most amazingly, typescript is smart enough to generate those types for generics as well! This will work perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7ZxrJi2a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj71kq325grvhgbgjdc5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7ZxrJi2a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oj71kq325grvhgbgjdc5.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="132"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I can use it with all selects and typescript will catch any typos or copy-paste errors:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Laptop&amp;gt; titleKey="model" {...} /&amp;gt;
// inside GenericSelect "titleKey" will be typed to "id" | "model" | "releaseDate"

&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Book&amp;gt; titleKey="author" {...} /&amp;gt;
// inside GenericSelect "titleKey" will be typed to "id" | "title" | "author"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and we can make the type &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; a little bit more inclusive and make the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; optional&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = {
  id: string;
  title?: string;
}

export const GenericSelect = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(props: GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; {
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/vigorous-neumann-0w1ti?file=/src/select.tsx"&gt;See full working example in codesandbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important&lt;/em&gt;: Although this example works perfectly, I would not recommend using it in actual apps. It lacks a bit of elegance and is not generic enough &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. Read until the end of the article for a better example of a select component with customizable labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-list-of-categories-refactor-select"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The list of categories - refactor select
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that we have lists of goods covered with our generic select, it’s time to solve other problems on Judi’s website. One of them is that she has her catalog page clattered with all the selects and additional information that she shows when a value is selected. What she needs, she decides, is to split it into categories, and only show one category at a time. She again wants to use the generic select for it (well, who’s not lazy in this industry, right?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bJ0qQ8M---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/soql4jmh06f7u5la5ng5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bJ0qQ8M---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/soql4jmh06f7u5la5ng5.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="561"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The categories is just a simple array of strings: &lt;code&gt;const categories = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, our current generic select unfortunately doesn’t work with string values. Let’s fix it! And interestingly enough, this seems-to-be-simple implementation will allow us to get familiar with five new advanced typescript technics: operators &lt;strong&gt;as const&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;typeof&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;type guards&lt;/strong&gt; idea and &lt;strong&gt;indexed types&lt;/strong&gt;. But let’s start with the existing code and take a closer look at where exactly we depend on the &lt;code&gt;TValue&lt;/code&gt; type to be an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ehPC6fqf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bqd5iltwqucvm9w1xz38.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ehPC6fqf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bqd5iltwqucvm9w1xz38.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="493"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After careful examination of this picture, we can extract three major changes that we need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; type into something that understands strings as well as objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rid of reliance on &lt;code&gt;value.id&lt;/code&gt; as the unique identificator of the value in the list of options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert &lt;code&gt;value[titleKey]&lt;/code&gt; into something that understands strings as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this step-by-step approach to refactoring, the next moves are more or less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;. Convert &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt; into a union type (i.e. just a fancy “or” operator for types) and get rid of &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; there completely:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = { id: string } | string;

// Now "TValue" can be either a string, or an object that has an "id" in it
export const GenericSelect = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(props: GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; {
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;. Get rid of direct access of &lt;code&gt;value.id&lt;/code&gt; . We can do that by converting all those calls to a function &lt;code&gt;getStringFromValue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bTlPJOv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cl731n6xst2f7sqrgl1t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bTlPJOv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cl731n6xst2f7sqrgl1t.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="449"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where the very basic implementation from the before-typescript era would look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const getStringFromValue = (value) =&amp;gt; value.id || value;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not going to fly with typescript though: remember, our &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is Generic and can be a string as well as an object, so we need to help typescript here to understand what exactly it is before accessing anything specific.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = { id: string } | string;

const getStringFromValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    // here "value" will be the type of "string"
    return value;
  }

  // here "value" will be the type of "NOT string", in our case { id: string }
  return value.id;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The code in the function is known as &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;type guard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in typescript: an expression that narrows down type within some scope. See what is happening? First, we check whether the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is a string by using the standard javascript &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; operator. Now, within the “truthy” branch of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression, typescript will know for sure that value is a string, and we can do anything that we’d usually do with a string there. Outside of it, typescript will know for sure, that the value is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a string, and in our case, it means it’s an object with an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; in it. Which allows us to return &lt;code&gt;value.id&lt;/code&gt; safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;. Refactor the &lt;code&gt;value[titleKey]&lt;/code&gt; access. Considering that a lot of our data types would want to customise their labels, and more likely than not in the future we’d want to convert it to be even more custom, with icons or special formatting, the easiest option here is just to move the responsibility of extracting required information to the consumer. This can be done by passing a function to select that converts value on the consumer side to a string (or ReactNode in the future). No typescript mysteries here, just normal React:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt; = {
  formatLabel: (value: TValue) =&amp;gt; string;
  ...
};

export const GenericSelect = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(props: GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; {
  ...
  return (
    &amp;lt;select onChange={onSelectChange}&amp;gt;
      {values.map((value) =&amp;gt; (
        &amp;lt;option key={getStringFromValue(value)} value={getStringFromValue(value)}&amp;gt;
          {formatLabel(value)}
        &amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;
      ))}
    &amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;
  );
}

// Show movie title and release date in select label
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt; ... formatLabel={(value) =&amp;gt; `${value.title} (${value.releaseDate})`} /&amp;gt;

// Show laptop model and release date in select label
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Laptop&amp;gt; ... formatLabel={(value) =&amp;gt; `${value.model, released in ${value.releaseDate}`} /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now we have it! A perfect generic select, that supports all data formats that we need and allows us to fully customise labels as a nice bonus. The full code looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = { id: string } | string;

type GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt; = {
  formatLabel: (value: TValue) =&amp;gt; string;
  onChange: (value: TValue) =&amp;gt; void;
  values: TValue[];
};

const getStringFromValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; {
  if (typeof value === 'string') return value;

  return value.id;
};

export const GenericSelect = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(props: GenericSelectProps&amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt;) =&amp;gt; {
  const { values, onChange, formatLabel } = props;

  const onSelectChange = (e) =&amp;gt; {
    const val = values.find((value) =&amp;gt; getStringFromValue(value) === e.target.value);

    if (val) onChange(val);
  };

  return (
    &amp;lt;select onChange={onSelectChange}&amp;gt;
      {values.map((value) =&amp;gt; (
        &amp;lt;option key={getStringFromValue(value)} value={getStringFromValue(value)}&amp;gt;
          {formatLabel(value)}
        &amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;
      ))}
    &amp;lt;/select&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-list-of-categories-implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The list of categories - implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, finally, time to implement what we refactored the select component for in the first place: categories for the website. As always, let’s start simple, and improve things in the process.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const tabs = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'];

const getSelect = (tab: string) =&amp;gt; {
  switch (tab) {
    case 'Books':
      return &amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Book&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; console.info(value)} values={books} /&amp;gt;;
    case 'Movies':
      return &amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; console.info(value)} values={movies} /&amp;gt;;
    case 'Laptops':
      return &amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Laptop&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; console.info(value)} values={laptops} /&amp;gt;;
  }
}

const Tabs = () =&amp;gt; {
  const [tab, setTab] = useState&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;(tabs[0]);

  const select = getSelect(tab);


  return (
    &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; onChange={(value) =&amp;gt; setTab(value)} values={tabs} /&amp;gt;
      {select}
    &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dead simple - one select component for choosing a category, based on the chosen value - render another select component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, not exactly typesafe, this time for the tabs: we typed them as just simple &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. So a simple typo in the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement will go unnoticed or a wrong value in &lt;code&gt;setTab&lt;/code&gt; will result in a non-existent category to be chosen. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, typescript has a handy mechanism to improve that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const tabs = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'] as const;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This trick is known as &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;const assertion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With this, our &lt;code&gt;tabs&lt;/code&gt; array, instead of an array of any random string will turn into a read-only array of those specific values and nothing else.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// an array of values type "string"
const tabs = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'];

tabs.forEach(tab =&amp;gt; {
  // typescript is fine with that, although there is no "Cats" value in the tabs
  if (tab === 'Cats') console.log(tab)
})

// an array of values 'Books', 'Movies' or 'Laptops', and nothing else
const tabs = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'] as const;

tabs.forEach(tab =&amp;gt; {
  // typescript will fail here since there are no Cats in tabs
  if (tab === 'Cats') console.log(tab)
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, all we need to do is to extract type &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; that we can pass to our generic select. First, we can extract the &lt;code&gt;Tabs&lt;/code&gt; type by using the &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;typeof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; operator, which is pretty much the same as normal javascript &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt;, only it operates on types, not values. This is where the value of &lt;code&gt;as const&lt;/code&gt; will be more visible:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const tabs = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'];
type Tabs = typeof tabs; // Tabs will be string[];

const tabs = ['Books', 'Movies', 'Laptops'] as const;
type Tabs = typeof tabs; // Tabs will be ['Books' | 'Movies' | 'Laptops'];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, we need to extract &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; type from the Tabs array. This trick is called &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/indexed-access-types.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“indexed access”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a way to access types of properties or individual elements (if array) of another type.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Tab = Tabs[number]; // Tab will be 'Books' | 'Movies' | 'Laptops'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Same trick will work with object types, for example we can extract Laptop’s id into its own type:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type LaptopId = Laptop['id']; // LaptopId will be string
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, that we have a type for individual Tabs, we can use it to type our categories logic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ySTyRutY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u2honjrewwmwhin6d5tg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ySTyRutY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u2honjrewwmwhin6d5tg.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="406"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now all the typos or wrong values will be caught by typescript! 💥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/eager-brook-vuj8d?file=/src/tabs.tsx"&gt;See full working example in the codesandbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-type-guards-and-is-operator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus: type guards and “is” operator
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another very interesting thing you can do with type guards. Remember our &lt;code&gt;getStringFromValue&lt;/code&gt; function?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = { id: string } | string;

const getStringFromValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    // here "value" will be the type of "string"
    return value;
  }

  // here "value" will be the type of "NOT string", in our case { id: string }
  return value.id;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;if (typeof value === ‘string')&lt;/code&gt; check is okay for this simple example, in a real-world application you'd probably want to abstract it away into &lt;code&gt;isStringValue&lt;/code&gt;, and refactor the code to be something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Base = { id: string } | string;

const isStringValue = &amp;lt;TValue&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; return typeof value === 'string';

const getStringFromValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; {
  if (isStringValue(value)) {
    // do something with the string
  }

  // do something with the object
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And again the same story as before, there is one problem with the most obvious solution: it’s not going to work. As soon as type guard condition is extracted into a function like that, it loses its type guarding capabilities. From typescript perspective, it’s now just a random function that returns a regular boolean value, it doesn’t know what’s inside. We’ll have this situation now:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const getStringFromValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; {
  if (isStringValue(value)) { // it's just a random function that returns boolean
    // type here will be unrestricted, either string or object
  }

  // type here will be unrestricted, either string or object
  // can't return "value.id" anymore, typescript will fail
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And again, there is a way to fix it by using yet another typescript concept known as &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“type predicates”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it’s a way to manually do for the function what typescript was able to do by itself before refactoring. Looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type T = { id: string };
// can't extend Base here, typescript doesn't handle generics here well
export const isStringValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends T&amp;gt;(value: TValue | string): value is string =&amp;gt; {
  return typeof value === 'string';
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;code&gt;value is string&lt;/code&gt; there? This is the predicate. The pattern is &lt;code&gt;argName is Type&lt;/code&gt;, it can be attached &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; to a function with a single argument that returns a boolean value. This expression can be roughly translated into "when this function returns true, assume the value within your execution scope as &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; type". So with the predicate, the refactoring will be complete and fully functioning:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type T = { id: string };
type Base = T | string;

export const isStringValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends T&amp;gt;(value: TValue | string): value is string =&amp;gt; {
  return typeof value === 'string';
};

const getStringFromValue = &amp;lt;TValue extends Base&amp;gt;(value: TValue) =&amp;gt; {
  if (isStringValue(value)) {
    // do something with the string
  }

  // do something with the object
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pattern like this is especially useful when you have a possibility of different types of data in the same function and you need to do distinguish between them during runtime. In our case, we could define &lt;code&gt;isSomething&lt;/code&gt; function for every one of our data types:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export type DataTypes = Book | Movie | Laptop | string;

export const isBook = (value: DataTypes): value is Book =&amp;gt; {
  return typeof value !== 'string' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'id' in value &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'author' in value;
};
export const isMovie = (value: DataTypes): value is Movie =&amp;gt; {
  return typeof value !== 'string' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'id' in value &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'releaseDate' in value &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'title' in value;
};
export const isLaptop = (value: DataTypes): value is Laptop =&amp;gt; {
  return typeof value !== 'string' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'id' in value &amp;amp;&amp;amp; 'model' in value;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then implement a function that returns option labels for our selects:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const formatLabel = (value: DataTypes) =&amp;gt; {
  // value will be always Book here since isBook has predicate attached
  if (isBook(value)) return value.author;

  // value will be always Movie here since isMovie has predicate attached
  if (isMovie(value)) return value.releaseDate;

  // value will be always Laptop here since isLaptop has predicate attached
  if (isLaptop(value)) return value.model;

  return value;
};

// somewhere in the render
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Book&amp;gt; ... formatLabel={formatLabel} /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Movie&amp;gt; ... formatLabel={formatLabel} /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;GenericSelect&amp;lt;Laptop&amp;gt; ... formatLabel={formatLabel} /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/immutable-wildflower-n4r8z?file=/src/tabs.tsx"&gt;see fully working example in the codesandbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#time-for-goodbye"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Time for goodbye
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing, how many advanced typescript concepts we had to use to implement something as simple as a few selects! But it’s for the better typing world, so I think it’s worth it. Let’s recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“keyof”&lt;/strong&gt; - use it to generate types from keys of another type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“as const”&lt;/strong&gt; - use it to signal to typescript to treat an array or an object as a constant. Use it with combination with &lt;strong&gt;“type of”&lt;/strong&gt; to generate actual type from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“typeof”&lt;/strong&gt; - same as normal javascript &lt;code&gt;“typeof”&lt;/code&gt;, but operates on types rather than values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Type['attr']&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Type[number]&lt;/code&gt; - those are &lt;strong&gt;indexed types&lt;/strong&gt;, use them to access subtypes in an Object or an Array respectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;argName is Type&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;type predicate&lt;/strong&gt;, use it to turn a function into a safeguard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it’s time to build a better, typesafe future, and we’re ready for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 84/100 CSS Color</title>
      <author>Rio Cantre</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:58:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/riocantre/day-84100-css-color-1dch</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/riocantre/day-84100-css-color-1dch</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A variety of color selection, not only specify colors in general but evaluate the whole concept of color syntax and usage of mixtures in details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IILl55Sp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ykxrorp781ah5wulj1pc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IILl55Sp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ykxrorp781ah5wulj1pc.png" alt="banner" width="726" height="250"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Named colors&lt;/em&gt; — English words that describe colors, also called &lt;em&gt;keyword colors&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;RGB&lt;/em&gt; — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;HSL&lt;/em&gt; — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dog-years"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dog Years
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year following equates to 4 dog years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-snippets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Snippets
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// current age
var myAge = 30;
// number of years
var earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears *= 10.5;

let laterYears = myAge - earlyYears;
laterYears *= 4;
let dogYear = laterYears * 4;
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

let myName = 'Riolette'.toLowerCase();

console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);
console.log(dogYear);
console.log(myAgeInDogYears);
console.log(myName);
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a11y-myths"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  a11y myths
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;We can quickly add accessibility before the release *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Won't work. Maybe easy things such as alternative text or form labeling may be added at the end, but some complex UX should be planned to be accessible. In some cases, making features accessible at the end of development process may require the full refactoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Climatetech looking for a CTO</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/adrienavril/climatetech-looking-for-a-cto-3j0d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I'm Adrien (blue shirt), I'm looking at a CTO for our ClimateTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm the cofounder of adapt, a tool that helps our thousand of users to reduce the GHG emission of their energy consumption by visualising the "electricity weather forecast". Our users in Europe consume electricity wisely : they reduce consumption when carbon intensity is higher ("peak demand"), and they post pone some electricity consumption when carbon intensity is lower (e.g. "smartcharging of electric vehicles"). Our beta tool works with manual actions of our users, and we're automatising the process for significant electric uses (e.g. HVAC &amp;amp; EV charging) and GHG emissions reduction calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our beta is available here: &lt;a href="https://dev.tourl"&gt;www.adapt.sh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started adapt with a friend of mine, working as part-time full stack developer, and we now have a junior full stack developer and some freelances. We have thousands of users and are working on some really interesting pilot projects with energy organisations. We're a non-profit and we're looking at a CTO willing to dedicate its coding skills to fighting climate change! Please send me an email at adrien [at] adapt.sh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current tech FYI: Languages: css (especially twitter bootstrap 4), javascript (very little...), php 7.x ; Framework: symfony 4.x ; Web hosting: docker (local), AWS elasticbeanstalk (production)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
