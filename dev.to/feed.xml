  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that fashion waves come and go in software development, just like everywhere else in life. When in the middle of such a wave, it is extremely difficult to raise any concerns about the actual main stream, canonical method or truth. Currently it is agile and functional programming. We have a tunnel vision, where we keep repeating '4 legs good, 2 legs bad'. This article attempts to go against the accepted and unchallenged, and look at a few pretty big cracks in the system, trying to come up with some recommendations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while now that I noticed a few things I did not like about how we write software. I started to collect these points, and was thinking about why we do things the way we do them, and how these individual aspects might correlate, catalysing each other. It is best if we start with the end product of it all, the software that we write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at a typical web application made in the past few years, you will notice the following few attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is using FP as programming paradigm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is using a framework like Redux for application logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has no noticeable software design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has tons of unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it has a layered organisation of files (services, actions, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you try to apply even the tiniest change to an application written like this, you immediately notice the following engineering principles all being violated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-Closed Principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liskov Substitution Principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface Segregation Principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency Inversion Principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, any functionality change needs to involve all the layers, actions, reducers, components, meaning lots of changes. Since there is a tendency to introduce dependencies between pieces of state in the reducer(s) these changes are all potentially risky - hence you need to put a load of unit tests in place to make sure things still work. Things are flat and open, there is no resistance in this software, people can do pretty much anything, software contracts, etc. are not expressed by any means. And they even think that this is a good thing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no noticeable design, that is, no entities, processes, interactions, the software is an unintelligible assembly of framework specific technicalities like actions and reducer functions that operate on atomic bits like a Boolean variable that has a particular meaning. Looking at this from ten thousand feet it looks as though we are again at the elementary level of assembly programming - our software is close to the iron (close to the framework and the DOM) and far away from the reality it is modelling. Yes, it seems history does repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of software will obviously be very costly to maintain. As I said before, simple functional changes will need to be woven through the fabric of the application (lots of changes, lots of unit tests) but larger changes, like supporting a different financial product with a slightly different set of attributes/behaviours will be painful due the complete lack of abstraction and tight coupling everywhere. I like to call this type of software shrink wrap software. It is tailor made to the exact set of requirements known at the time of writing the software, with absolutely zero flexibility to withstand or help with change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#under-the-hood"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Under the hood
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is driving all this? We all know that back in the 90s people started to feel that Waterfall doesn't really cut the mustard as it was unable to keep up with the fast changing business reality. By the way, this was the era of Object Oriented programming and software design (Design Patterns by GoF, etc. - apparently people had time for all that! :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, application development took another turn at the time, more like around the early 2000s. Web applications started to replace the heavy duty GUIs and their object oriented designs that were developed with costly waterfall methodology. The fast paced business world found its ideal match, functional programming and agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of agile is short term, the actual iteration, there is not much room for anything else. It is but natural that developers picked up a tool which is more proper for this type work, functional programming. Functional languages are good at small scale work, as in writing lots of small functions that can be combined to carry out more complicated work. Due to their dynamic nature they are also good for quick prototyping (funnily enough most prototypes in an Agile project end up being used as the real thing - clearly showing some confusion in the minds). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming, however, inherently is not so good at expressing larger scale designs. If you try to google for functional design patters you will find none. Everything is a function, end of story. You can play with scopes etc, but it is not idiomatic functional programming any more. Functional programming is wonderful, and it is very efficient for an array of things. It is a mistake however to try to use it for everything. It leads to the messy, unmaintainable codebases we call agile software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-way-out"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Way out
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I tried to show where I see the problems with modern software development. It is ephemeral, short sighted, lacks design and uses a tool that is inherently incapable of producing structured, reusable and maintainable software. So what shall we do, shall we go back to waterfall and Object Oriented languages? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that would hardly work, there was a reason for leaving all that behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things we need to take into account when trying to come up with a better way of crafting software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Businesses change rapidly, so only tools/metholodigies that are able to keep up will be viable&lt;br&gt;
2) Agile is unlikely to go away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming up with an application design for each new application is not really viable due to the points above, we need a better framework that allows us to craft software, component by component that blends into the super-structure of the application, which is easy to maintain over time. This is the exact opposite of things like Redux, where things melt away, as you keep adding more and more to the application. They dissolve into atomic pieces of the state and fragmented logic, which are very difficult to reason about. I think this is a key problem with Redux. It forces a brittle, fragmented architecture on your application - and there is a massive price to pay for this down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the way forward can be a plugin-like architecture, where you can develop pieces of functionality (yes, using FP if you like!) where these plugins provide clear integration points and APIs, and it is easy to see how they are assembled together to provide a piece of functionality. These plugins can then be easily reused in other application, since plugins are self-contained and encapsulated units of markup, state and async resources. Contrast this with the fragmented nature of modern web apps, with the entangled web of action creators, reducers, services, utilities, and UI components - where it is impossible to isolate anything for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plugin architecture will also help with testing, by allowing easy replacement of the dependencies these plugins declare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still a question, how much of this is possible to implement in TypeScript, which is tied to JavaScript which has some limitations around implementing these kind of 'meta' designs, which are based on indirection, inversion of control, decoupling and lazy/conditional loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is long overdue to come up with a better architecture and organisation for web applications. Finally we have a simple and elegant UI component framework, Svelte, but we are still suffering from an even bigger problem, not being able to model business problems in a clean, reusable and maintainable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposal is combine the good from both OO and FP to come up with a framework that allows rapid application development and yet it does not compromise on the maintainability of the resulting code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a daring proposition? &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Angular Mini Blog Series - Part 1</title>
      <author>Shreya Prasad</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 12:27:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shreyapd06/introducing-angular-mini-blog-series-part-1-4hdg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shreyapd06/introducing-angular-mini-blog-series-part-1-4hdg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog posts, we are going to learn about Angular from beginning. I will try to keep the blogs very short, crisp and easy to understand.&lt;br&gt;
Go to &lt;a href="https://angular.io/"&gt;Angular's official website&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn basic stuff like: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Angular is &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a basic application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Angular Live Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Directory Structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we will get started with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modules &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Angular Apps loads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AppModule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know about &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags and so on right? These are native HTML elements that are provided to us. But what if we could create our own HTML elements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/91fEJqgdsnu4E/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/91fEJqgdsnu4E/giphy.gif" alt="surprised-gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is where components come in! Components are typically custom built HTML elements, and each of these elements can instantiate only one component. &lt;br&gt;
The best part is - they are reusable, which means that one you create a component, you can utilize it multiple times in your application! Also, if you need to modify it, simply change one file and those changes will be reflected wherever you have used this component! Some popular examples of components are Navigation Bar, Footer, Side Menu etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rp8y73mK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://geeksarray.com/images/blog/Angular-Component-example.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rp8y73mK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://geeksarray.com/images/blog/Angular-Component-example.png" alt="component"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Modules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular is not present as one monolithic code base. Instead, it is divided into modules which are present in different locations and their utility is independent of each other. Modules provide the highest level of abstraction available within the Angular framework. Everything in your app is ultimately structured around modules. This is powerful! It means that you can easily encapsulate code within a module and share or reuse it throughout your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;strong&gt;@NgModule&lt;/strong&gt; decorator to declare a class as module.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;@NgModule&lt;/strong&gt; decorator contains below properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;declarations&lt;/strong&gt;: It includes component, directives, pipes that belongs to this module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;exports&lt;/strong&gt;: It include component, directives, pipes which can be accessible to other NgModule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;imports&lt;/strong&gt;: Contains Modules whose exported classes needed by this module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;providers&lt;/strong&gt;: Contains the services generated by this module.
bootstrap: Initialize root component
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppRoutingModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormsModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CoreModule&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-angular-app-loads"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Angular App loads?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5oGIwd_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5b3999l9ojj0b7h124sf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5oGIwd_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5b3999l9ojj0b7h124sf.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see this index.html? This is the page that's mainly rendered by Angular. It consists of only 1 component - &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;app-root&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;app-root&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the root component which encapsulates all the child components, i.e the components you create and bootstraps them to render everything inside it on index.html.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"utf-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Demo Angular App&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;base&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;app-root&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/app-root&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; //only this component will be present 
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#appmodule"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AppModule
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at the Angular module system, all things must begin with the app module. The root app module is a necessary portion of every Angular app. By default, this module is named AppModule, although it is possible to rename this module. The AppModule is the entry point to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newly generated AppModule would look like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/platform-browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./app.component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BrowserModule&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is a good practice to keep this file as minimal as possible. This can be done by importing only those modules that are absolutely necessary for your app to load initially. Or only declare Angular components, directives, or pipes that you want globally available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting Up Custom 404 Error Page</title>
      <author>Krutik Raut</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 11:50:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reboot13_dev/setting-up-custom-404-error-page-57c3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reboot13_dev/setting-up-custom-404-error-page-57c3</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-http-404-mean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does HTTP 404 mean?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, 404, 404 Error, Page Not Found or File Not Found error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Default 404 error pages are not good looking and don't have any type of navigations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some methods you can use to auto-redirect to a custom error page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website Running on Apache webserver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a custom webpage for 404 error and name it 404.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a file name &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File content: ErrorDocument {error_code}  {custom file path}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ErrorDocument 404 /404.html 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ErrorDocument 404 https://yourwebsite.com/404.html 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the site will redirect to 404.html whenever the user gets a 404 HTTP response or browse the wrong URL path on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some hosting services that run on Apache webserver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Hostinger&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Heroku&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Netlify&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;BlueHost&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&amp;amp;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Cloudways&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;SiteGround&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;HostGator&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website Hosted on Vercel.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a custom webpage for 404 error and name it 404.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a file name &lt;code&gt;vercel.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "status": 404, "dest": "/404.html" }
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website hosted on Github Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The simplest so far&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a custom webpage for 404 error and name it 404.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this file to your repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website running on Heroku&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a PHP app hosted on Heroku follow the same method as of Apache Server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a custom webpage for 404 error and name it 404.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run this command on Heroku CLI&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku config:set \ 
ERROR_PAGE_URL=//yourwebsite.com/public/404.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>What is a software blueprint?</title>
      <author>Jesse Jordan</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jayjayjpg/what-is-a-software-blueprint-5388</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-software-blueprint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a software blueprint?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;software blueprint&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;high-level plan&lt;/strong&gt; or outline used in the development of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the term blueprint is used in programming, it usually refers to one of two related, yet slightly different concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a high-level, graphical or written piece of &lt;strong&gt;documentation&lt;/strong&gt; of software architecture ("blueprint for &lt;strong&gt;humans&lt;/strong&gt;")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a piece of code serving as a template for &lt;strong&gt;code-generating tools&lt;/strong&gt; that build or configure applications ("blueprint for &lt;strong&gt;machines&lt;/strong&gt;")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, software blueprints are a powerful tool for planning, building and maintaining software projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And first, let's take a look into how software blueprints are used &lt;strong&gt;as documentation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blueprints-as-software-design-documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blueprints as software design documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blueprints may be used to &lt;strong&gt;design&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;document the architecture&lt;/strong&gt; of applications. It serves as a &lt;strong&gt;high-level representation of software design&lt;/strong&gt; that supports the development process in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the planning process of upcoming feature work, a blueprint communicates &lt;strong&gt;implementation requirements&lt;/strong&gt; across an engineering team more efficiently; a software architect may design a new feature and they can then use a blueprint to provide the feature requirements to the software engineers who will implement it later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, blueprints help teams consisting of both engineering and non-engineering professionals to collaborate on the development of business applications; blueprints empower stakeholders of either department to define requirements using common terminology that doesn't require in-depth, technical knowledge. This way, a &lt;strong&gt;software blueprinting process&lt;/strong&gt; reduces the number of cycles needed for planning, implementing and iterating on features by getting application requirements defined well from the beginning. This in turn helps to &lt;strong&gt;reduce the overall development time&lt;/strong&gt; of applications significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---FzTeeVY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qo9v1ctvqki1xy58mlhv.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---FzTeeVY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qo9v1ctvqki1xy58mlhv.jpg" alt="Title: An Architect in His Studio. Old ink drawing from the 19th century showing a man in a wealthy-looking coat sitting in front of his desk in his small studio room and working on a blueprint for a cathedral. You can see one of his employees in the background serving him tea"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this process, blueprints become an effective strategy for maintaining documentation of software architecture. As a business goes through the iterative process of blueprinting feature work upfront and implementing features according to the design, a growing documentation for the business's software architecture is created automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;Unified Modeling Language (UML)&lt;/strong&gt; software architects oftentimes visualize the design of the systems they and their team are implementing. Many products and open-source tools support software design with UML, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/"&gt;Papyrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/"&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/"&gt;Lucidchart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more insight into the rationale behind &lt;strong&gt;blueprints as documentation&lt;/strong&gt; and UML specifically, you may want to continue reading &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UmlAsBlueprint.html"&gt;"UmlAsBlueprint"&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler"&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the term blueprint isn't only used to describe software design plans that help &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; to implement said software. "Blueprint" also refers to those design plans that help &lt;strong&gt;computers&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;implement software automatically&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blueprints-as-automatic-programming-templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blueprints as automatic programming templates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;automatic programming&lt;/strong&gt; a computer program, when run, generates code automatically based on a specific configuration. The configuration for these &lt;strong&gt;code generators&lt;/strong&gt; can come from &lt;strong&gt;direct user input&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. parameters provided to a shell command) and - from &lt;strong&gt;blueprints&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nlBkK-RK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dz8f4r3b5m2v0uh0xjo0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nlBkK-RK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dz8f4r3b5m2v0uh0xjo0.jpg" alt="Old ink drawing of blueprints for the construction of the towers of the cathedral in Cologne, Germany"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the code generation process, the blueprint outlines the layout and configuration of the resulting program. This makes the blueprint useful in scaffolding and extending applications; a software engineer who uses blueprints in their development process can &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; on the implementation of the &lt;strong&gt;business logic&lt;/strong&gt; itself and worry less about how their implementation fits into the code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore when used as &lt;strong&gt;code generator templates&lt;/strong&gt;, blueprints improve the immediate developer experience significantly and can reduce overall development time. Lastly, they facilitate scaling and maintaining large applications by making extending applications easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many different tools and &lt;strong&gt;frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; already support blueprints and code generators for developers. This includes, for example and among many others, the &lt;a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/views/#create-a-blueprint"&gt;Python web framework Flask&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/"&gt;Blueprint visual scripting system of Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/blueprints/"&gt;JavaScript framework EmberJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blueprints-as-documentation-and-automatic-programming-tool"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blueprints as documentation and automatic programming tool
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blueprints are a &lt;strong&gt;powerful tool&lt;/strong&gt; in planning, documenting and implementing software applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blueprints - when used as documentation for software architecture - are critical for successfully planning and executing development cycles, whereas blueprints - when used as a template for code generators - are an integral part of maintaining and scaling code bases gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How much time should you spend on lowering your Bill of Materials? 📉🤔</title>
      <author>Valentin Sawadski</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 11:06:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/_vsaw/how-much-time-should-you-spend-on-lowering-your-bill-of-materials-1fjh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/_vsaw/how-much-time-should-you-spend-on-lowering-your-bill-of-materials-1fjh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;👉 tl/dr; Lower the BOM only to the point where you have a comfortable profit margin. Going lower than that is probably not worth it because of low production volumes, higher burn and longer time to market. 👈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at your Bill of Materials (BOM), I believe it's best to always put it into comparison with your profit margins. This will help you establish a "Max BOM" line. The number depends on a lot of different things like your business model and price, but rule of thumb for non-subscriptions models is at least: Price &amp;gt; 2x BOM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're above that "Max BOM" line, you'll need to figure out a way to either raise the price or lower your BOM. But we're going to focus on why it's not worth to go lower, with a small back of the envelope calculation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume you are are startup close to start production of your first batch, and then someone proposes to replace a few parts and save some money!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production Volume: 5k pcs&lt;br&gt;
BOM reduction: 10 EUR / piece&lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt;💰💰💰 50k EUR savings! 💰💰💰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that's a lot of money for a startup! ..... Except when you take implementation effort into account. Last minute HW changes can easily delay the timeline for 2 months, because you'll need&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~1 month to implement the new changes&lt;br&gt;
~1 month to build new prototypes and make sure everything still works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take your burn rate into account, it could easily be that you burn &amp;gt;25k EUR per Month in salaries, tools, prototypes etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this with your potential savings of 50k and you'll lose money in the end! Not to mention the 2 months sales revenue you miss out on! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore cost saving projects only start paying off when you've reached higher production volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, be careful when implementing cost saving projects early in your companies life. Most of the time your resources are better spent focusing on growing your revenue. 📈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you manage your BOM and cost-cutting initiatives?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SolidJs: First impression</title>
      <author>Edem Agbenyo</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 10:44:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/edemagbenyo/solidjs-first-impression-15pm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/edemagbenyo/solidjs-first-impression-15pm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using React.js for the past 3 years for various projects, and the main reason why I decided to do so were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to use JSX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power to create composable components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-way data binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reactivity and Virtual DOM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity and Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently explored SolidJS, a JS library framework and I discovered that you can do all these and even more. Here are my initial thoughts on SolidJS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SolidJS is a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It looks more like functional React components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has its own hooks, the difference being they start with &lt;code&gt;create*&lt;/code&gt; while React hooks start with &lt;code&gt;use*&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SolidJS has 2 main building blocks: JSX Components and Reactive Primitives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Components: just like in React are functions that accept props and return JSX elements or other components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Reactive Primitives are made up of Signals(equivalent to State in React), memos and Effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to SolidJS, as the above are my initial findings. I will be diving deeper into the topic in my subsequent articles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript : Arrays</title>
      <author>Vivek Alhat</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 10:43:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vivekalhat/javascript-arrays-4mkc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vivekalhat/javascript-arrays-4mkc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Variables can store only a single value at a time but what if you want to store multiple items at the same time? It is not efficient to create separate variables to store each item, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, we can store multiple items &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; using an array. An array is just a &lt;strong&gt;list-like&lt;/strong&gt; structure or a container that is used to store multiple elements irrespective of the data type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, you can create an array as given below,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let items = ["Apples", "Bananas", 2, 4, 8, "Purple", true, false]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An array is just a variable that stores a list. In the above line, we have created an items variable that contains a list of 8 items. All the items inside the array have different data types. You can create an array of strings, numbers, boolean, objects, or a combination of multiple types. An array does not care about the type of data that is stored inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also create an array that contains another array such as,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let items = [1, 2, 3, ["Apples", "Bananas"]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-syntax-for-creating-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The syntax for creating an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let/const/var arrayName = []&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An array name should not begin with a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An array is created using &lt;strong&gt;square brackets&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessing-elements-from-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessing elements from an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrays are &lt;em&gt;zero-indexed&lt;/em&gt;. It means that the first element inside an array is stored at index 0, the second element is stored at index 1, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to access the third element then you can do it by using the following expression,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let thirdElement = items[2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the thirdElement variable contains the value 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access an element from the array you have to specify the index of the element inside the square brackets i.e &lt;em&gt;arrayName&lt;/em&gt;[index].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the array is a list-like structure, you can use loops to access all elements from the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the length of an array you can use the length property of an array i.e &lt;code&gt;array.length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#foreach-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  forEach loop
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// for each loop is used to access each element present inside the array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for loop
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The above loop will print each item to the console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// items.length contains the value 5 because array contains 5 elements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// hence the loop will run until the value of i is less than 5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#modifying-array-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Modifying array elements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen how to create and access array elements. You can also modify the elements inside the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to modify the value of the third element and replace it with 10. You can do it by,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;items[2] = 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the array will be [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, you can reassign a value to any index inside the array. This property of an array is called mutability. It means that you can modify the elements inside the array.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#array-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Array Methods
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// get length of an array&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone 👋🏻,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, let us see how we can build an &lt;strong&gt;Exercise Planner Application using React.js&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E2%9C%8F-demo-for-the-project-amp-initial-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✏ Demo for the Project &amp;amp; Initial Setup
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdjZ3EGzGq0"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing you need to do is to create a new project. &lt;br&gt;
Make sure to install Node.js onto your system because we will be needing that for our project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using this tool for creating a new React Project : &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-react-app-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create React App : &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fgQl5Ae2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/avdjjay3se286tfkeaw8.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-nodejs-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Node.js : &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqbAi9PY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xg6c9yjpuxclt8nscyjc.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-new-react-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a new React Project
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To create a new React Project &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To run the project &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-react-router-dom-package"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install React Router DOM package
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dom&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-jsonserver-package-globally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install JSON-server package globally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using JSON-server for our project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-new-file-exercisesjson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a new file - exercises.json
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the file that will contain all the exercises that we will be needing in this application. This file will serve as a local JSON store for our application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#storedatajson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  store/data.json
&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"exercises"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Pushups"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"details"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Pushups are beneficial for building upper body strength. They work the triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders. When done with proper form, they can also strengthen the lower back and core by engaging (pulling in) the abdominal muscles"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"complete"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;119&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Inside a new terminal, run the json-server by running the command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;g&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;watch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3111&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the code for our entire project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt; - If you prefer learning React with a video. I do have a video on same where we create this exact project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this : &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/mayankpathak/temperature-monitoring-using-python-1bg5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys👋, so this post is going to be super excited and useful for those who are trying to find and implement some basic projects to increase and upscale their technical skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the simple projects, which I did during my college project season and it is super useful and easy to implement, with basic knowledge of python and some of the technical tools you can try out this project and can also list it to your Resume or CV, you can also take this project and show to your project’s coordinator during your project season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-the-project-about"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What’s the Project About?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KDOFs3D5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2vzwr8cgqys0rwjqzueq.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KDOFs3D5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2vzwr8cgqys0rwjqzueq.jpg" alt="Setup image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The project is about the Temperature Monitoring where we will monitor the temperature of a closed environment, for example – like a closed room. Since, Environment temperature should be a comfortable one, where the people can work comfortably and can go up to their efficiency and can work comfortably whether it is machinery or manpower. One of important factors that are needed be monitored is the temperature and humidity of the room, because if any one of the two goes mismatching it creates an unpleasing and uncomfortable environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-it-can-be-useful"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where it can be useful?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project has so many uses from a real-time perspective, let me list some of the uses-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be useful in a room where’s temperature needs to be in between certain range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A factory or industry where people cannot present at all the time and there’s temperature need to be fixed between certain range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While transporting some of the goods where they need to be in certain temperature range with limited power supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence these are some of the useful parts of the project where it can be implemented with full control over the temperature and best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-know-the-project-in-detail"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔎Let’s know the Project in Detail
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XGPu0IvC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c9qe7vas8zw84fjo4wxv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XGPu0IvC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c9qe7vas8zw84fjo4wxv.png" alt="Connection View"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Controlling temperature of a controlled environment is an important aspect of any workspace whether it is a commercial space or a domestic space. If temperature or humidity is either increased or decreased of any area, it becomes very difficult to be there and thus, if possible, should be kept in comfortable conditions at all times. One way to do it is to monitor and control the temperature of the closed surroundings using the concepts of Machine Learning and IoT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research’s purpose is the same to find an easy and an inexpensive way to find an alternative to it which is based on microcontroller, a Wi-Fi Module, Buzzer, few Temperature sensors and a Solderless board. The system is designed in such a way that the temperature can be monitored whether it is in the given range of temperature as prescribed by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also enabling to predict the temperature which will predict the temperature according to the temperature graph being made as by the input taken by the Temperature Sensors using Polynomial Regression Algorithm. Also, if the temperature of the enclosed area is not in the threshold range as suggested by the user, the System will automatically send a notification to user(s) via SMS, E-Mail or even through a Telegram Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note : To do this project completely you will need some technical tools and access to some of the software and online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main scope of this project is to measure the temperature of a closed environment let’s say we want to measure the temperature of a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a range is fixed that is, the minimum and maximum temperature values are fixed and if the measured value is not in this range, then the system alarms and sends a notification to the user’s device through SMS, email, telegram etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#components-required-to-work-the-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Components required to work the project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Bolt WiFi Module(microcontroller)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; LED (generic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Buzzer-to alarm the area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Jumper wires (generic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; LM35-temperature sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Breadboard (generic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using Z-Score analysis which also help in detecting the anomaly of the temperature sensor which means a variable’s value going beyond a certain range of values (upper and lower bound).These bound can be calculated using input values, frame size and multiplication factor, where frame size is minimum number of input values needed for Z-Score analysis and these predictions as well as the old values, all will be plotted on a graph, which the user can easily understand what could be the next game of plan. So, we going to use a formula to find any kind of anomaly that can happen in the proposed system.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nJceccBU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0zo7rnpj1iv2a52y702.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nJceccBU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0zo7rnpj1iv2a52y702.png" alt="Z Score Analysis"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So in the above listed formula,&lt;br&gt;
r = Frame Size &lt;br&gt;
C = Multiplication factor.&lt;br&gt;
To do so and implement the project, you have to register at a platform called Twilio this will help us to get the notification on the device. &lt;/p&gt;

  Conclusion of the Project
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project work is mainly to calculate the temperature of a closed environment and sends notification to the connected device through SMS, Mail, Telegram etc. only if the temperature of the region varies i.e., either the temperature increases or the temperature decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is also capable of displaying temperature, humidity and predicted temperature in real time through web-based application or through a Telegram Channel. For Alerts the system can send it through SMS, E-Mail or through a Telegram Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that some of you try to implement the project and if done then drop your experience in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Appwrite has released an article on how to backup and restore all data on your production server. You can read it here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/appwrite" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__org__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W4bSIRV8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7eMrR0VE--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/organization/profile_image/2225/eb541cf9-84f4-4101-987c-c219cd4b34fc.png" alt="Appwrite"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This article got me thinking 🤔 Sure, you can backup most MySQL databases into a simple &lt;code&gt;backup.sql&lt;/code&gt; file, but what if you have multiple massive projects inside Appwrite? Your disk storage may or may not be able to hold a backup of all Appwrite volumes. Additionally, you most likely need to backup periodically and need multiple versions of the backup. So, what are your options?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a complex bash script to keep last three versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throw all backups to a storage provider and let them take care of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should go with storage providers not only because they have a retention system already in place, also due to their experience in the field as they most likely care about security a lot and use raids to ensure your data won't get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this article as I was implementing this on my own production server, and I will show you everything you need to know about backing up &lt;strong&gt;Appwrite&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;Backblaze&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-backblaze-secrets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Backblaze secrets &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, what is Backblaze? Backblaze is one of the most, if not most, used commercial platform to backup your data for the lowest price possible. They provide solutions to backup your personal computer or your business data. The service we will be using is &lt;strong&gt;B2 Cloud Storage&lt;/strong&gt; as this gives our flexibility just like an actual hard drive. You don't have to worry about pricing yet because their free plan gives you 10GB of free space. To learn more about this product and its pricing, you can take a look at: &lt;a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html"&gt;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Over one exabyte of data storage under management, and counting." - Backblaze website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating an account and logging in (make sure to confirm your email), Backblaze may ask you to set up 2FA using your phone number for additional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Backblaze from our server, we will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BUCKET_NAME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APPLICATION_KEY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backblaze uses &lt;strong&gt;buckets&lt;/strong&gt; to store your data. In our case, we will only need one bucket as we will only back up two or three files at most (MySQL database and Appwrite Docker volumes). To create a bucket, navigate to &lt;code&gt;Bucket&lt;/code&gt; and press &lt;code&gt;Create a Bucket&lt;/code&gt;. Give it some name such as &lt;code&gt;appwrite&lt;/code&gt; and click &lt;code&gt;Create a Bucket&lt;/code&gt; again. You should see a newly created bucket on your list. Make sure to mark your &lt;code&gt;Bucket Name&lt;/code&gt; as we will need this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you enter &lt;code&gt;App Keys&lt;/code&gt;, you can &lt;code&gt;Add a New Application Key&lt;/code&gt;. For simplicity, we will ignore that, and we will use our master key to have all permissions. Simply click &lt;code&gt;Generate a New Master Application Key&lt;/code&gt;, and this should give you &lt;code&gt;keyID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;applicationKey&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wohoo 🎉 we have all secrets we need; let's continue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#b2-cli-basics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  B2 CLI basics &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure everything is working, let's try some simple action on B2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List files in a bucket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List files again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to have B2 CLI installed on our machine, but this can be easily avoided thanks to a Docker image &lt;code&gt;mtronix/b2-cli:0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;. This is the only image I could find that was actually working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To list all files in our bucket, we run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run \
  --rm \
  mtronix/b2-cli:0.0.1 \
  bash -c \
  "b2 authorize-account &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b2 list-file-names &amp;lt;BUCKET_NAME&amp;gt;"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output should be an empty list of files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "files": [],
  "nextFileName": null
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's upload a file 😎&lt;br&gt;
We need to have a file... I downloaded a cute cat image and saved it as &lt;code&gt;cat.png&lt;/code&gt;. To upload the file, I run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run \
  --rm \
  -v $PWD:/b2 \
  mtronix/b2-cli:0.0.1 \
  bash -c \
  "b2 authorize-account &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b2 upload-file &amp;lt;BUCKET_NAME&amp;gt; cat.png cat.png"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successful result should look something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "action": "upload",
  "fileId": "4_z78da5cd2a05db73574a90515_f11841831f8e91ca6_d20210717_m092603_c002_v0001140_t0056",
  "fileName": "cat.png",
  "size": 136021,
  "uploadTimestamp": 1626513963000
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, run the &lt;code&gt;list-file-names&lt;/code&gt; command from above again, and you should see your file in the array of files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "files": [
    {
      "accountId": "8ac20d754955",
      "action": "upload",
      "bucketId": "78da5cd2a05db73574a90515",
      "contentLength": 136021,
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backblaze let you do all of this function manually on their website. Exercise for you 😲 Remove our test file from the bucket. Do it however you want - you can remove it using B2 CLI or manually on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#appwrite-mariadb-backblaze"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Appwrite MariaDB 👉 Backblaze &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an Appwrite MariaDB backup, you run this command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose exec mariadb sh -c 'exec mysqldump --all-databases --add-drop-database -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p "$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"' &amp;gt; ./dump.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Source: Appwrite article mentioned earlier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To backup this export into Backblaze, I created a script that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export MariaDB data to &lt;code&gt;dump.sql&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload &lt;code&gt;dump.sql&lt;/code&gt; to Backblaze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove &lt;code&gt;dump.sql&lt;/code&gt; to free up the space on the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the script looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose exec \
  mariadb \
  sh -c \
  'exec mysqldump --all-databases --add-drop-database -u"$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"' &amp;gt; ./dump.sql ; \
  docker run \
  --rm \
  -v $PWD:/b2 \
  mtronix/b2-cli:0.0.1 \
  bash -c \
  "b2 authorize-account &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b2 upload-file &amp;lt;BUCKET_NAME&amp;gt; dump.sql dump.sql" ; \
  rm dump.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each time you run this script, it will backup your MariaDB database into Backblaze. Backblaze can store multiple versions of a single file; just make sure to configure retention on a bucket, for example, 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#appwrite-docker-volumes-backblaze"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Appwrite Docker Volumes 👉 Backblaze &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, let's get our base command from Appwrite's article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before running these commands is it highly recommended to shut down your Appwrite instance to ensure you get a complete backup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p backup &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker run --rm --volumes-from "$(docker-compose ps -q appwrite)" -v $PWD/backup:/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /storage/uploads &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar cvf /backup/uploads.tar ."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p backup &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker run --rm --volumes-from "$(docker-compose ps -q appwrite)" -v $PWD/backup:/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /storage/functions &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar cvf /backup/functions.tar ."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These two commands will backup two different volumes. The first one back up all files in Appwrite storage while the second one backup your function tags. Let's start with backing up uploads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with MariaDB, we will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a backup in &lt;code&gt;backup/uploads.tar&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the file to Backblaze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the backup file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full command to do this is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p backup &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker run \
  --rm \
  --volumes-from "$(docker-compose ps -q appwrite)" \
  -v $PWD/backup:/backup \
  ubuntu \
  bash -c \
  "cd /storage/uploads &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar cvf /backup/uploads.tar ."  ; \
  docker run \
  --rm \
  -v $PWD:/b2 \
  mtronix/b2-cli:0.0.1 \
  bash -c \
  "b2 authorize-account &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b2 upload-file &amp;lt;BUCKET_NAME&amp;gt; backup/uploads.tar upload_backup.tar" ; \
  rm dump.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This should create a file called &lt;code&gt;upload_backup.tar&lt;/code&gt; in your Backblaze bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise time 💪 You will need to backup Appwrite functions too! Using all knowledge from this article, you should be able to prepare a command that will do it.&lt;br&gt;
If you are here only to copy&amp;amp;paste commands, here is the command:&lt;br&gt;

  Command to backup Appwrite function to Backblaze
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p backup &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker run \
  --rm \
  --volumes-from "$(docker-compose ps -q appwrite)" \
  -v $PWD/backup:/backup \
  ubuntu \
  bash -c \
  "cd /storage/functions &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar cvf /backup/functions.tar ."  ; \
  docker run \
  --rm \
  -v $PWD:/b2 \
  mtronix/b2-cli:0.0.1 \
  bash -c \
  "b2 authorize-account &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b2 upload-file &amp;lt;BUCKET_NAME&amp;gt; backup/functions.tar upload_functions.tar" ; \
  rm dump.sql
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;That's it! I hope this article helped you backing up your Appwrite server. If you have &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; questions, feel free to join Appwrite's Discord server and chat with their &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; community: &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/discord"&gt;https://appwrite.io/discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Best Way to Compare Two Dictionaries in Python</title>
      <author>Miguel Brito</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 10:00:15 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/miguendes/the-best-way-to-compare-two-dictionaries-in-python-3g9l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python's dictionary is a very versatile data structure. We can use it for many tasks that require a key-&amp;gt;value mapping. A &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; is not only efficient in terms of performance but also easy to use. Despite its admitted strengths, specific operations are somewhat tricky. For example, Python has no built-in feature allowing us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare two dictionaries and check how many pairs are equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the difference between two &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if the dictionaries are equal, specially if when they have nested structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;s that have floating-point numbers as values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will show how you can do those operations and many more, so let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why You Need a Robust Way to Compare Dictionaries
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine the following scenario: you have two simple dictionaries. How can we assert if they match? Easy, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! You could use the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator, off course!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's kind of expected, the dictionaries are the same. But what if some value is different, the result will be &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; but can we tell where do they differ?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hum... Just &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; doesn't tell us much...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;'s inside the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say that we want to ignore their cases.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ONE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oops...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the number was a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and we consider two floats to be the same if they have at least 3 significant digits equal? Put another way, we want to check if only 3 digits &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the decimal point match.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.00001&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You might also want to exclude some fields from the comparison. As an example, we might now want to remove the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; key-&amp;gt;value from the check. Unless we create a new dictionary without it, there's no method to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't it get any worse? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, what if a value is a &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; array?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'array'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'array'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;                                &lt;span class="n"&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipython&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eeadcaeab874&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;----&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;truth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;than&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ambiguous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh no, it raises an exception in the middle of our faces!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn it, what can we do then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-the-right-tool-for-the-job"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using the Right Tool for the Job
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;s cannot perform advanced comparisons, there are only two forms of achieving that. You can either implement the functionality yourself or use a third party library. At some point in your life you probably heard about not reinventing the wheel. So that's precisely what we're going to do in this tutorial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll adopt a library called &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/diff.html"&gt;zepworks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; can pick up the difference between dictionaries, iterables, strings and other objects. It accomplishes that by searching for changes in a recursively manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; is not the only kid on the block, there's also &lt;a href="https://dictdiffer.readthedocs.io/"&gt;Dictdiffer&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the folks at CERN. &lt;code&gt;Dictdiffer&lt;/code&gt; is also cool but lacks a lot of the features that make &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; so interesting. In any case, I encourage you to look at both and determine which one works best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-a-simple-difference"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting a Simple Difference
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we'll be solving the first example I showed you. We want to find the key whose value differs between the two &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;s. Consider the following code snippet, but this time using &lt;code&gt;deepdiff&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;deepdiff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'values_changed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"root['number']"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'new_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'old_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome! It tells us that the key &lt;code&gt;'number'&lt;/code&gt; had value 1 but the new &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;, b, has a new value, 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ignoring-string-case"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ignoring String Case
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our second example, we saw an example where one element of the list was in uppercase, but we didn't care about that. We wanted to ignore it and treat &lt;code&gt;"one"&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;"ONE"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve that by setting &lt;code&gt;ignore_string_case=True&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'ONE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ignore_string_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we don't do that, a very helpful message is printed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'values_changed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"root['list'][0]"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'new_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="s"&gt;'old_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'ONE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing Float Values
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also saw a case where we had a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; number that we only wanted to check if the first 3 significant digits were equal. With &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; it's possible to pass the exact number of digits AFTER the decimal point. Also, since &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s differ from &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;'s, we might want to ignore type comparison as well. We can solve that by setting &lt;code&gt;ignore_numeric_type_changes=True&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;

  Comparing &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; Values
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tried comparing two dictionaries with a &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; array in it we failed miserably. Fortunately, &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; has our backs here. It supports &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; objects by default!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the arrays are different?&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;span class="s"&gt;'new_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It shows that not only the values are different but also the types!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-dictionaries-with-raw-datetime-endraw-objects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing Dictionaries With &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; Objects
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common use case is comparing &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; objects. This kind of object has the following signature:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;microsecond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tzinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In case we have a &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; objects, &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; allows us to compare only certain parts of it. For instance, if only care about year, month, and day, then we can truncate it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;deepdiff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s"&gt;'date'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;513371&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'one'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'two'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s"&gt;'date'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;115791&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;truncate_datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'day'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-string-values"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing String Values
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've looked at interesting examples so far, and it's a common use case to use &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;s to store strings values. Having a better way of contrasting them can help us a lot! In this section I'm going to explain you another lovely feature, the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; diff.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pprint&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'text'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'hi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; my awesome world!'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'text'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'hello, my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; dear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; world!'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ddiff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;verbose_level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ddiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;indent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'values_changed'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"root['text']"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'diff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'--- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'+++ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'@@ -1,3 +1,2 @@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'-hello, my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'- dear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'- world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'+hi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                &lt;span class="s"&gt;'+ my awesome world!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'new_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'hi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; my awesome world!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                                        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'old_value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'hello, my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                     &lt;span class="s"&gt;' dear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
                                                     &lt;span class="s"&gt;' world!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's nice! We can see the exact lines where the two strings differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#excluding-fields"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Excluding Fields
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this last example, I'll show you yet another common use case, excluding a field. We might want to exclude one or more items from the comparison. For instance, using the previous example, we might want to leave out the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'text'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'hi,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; my awesome world!'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'number'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;'text'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'hello, my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; dear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; world!'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ddiff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;verbose_level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exclude_paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"root['text']"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...:&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ddiff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want even more advanced exclusions, &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; also allow you to pass a regex expression. Check this out: &lt;a href="https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/exclude_paths.html#exclude-regex-paths"&gt;https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/current/exclude_paths.html#exclude-regex-paths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for today, folks! I really hope you've learned something new and useful. Comparing &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;'s is a common use case since they can used to store almost any kind of data. As a result, having a proper tool to easy this effort is indispensable. &lt;code&gt;DeepDiff&lt;/code&gt; has many features and can do reasonably advanced comparisons. If you ever need to compare &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt;'s go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why TypeScript is useful</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can say why I think TypeScript could be useful. But it's only when I personally find a use for something that I really understand why it's useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my code I had a function that set the number of decimal places of a number. Here's a simplified version in JavaScript:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toFixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This takes in 'key', changes it to have 2 decimal places, then returns it. Perfectly fine and you might be wondering what the problem with that is. Well, TypeScript told me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the same code in TypeScript:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toFixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All I've said here is that key is a number and the function returns a number. Which is what we want. But it's not what we're getting. TypeScript immediately complains that I've said the function is returning a number, but it's returning a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is crazy, surely toFixed returns a number. But no, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed"&gt;MDN clearly states otherwise:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;toFixed() returns a string representation of numObj &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed my return value to be a number, due to things I was doing with it later. If I hadn't been using TypeScript I'd have spent time trying to find the problem. TypeScript told me exactly what the problem was, so I could fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using it for a little while, as I knew, in the abstract, that it was useful. Now I'm a convert.&lt;/p&gt;
