      <title>4 Key Observability Metrics for Distributed Applications</title>
      <author>Michael Bogan</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:39:34 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/mbogan/4-key-observability-metrics-for-distributed-applications-4d27</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common architectural design pattern these days is to break up an application monolith into smaller microservices. Each microservice is then responsible for a specific aspect or feature of your app. For example, one microservice might be responsible for serving external API requests, while another might handle data fetching for your frontend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing a robust and fail-safe infrastructure in this way can be challenging; monitoring the operations of all these microservices together can be even harder. It's best not to simply rely on your application logs for an understanding of your systems' successes and errors. Setting up proper monitoring will provide you with a more complete picture, but it can be difficult to know where to start. In this post, we'll cover service areas your metrics should focus on to ensure you're not missing key insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before Getting Started
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to make a few assumptions about your app setup. Don't worry—you don't need to use any specific framework to start tracking metrics. However, it does help to have a general understanding of the components involved. In other words, how you set up your observability tooling matters less than what you track. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a sufficiently large set of microservices requires some level of coordination, we're going to assume you are using&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt; Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; for orchestration. We're also assuming you have a time series database like&lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/"&gt; Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.influxdata.com/"&gt; InfluxDB&lt;/a&gt; for storing your metrics data. You might also need an ingress controller, such as&lt;a href="https://konghq.com/solutions/kubernetes-ingress/?utm_source=guest&amp;amp;utm_medium=devspotlight&amp;amp;utm_campaign=community"&gt; the one Kong provides&lt;/a&gt; to control traffic flow, and a service mesh, such as&lt;a href="https://kuma.io/"&gt; Kuma&lt;/a&gt;, to better facilitate connections between services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before implementing any monitoring, it's essential to know how your services actually interact with one another. Writing out a document that identifies which services and features depend on one another and how availability issues would impact them can help you strategize around setting baseline numbers for what constitutes an appropriate threshold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-metrics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Metrics
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to see data points from two perspectives: Impact Data and Causal Data. Impact Data represents information that identifies who is being impacted. For example, if there's a service interruption and responses slow down, Impact Data can help identify what percentage of your active users is affected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Impact Data determines &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is being affected, Causal Data identifies &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is being affected and why. Kong Ingress, which can monitor network activity, can give us insight into Impact Data. Meanwhile, Kuma can collect and report Causal Data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a few data sources and explore the differences between Impact Data and Causal Data that can be collected about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#latency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Latency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency is the amount of time it takes between a user performing an action and its final result. For example, if a user adds an item to their shopping cart, the latency would measure the time between the item addition and the moment the user sees a response that indicates its successful addition. If the service responsible for fulfilling this action degraded, the latency would increase, and without an immediate response, the user might wonder whether the site was working at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To properly track latency in an Impact Data context, it's necessary to follow a single event throughout its entire lifetime. Sticking with our purchasing example, we might expect the full flow of an event to look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer clicks the "Add to Cart" button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The browser makes a server-side request, initiating the event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server accepts the request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A database query ensures that the product is still in stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database response is parsed, a response is sent to the user, and the event is complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To successfully follow this sequence, you should standardize on a naming pattern that identifies both what is happening and when it's happening, such as &lt;code&gt;customer_purchase.initiate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;customer_purchase.queried&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;customer_purchase.finalized&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. Depending on your programming language, you might be able to provide a function block or lambda to the metrics service:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;statsd.timing('customer_purchase.initiate') do
  # ...
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By providing specific keywords, you ought to hone in on which segment of the event was slow in the event of a latency issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking latency in a Causal Data context requires you to track the speed of an event between services, not just the actions performed. In practice, this means timing service-to-service requests:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;statsd.histogram('customer_purchase.initiate') do
  statsd.histogram('customer_purchase.external_database_query') do
    # ...
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shouldn't be limited to capturing the overall endpoint request/response cycles. That sort of latency tracking is too broad and ought to be more granular. Suppose you have a microservice with an endpoint that makes internal database requests. In that case, you might want to time the moment the request was received, how long the query took, the moment the service responded with a request, and the moment when the originating client received that request. This way, you can pinpoint precisely how the services communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#traffic"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Traffic
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your application to be useful and popular—but an influx of users can be too much of a good thing if you're not prepared! Changes in site traffic can be difficult to predict. You might be able to serve user load on a day-to-day basis, but events (both expected and unexpected) can have unanticipated consequences. Is your eCommerce site running a weekend promotion? Did your site go viral because of some unexpected praise? Traffic variances can also be affected by geolocation. Perhaps users in Japan are experiencing traffic load in a way that users in France are not. You might think that your systems are working as intended, but all it takes is a massive influx of users to test that belief. If an event takes 200ms to complete, but your system can only process one event at a time, it might not seem like there's a problem—until the event queue is suddenly clogged up with work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to latency, it's useful to track the number of events being processed throughout the event's lifecycle to get a sense of any bottlenecks. For example, tracking the number of jobs in a queue, the number of HTTP requests completed per second, and the number of active users are good starting points for monitoring traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Causal Data, monitoring traffic involves capturing how services transmit information to one another, similar to how we did it for latency. Your monitoring setup ought to track the number of requests to specific services, their response codes, their payload sizes, and so on—as much about the request and response cycle as necessary. When you need to investigate worsening performance, knowing which service is experiencing problems will help you track the possible source much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-rates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Error Rates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking error rates is rather straightforward. Any 5xx (or even 4xx) issued as an HTTP response by your server should be tagged and counted. Even situations that you've accounted for, such as caught exceptions, should be monitored because they still represent a non-ideal state. These issues can act as warnings for deeper problems stemming from defensive coding that doesn't address actual problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuma can capture the error codes and messages thrown by your service, but this represents only a portion of actionable data. For example, you can also capture the arguments which caused the error (in case a query was malformed), the database query issued (in case it timed out), the permissions of the acting user (in case they made an unauthorized attempt), and so on. In short, capturing the state of your service at the moment it produces an error can help you replicate the issue in your development and testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#saturation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Saturation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should track the memory usage, CPU utilization, disk reads/writes, and available storage of each of your microservices. If your resource usage regularly spikes during certain hours or operations or increases at a steady rate, this suggests you’re overutilizing your server. While your server may be running as expected, once again, an influx of traffic or other unforeseen occurrences can quickly topple it over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kong Ingress only monitors network activity, so it's not ideal for tracking saturation. However, there are&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/"&gt; many tools available&lt;/a&gt; for tracking this with Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementing-monitoring-and-observability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementing Monitoring and Observability
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, we've discussed the kinds of metrics that will be important to track in your cloud application. Next, let’s dive into some specific steps you can take to implement this monitoring and observability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-prometheus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Prometheus
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prometheus is the go-to standard for monitoring, an open-source system that is easy to install and integrate with your Kubernetes setup. Installation is especially simple if you use &lt;a href="https://helm.sh/"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we create a &lt;code&gt;monitoring&lt;/code&gt; namespace:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ kubectl create namespace monitoring
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we use Helm to install Prometheus. We make sure to add the Prometheus charts to Helm as well::&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
$ helm repo update
$ helm install -f https://bit.ly/2RgzDtg -n monitoring prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The values file referenced at &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2RgzDtg"&gt;https://bit.ly/2RgzDtg&lt;/a&gt; sets the data scrape interval for Prometheus to ten seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enable-prometheus-plugin-in-kong"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enable Prometheus Plugin in Kong
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you are using Kong Ingress Controller (KIC) for Kubernetes, your next step will be to create a custom resource—a &lt;code&gt;KongPlugin&lt;/code&gt; resource—which integrates into the KIC. Create a file called &lt;code&gt;prometheus-plugin.yml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongClusterPlugin
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: kong
  labels:
    global: "true"
plugin: prometheus
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-grafana"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Grafana
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grafana is an observability platform that provides excellent dashboards for visualization of data scraped by Prometheus. We use Helm to install Grafana as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ helm install grafana stable/grafana -n monitoring --values http://bit.ly/2FuFVfV
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can view the bit.ly URL in the above command to see the specific configuration values for Grafana that we provide upon installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enable-port-forwarding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enable Port Forwarding
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Prometheus and Grafana are up and running in our Kubernetes cluster, we'll need access to their dashboards. For this article, we'll set up basic port forwarding to expose those services. This is a simple—but not very secure—way to get access, but not advisable for production deployments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace monitoring -l "app=prometheus,component=server" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace monitoring  port-forward $POD_NAME 9090 &amp;amp;

$ POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace monitoring -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=grafana" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward $POD_NAME 3000 &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above two commands expose the Prometheus server on port &lt;code&gt;9090&lt;/code&gt; and the Grafana dashboard on port &lt;code&gt;3000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those simple steps should be sufficient to set you off and running. With Kong Ingress Controller and its integrated Prometheus plugin, capturing metrics with Prometheus and visualizing them with Grafana are quick and simple to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you need to investigate worsening performance, your Impact Data metrics can help orient you on the magnitude of the problem: it should tell you how many people are affected. Likewise, your Causal Data identifies what isn't working and why. The former points you to the plume of smoke, and the latter takes you to the fire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of the above, you should also consider the rate at which your metrics are changing. For example, say your traffic numbers are increasing. Observing how quickly those numbers are moving can help you determine when (or if) it'll become a problem. This is essential for managing upcoming work with regular deployments and changes to your services. It also establishes what an ideal performance metric should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/"&gt;Google wrote an entire book on site reliability&lt;/a&gt;, which is a must-read for any developer. If you're already running Kong alongside your clusters, plugins&lt;a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus"&gt; such as this one&lt;/a&gt; integrate directly with Prometheus, which means less configuration on your part to monitor and store metrics for your services.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use Kool to run Multiple Docker Applications at the same time in your Local Development Environment</title>
      <author>Fabrício José Souza</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:30:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kooldev/use-kool-to-run-multiple-docker-applications-at-the-same-time-in-your-local-development-environment-5ec6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kooldev/use-kool-to-run-multiple-docker-applications-at-the-same-time-in-your-local-development-environment-5ec6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more, we find ourselves working with Docker containers in the context of microservice architectures comprising multiple, loosely-coupled applications and services, and/or projects made up of two or more distinct apps running side-by-side talking to each other via APIs. As developers who work on these types of projects know all too well, setting up your local development environment to run &lt;strong&gt;multiple&lt;/strong&gt; Docker applications &lt;strong&gt;at the same time&lt;/strong&gt; can be a real hassle. Developing each app &lt;strong&gt;on its own&lt;/strong&gt; is a breeze &lt;a href="https://blog.kool.dev/article/using-docker-for-local-development/"&gt;using Kool and Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt;. However, when you need to run multiple apps at the same time, configuring the routing and intercommunication between different containers can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll show you how to set up your local environment to run more than one Docker application at the same time using Kool and a Caddy web server. No doubt, this is just one of several ways to solve for this use case, but we think it's an approach that works really well for most projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you start, if you haven't done so already, you need to &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/getting-started/installation"&gt;install Docker and &lt;strong&gt;Kool CLI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also wouldn't hurt to quickly get up-to-speed with the &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/commands/kool"&gt;Kool CLI commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kool&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a CLI tool that makes local development with Docker super easy. Kool CLI will level up your development workflow, and help you and your team improve the way you develop and deploy cloud native applications. Make sure you're always using the latest version by running &lt;code&gt;kool self-update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#it-always-starts-off-simple"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It always starts off simple
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a single application with its Docker Compose environment. Let's call it &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-1
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create the two files we need:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# App 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ~/multiple-apps/app-1/docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kooldev/php:8.0-nginx&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;80:80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.:/app/public&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# App 1
# ~/multiple-apps/app-1/index.php
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Welcome to App 1!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these two files, you can now get &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt; up and running using &lt;code&gt;kool start&lt;/code&gt;, and check the status of its service container using &lt;code&gt;kool status&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool start
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Creating network "app-1_default" with the default driver
Creating app-1_app_1 ... done

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool status
&lt;span class="go"&gt;+---------+---------+---------------------------------------------+---------------+

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl localhost
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Welcome to App 1!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome! Your &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; service container is running, &lt;code&gt;kool status&lt;/code&gt; shows that port 80 is mapped from your host to the container, and &lt;code&gt;curl localhost&lt;/code&gt; successfully returns the output of &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-then-it-starts-getting-tricky"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But then it starts getting tricky
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your project evolves over time, you need to add a second application called &lt;strong&gt;App 2&lt;/strong&gt;, which runs alongside &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, to work on the project, &lt;strong&gt;you need to run &lt;em&gt;both apps&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;same time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's quickly set up &lt;strong&gt;App 2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-2
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once again, let's create the two files we need (inside the &lt;code&gt;app-2&lt;/code&gt; directory):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# App 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ~/multiple-apps/app-2/docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kooldev/php:8.0-nginx&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;80:80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.:/app/public&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# App 2
# ~/multiple-apps/app-2/index.php
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Welcome to App 2!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, when you try to get &lt;strong&gt;App 2&lt;/strong&gt; up and running (using &lt;code&gt;kool start&lt;/code&gt;), you run into a problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool start
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Creating network "app-2_default" with the default driver
Creating app-2_app_1 ...
Creating app-2_app_1 ... error

ERROR: for app-2_app_1  Cannot start service app: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint app-2_app_1 (24719704f55491122a18f051d3f1e789b6afc3f34ccf7bfe3d7eac510117ef42):

ERROR: for app  Cannot start service app: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint app-2_app_1 (24719704f55491122a18f051d3f1e789b6afc3f34ccf7bfe3d7eac510117ef42):
  Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As per the error message, you have a port conflict (&lt;code&gt;Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;You cannot have two different containers bound to the same port on your host&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you continue, let's stop your &lt;strong&gt;App 2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt; containers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-2 &lt;span class="c"&gt;# you should already be here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool stop
&lt;span class="go"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-1
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-so-fast"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not so fast!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this error, your first impulse is probably to use different ports for each service. For example, you can run &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;code&gt;localhost:8081&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;App 2&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;code&gt;localhost:8082&lt;/code&gt;. However, you'll quickly realize this solution isn't viable because it's not flexible enough, and doesn't provide intercommunication between applications over a shared Docker network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#proxy-to-the-rescue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Proxy to the rescue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proxy design pattern provides a much better solution for running multiple Docker applications at the same time in your local development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-a-global-network-to-docker-compose"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add a global network to Docker Compose
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to improve the Docker Compose environments used by each of your apps. Using one of the many best practices built into the Docker configurations included with &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/presets/introduction"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool Presets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, let's create a &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#networks"&gt;shared network between Docker containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, all containers in a &lt;strong&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/strong&gt; file will share the same virtual network. This means two different applications will not have a channel of communication. For this reason, Kool Presets will usually have &lt;strong&gt;two networks&lt;/strong&gt; for each container: &lt;code&gt;kool_local&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kool_global&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kool_local&lt;/code&gt; is a local network that's only available to the group of containers from that &lt;strong&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/strong&gt; file. It's the same as the default network (if we didn't specify the network ourselves).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kool_global&lt;/code&gt; is a global network created outside the scope of any particular &lt;strong&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/strong&gt; file. It's available system-wide, and any containers running on the host can join it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create an external &lt;code&gt;kool_global&lt;/code&gt; network inside each Docker Compose environment, and add each app to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# App 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ~/multiple-apps/app-1/docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kooldev/php:8.0-nginx&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;expose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.:/app/public&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;kool_global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;aliases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;app-1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;kool_global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# App 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ~/multiple-apps/app-2/docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kooldev/php:8.0-nginx&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;expose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.:/app/public&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;kool_global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;aliases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;app-2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;kool_global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that we replaced the &lt;code&gt;ports&lt;/code&gt; configuration with &lt;code&gt;expose&lt;/code&gt;. You don't want these &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; containers bound to the host anymore, in order to avoid a conflict. Instead, you want to bind a single container to the host, which proxies each request internally over the &lt;code&gt;kool_global&lt;/code&gt; network to the correct service container using its network &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#networks"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aliases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; key on the container network works like a &lt;strong&gt;domain name&lt;/strong&gt; that resolves to that container's address when used within the same network. This is a great way to normalize names for service containers that need to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-the-proxy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set up the proxy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, we're going to use a &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/"&gt;Caddy web server&lt;/a&gt; as our reverse proxy. It's our first choice because it has a simple configuration interface and a rich feature set. &lt;a href="https://traefik.io/"&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt; or Nginx would work great too, so feel free to use what you like best when you implement this solution in a real project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by creating a &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Caddyfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; configuration file in a new &lt;code&gt;proxy&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/proxy
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/proxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight conf"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# ~/multiple-apps/proxy/Caddyfile
&lt;/span&gt;{
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;auto_https&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse_proxy&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
}

&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="n"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse_proxy&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;://&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that we use the &lt;code&gt;app-1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;app-2&lt;/code&gt; container network aliases to point to each destination, based on the incoming &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; request (&lt;code&gt;a.localhost&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;b.localhost&lt;/code&gt;). You should also add these local domains to your &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file: &lt;code&gt;echo "127.0.0.1 a.localhost b.localhost" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Caddy tries to use &lt;code&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; for all hosts. For this tutorial, we're disabling it. We'll cover local TLS usage in a future article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let's create a new &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; for Caddy itself:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ~/multiple-apps/proxy/docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;caddy:2-alpine&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;80:80&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kool_global&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;kool_global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it. You're done configuring your proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all you need to do is spin up your &lt;strong&gt;App 1&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;App 2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Proxy&lt;/strong&gt; service containers (using &lt;code&gt;kool start&lt;/code&gt; of course), and verify it works by sending a couple of test requests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight console"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Proxy
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/proxy &lt;span class="c"&gt;# you should already be here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool start
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Creating proxy_proxy_1 ... done

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;App 1
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-1
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool start
&lt;span class="go"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;App 2
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/multiple-apps/app-2
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kool start
&lt;span class="go"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-H&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Host: a.localhost"&lt;/span&gt; http://localhost
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Welcome to App 1!

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-H&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Host: b.localhost"&lt;/span&gt; http://localhost
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Welcome to App 2!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;W00t! You now have &lt;strong&gt;both apps up and running &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You can access them using different host names, and they can also communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clean up your local environment, you'll need to move into each directory (&lt;code&gt;app-1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;app-2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;proxy&lt;/code&gt;) and run &lt;code&gt;kool stop&lt;/code&gt;, and then remove the directories you created: &lt;code&gt;rm -r ~/multiple-apps&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#next-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kool's core team is already working on a new set of commands to make the above steps seamless and transparent, so you don't have to worry about the details.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are writing automated tests (and I sure hope you do), you most likely also create a lot of mock-data to feed into the functions under test. With this post I want to show you how to do this in a scalabe, reusable and focused way by using a mock-factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-initial-simple-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The initial simple way
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting a new project or test-suite, creating mock-data usually starts out very simple by using object literals:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;markTodoAsDone sets done to true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Write an awesome post about Testdata-Patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultingTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;markTodoAsDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deepStrictEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultingTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, as your project grows, your data usually grows as well. New properties and behaviours are added, and you will quickly realize that the method above does not scale well. Everytime a new property is introduced, you have to revisit every single test and adjust the testdata-object. Depending on the size of your project, that might be a dozen or even hundreds of required adjustments because of a single change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the example above actually has another issue - can you spot it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it becomes clearer once we actually add some new properties:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;markTodoAsDone sets done to true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Write an awesome post about Testdata-Patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;dueDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2021-07-04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;David Losert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Writing Blogposts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultingTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;markTodoAsDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deepStrictEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultingTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right, with pure object literals you actually have to specifiy all the properties of the object all the time - even if only one of those is relevant for the unit under test. That is a lot of distraction. Tests should be precise, focused and only contain the data and properties currently required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#alternative-ways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Alternative ways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the alternative, you might ask? I have seen quite some, but they usually only address parts of the problem or introduce new ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting test-objects into their own files&lt;/strong&gt; This might remove the distraction - but it also removes the property the test is about. Also, it does not help you with the sclaing issue - on the contrary. Creating a file for every test or maybe different test scenarios, you now have to go into every file whenever something on the source type is changed. And it becomes quite a mess pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casting with TypeScript's &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While this most certainly works, it leaves a bit of a bad taste as it is actually cheating the type system, thus openning the door to nasty and hard to track bugs. If the function under test expects a &lt;code&gt;Todo&lt;/code&gt;, we should provide a full-fledged object and not just a partial one. Maybe the unit under test relies on a ceratin property not being undefined even though it's not really relevant for the test (thinking of a 'stub'). Plus you have to type &lt;code&gt;as Thing&lt;/code&gt; everywhere which again is quite a bit of a distraction in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spreading on a default object&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In a separe file or on top of your test file...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Default Todo Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;dueDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2021-07-04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;David Losert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Writing Blogposts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;markTodoAsDone sets done to true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This heads into a better direction. The test remains focused on the relevant properties, yet our unit under test always gets a real &lt;code&gt;Todo&lt;/code&gt;-object as opposed to when casting. It also scales somewhat: changes to the type only have to be applied to the &lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt;-object. And we get another bonus: the &lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt; serves as a great documentation on how a real &lt;code&gt;Todo&lt;/code&gt;-object might look in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains a tiny problem with this approach: Your tests are now tightly coupled to the &lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt;-object, which might again introduce problems with - you might have guessed it - scaling. And I wouldn't write this if I did not know of a slightly better approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enter-the-stage-typescripts-raw-partial-endraw-and-a-factoryfunction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enter the stage: Typescripts &lt;code&gt;Partial&lt;/code&gt; and a factory-function
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the way I usually go is a combination of typescript's &lt;code&gt;Partial&lt;/code&gt; and a simple factory function. I'll show you the code before going into the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;createMockTodo.ts&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Default Todo Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dueDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2021-07-04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;David Losert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Writing Blogposts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The usage of might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;todo.test.ts&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;markTodoAsDone sets done to true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultingTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;markTodoAsDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unfinishedTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deepStrictEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resultingTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So there is a few things happening here, let me walk you through the most important ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt; is basically the same as in the section before: A fully defined object of the type to make it easy to always get all (required) properties from a single place. Additional advantage: It serves as documentation about the type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But rather than exporting this object directly, we use a factory function &lt;code&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/code&gt;. This gives us way more control over how the actual mock-object is constructed. You will see how this helps us further down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Partial&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a TypeScript utility type that accepts another &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Interface&lt;/code&gt; as generic argument (if you don't know about generics, I recommend you read the &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html"&gt;official docs&lt;/a&gt;). It then creates a new type by copying all properties of the given generic input type but with all properties set to optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lets us pass in a object with only the properties of our choosing (as we did with &lt;code&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; in the example) while at the same time keeping type-safety turned on. We can only pass things that actually exist in &lt;code&gt;Todo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use an empty object as deafult argument to &lt;code&gt;overwrites&lt;/code&gt; so that we can also call the factory-function without any parameters. This is especially useful if you just need some stubs in your test but don't care about the precise properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then finally construct the test-object by merging together all properties of &lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;overwrite&lt;/code&gt; object using the spread-operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this, all properties given to the function will overwrite the ones in &lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt; (as the name indicates) while leaving the other properties in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-of-this-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages of this pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It sclaes&lt;/strong&gt;: when adding new properties to the original type, you only have to adjust the default-Object in a single place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It sclaes again&lt;/strong&gt;: If for any reason you need to construct the mock-data differently (e.g. because of deeply nested structures, see below), you are completely free to do so within the factory-function without having to change any callers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type-safety&lt;/strong&gt; is on at all times. This prevents you from introdcuing nasty bugs as well as making refactorings easy, especially with IDEs that support things like renamings (Hit &lt;code&gt;F2&lt;/code&gt; in VSCode ;) ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It's immutable&lt;/strong&gt;: As long as you don't have nested objects (see below on how to handle those), you are guaranteed to get a new copy for every test, preventing another sort of nasty bugs where tests might influence each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It's documentation&lt;/strong&gt;: Give the default-object meaningful values and you have a documentation on how it might look like in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It's reusable&lt;/strong&gt;: This pattern can be used in a lot of different scenarios - it is actually not even limited to data-objects as you might find out if you read on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extending-the-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extending the pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern as shown is already useful in a lot of ways. But I promised you scaling, so let me show you how further extended it for more special use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-mockfactories-in-other-mockfactories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use mock-factories in other mock-factories
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say we introduce a &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;-Type in our App that might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;User.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;pronouns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We then create a mock-factory for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;createMockUser.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;29f51e42-c6ca-4f17-ac93-7131eeb4cffc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Kim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Su&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;pronouns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;they/them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we want to adjust our &lt;code&gt;Todo.assignee&lt;/code&gt;-Property to use this type rather than a string:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todo.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;dueDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will break all our tests at first, so we quickly adjust the default-object in the &lt;code&gt;Todo&lt;/code&gt;-Factory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;createMockTodo.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./createMockUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Default Todo Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dueDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2021-07-04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Writing Blogposts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that's it. Our tests should work again, given they did not involve or overwrite the user object. And if they did, we can now easily find them through our typechecks (or by following the failed tests for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example imagine we had a test like this before the change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Todo.test.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;changes the assignee to the new given user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;givenTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;David Losert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;actualUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assignTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;givenTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rahim Vera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deepStrictEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;actualUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Rahim Vera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we could write it like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;changes the assignee to the new given user.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;givenTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;oldId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expectedUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;newId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;actualUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assignTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;givenTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expectedUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deepStrictEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;actualUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expectedUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful though: Now that we use nested objects, we are actually able to mutate the values within the &lt;code&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myFirstTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myFirstTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Logs 'Kim'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;myFirstTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;MutatedName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mySecondTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mySecondTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assignee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Now Logs 'MutatedName'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is due to the fact that the spread-operator only does a shallow copy of an object, but passes deep nested objects by reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not too bad if we are actually certain that we are using immutabilty throughout our app. But if not, there is the option of deep cloning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-raw-clonedeep-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use &lt;code&gt;cloneDeep&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there actually is no standard way of deep cloning an object in JavaScript / TypeScript, we'll either have to implement it ourselfs or use a library that does it for us. For the simplicity of this post, I will be using the &lt;code&gt;cloneDeep&lt;/code&gt;-function provided by &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash"&gt;lodash&lt;/a&gt;, since it is probably the most popular one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do not want the full lodash-library in our project, we can also do a standalone install of the &lt;code&gt;cloneDeep&lt;/code&gt; function and mark it as a dev-dependency (so long as we only use it in our tests):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt; lodash.clonedeep @types/lodash.clonedeep
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please note that you will have to add &lt;code&gt;"esModuleInterop": true&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;compilerOptions&lt;/code&gt;-section of your &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; to be able use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all that is left todo (pun intended) is to adjust the mock-factory accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;createMockTodo.ts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneDeep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;lodash.clonedeep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMockTodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Todo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cloneDeep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultTodo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that's it. Now you have a truly immutable mock-factory. Note how we did not have to adjust any tests or other areas of the code to make this central change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sum-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sum up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown, the mock-factory-pattern is a big win in scalibility and focus for creating test-data while at the same time being pretty simple. The simplicity makes it reusable for almost every object, and I even use it sometimes to mock IO-Modules like HTTP-Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same pattern for all test-data makes writing tests more approchable, and it is especially helpful for newcomers to the project as they can see default implementations of all the relevant data and types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having a mix of a default-object and a factory-function, it becomes super flexible while at the same time minimizing maintenance tasks and the need for more static mock code. To put this into perspective: I once was able to delete ten thousands of lines of code from a project simply by introducing this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are still a lot of other ways to use and extend it, but I'll leave it up to you to find and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#link-to-working-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Link to working example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a working example of the code in my Github repository:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;

        mock-factory-pattern
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      This repository shows the mock-factory-pattern and accompanies my blog-post about it.
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
Mock-Factory-Pattern in TypeScript&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository shows a mock-factory-pattern-example in typescript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mock-factory-pattern uses a combination of TypeScript's &lt;code&gt;Partial&lt;/code&gt; together with a factory function to be able to create scalabe, reusable and focused test data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-ts position-relative js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;defaultObject&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;ExampleType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;key1&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'value1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;key2&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'value2'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;createMockObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;ExampleType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  ...&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;defaultObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  ...&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;overwrites&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;createMockObject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find two implementations of this pattern here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davelosert/mock-factory-pattern/main/readme.md/./src/createMockUser.ts"&gt;src/createMockUser.ts&lt;/a&gt;: simple example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davelosert/mock-factory-pattern/main/readme.md/./src/createMockTodo.ts"&gt;src/createMockTodo.ts&lt;/a&gt;: example using &lt;code&gt;cloneDeep&lt;/code&gt; to ensure immutability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about it in my &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davelosert/mock-factory-pattern/main/readme.md/tbd."&gt;blog-post&lt;/a&gt; which this repository accompanies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To execute the tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone this repository and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into it on your terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/davelosert/mock-factory-pattern"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What's New in Codesphere Version 1.13.0</title>
      <author>Saji Wang</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:16:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codesphere/what-s-new-in-codesphere-version-1-13-0-1gaf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codesphere/what-s-new-in-codesphere-version-1-13-0-1gaf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we are sure that you saw, Github finally built the singularity! Jokes aside, we have exciting news.. we just released v1.13.0 as the latest version of Codesphere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest release includes new features to further improve your Codesphere experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  New Features
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom Plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to give feedback via Fider​&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fixes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fixes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved the look and feel of our code search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate the terminal and file tree faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#custom-plan"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Custom Plan
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what your apps need best, so Codesphere now allows you to pick the exact computing power for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m-Ntc199--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9jx4l6z8fu6yp7p72lqa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m-Ntc199--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9jx4l6z8fu6yp7p72lqa.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With custom plans, in addition to having our existing three tiers - Basic, Awake, and Boost, you can now select exactly how much storage, memory, and processing speed you want for your app, and only pay for what you really need&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, in keeping with our mission of making scaling your app seamless, you can adjust these values at any point for when you experience sudden user growth.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fider
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Codesphere, our users are the center of our design process. That's why you can now suggest features for Codesphere on our Fider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedback.codesphere.com/"&gt;https://feedback.codesphere.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if someone has already voiced your concern or suggestion for improvement, you can upvote their comment.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improved-code-search-and%C2%A0terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improved Code Search and Terminal
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we've done a number of notable bug fixes and improvements. Most notably, we've improved the look and feel of code search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5peuoAPZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6hr5nz73pl6lahso6ezl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5peuoAPZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6hr5nz73pl6lahso6ezl.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we've made our terminal and file tree work much faster. Our average IDE startup time is 70% faster, down to 17 seconds from a previous of 58 seconds. We'll be continuing to reduce these load times to make your Codesphere experience smoother.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thank-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thank You!
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team is working hard to make Codesphere easier and even more enjoyable to use. Stay tuned for future releases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for using &lt;a href="https://link.codesphere.com/BC"&gt;Codesphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Methods</title>
      <author>Eduardo Julião</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:06:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/eduardojuliao/methods-588f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/eduardojuliao/methods-588f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we write code to our software, it can get messy and complicated, to solve this issue, we break small parts of our software into &lt;code&gt;methods&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
A method is a block of instructions that are executed only when it's called, you can pass parameters to it and have it return a value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a method
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A method has the follwing structure:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;access&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;modifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paramenters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This an exmaple of a method that can be accessed by everyone, indicated by the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; access modifier.&lt;br&gt;
Does not have a return, indicate by the &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;br&gt;
Has a name of &lt;code&gt;WriteToConsole&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
And recieves one parameter, indicated by &lt;code&gt;string message&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;WriteToConsole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the method &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt;, it recieves to paramenters &lt;code&gt;value1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;value2&lt;/code&gt;, both of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and returns the sum of both paramenters, indicated by the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#breaking-down-these-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Breaking down these examples
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#access-modifier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Access Modifier
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Access Modifier&lt;/code&gt; defines how the code can access part of your code. They are used not only for methods, but for classes, properties, enums, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C# there are four types of access modifiers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Modifier&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;private&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The code can only be accessed inside the same class.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;public&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The code can be accessed for everyone.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;internal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The code can only be accessed.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;protected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The code can only be accessed inside the same class or classes that inherit from the declaring class.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also combine them, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Accessed public inside the project&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Accessed inly by classes that inherit an inside the same project&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;internal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#static-vs-instance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Static vs Instance
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A method that are not defined as static by the &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; keyword, is always an instance method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#instance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Instance
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access an &lt;code&gt;Instance&lt;/code&gt; method, first, you need to instantiate an object and it works with the instance data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's use our calculator class as an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, to exemplify what instance data are, let's modify our calculator class, our new calculator class, will have the properties X and Y, and a parameterless method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Prints 15&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Prints 42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#static"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Static
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A static method is a unique to the application, meaning that everyone will use the same copy of the method. These methods lives in the Type level instead of a Instance level.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// calling a static method.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An instance class can have multiple static/instance methods.&lt;br&gt;
A static class can only have static methods and members.&lt;br&gt;
A static method cannot be called from an instance of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#return-types"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Return Types
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A method can return a value to its caller, the type returned by the method are indicated before the method name, and they must have the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword. &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; methods does not return a value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ExecuteAndDoesNotReturnAValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ExecuteAndReturnsAValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"This method has a return value"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parameters-and-arguments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parameters and Arguments
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parameters are the options listed in the method signature. Arguments are the values passed to the method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The method signatures has parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In this case, two paramenters, x and y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// When calling the method, we pass **arguments** to its **paramenters**&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// in this scenario, we are passing 5 to x and 6 to y&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#polymorphism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Polymorphism
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism is when the same method has multiple functionalities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Calculator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// returns the sum of a and b&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns the sum of a, b and c&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the example the calculator class have two methods to add values, one that recieves 2 arguments, and another one that recieves 3 arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developed a web app to convert images to Pokémon ASCII art style</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/yuiko/developed-a-web-app-to-convert-images-to-pokemon-ascii-art-style-mb7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys 👋👋👋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have developed a web app, that converts images to Pokémon ASCII art style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yOFNGpkM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dc0qhmr31a0x2idhpgxs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yOFNGpkM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dc0qhmr31a0x2idhpgxs.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;website: &lt;a href="https://poke.art-creator.net/"&gt;https://poke.art-creator.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/yuikoito/poke-art-creator"&gt;https://github.com/yuikoito/poke-art-creator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m9ScsKIT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/670446/677c7bea-2923-2a9d-a9b3-1e5dce6029c5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m9ScsKIT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/670446/677c7bea-2923-2a9d-a9b3-1e5dce6029c5.jpeg" alt="1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href="https://poke.art-creator.net/"&gt;https://poke.art-creator.net/&lt;/a&gt;, then upload an image whatever you want to convert Pokémon ASCII art style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just three step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Convert button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't even need to log in, so have a look and enjoy freely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loading-animation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loading animation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gyazo.com/04c8921ac368199485969f97e26aea2c"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_OMF2_vP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.gyazo.com/04c8921ac368199485969f97e26aea2c.gif" alt="Image from Gyazo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the monster ball as a loading animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/afif/another-100-css-loaders-for-your-next-project-352l"&gt;the article of Mr. Temani Afif&lt;/a&gt;, I got a good animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#image-compression"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Image compression
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, due to the fact that the API processing part is very heavy, the images are compressed on the front side and sent.&lt;br&gt;
The same process is applied in &lt;a href="https://art-creator.net/"&gt;ArtCreator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
The image processing system needs to be as light as possible before sending it, otherwise it will take a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a description of the process.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Canvasの描画して画像をリサイズする
 * @param {object} image - Imageオブジェクト
 * @param {number} limitWidth - 最大横幅
 * @param {number} limitHeight - 最大縦幅
 * @returns {string} - base64
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resizeImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;aspect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 規定サイズよりも画像が大きい場合&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;aspect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 横長画像の場合&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 縦長画像の場合&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitWidth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasHeight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;limitHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canvasWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Hack Any Email Account With A Phishing Link</title>
      <author>Mr. Unity Buddy</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:03:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/hack-any-email-account-with-a-phishing-link-fm6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/hack-any-email-account-with-a-phishing-link-fm6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, buddies! I think you will understand the purpose of this tutorial. So, today we're going to hack a email with a phishing link without coding. Wait, what's a phishing? Well, you might know that. However, let's learn about it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only for educational purposes. I won't take any responsibility to any crimes that you do with this way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-phishing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is phishing?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OLyqAkGm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620456847339/HHDkQ2Lzz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OLyqAkGm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620456847339/HHDkQ2Lzz.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Several things can occur by clicking the link. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user is redirected to myuniversity.edurenewal.com, a bogus page appearing exactly like the real renewal page, where both new and existing passwords are requested. The attacker, monitoring the page, hijacks the original password to gain access to secured areas on the university network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user is sent to the actual password renewal page. However, while being redirected, a malicious script activates in the background to hijack the user’s session cookie. This results in a reflected XSS attack, giving the perpetrator privileged access to the university network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today we're hacking email to get IP address, password, Username etc. Don't use it in wrong methods!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#smiktanet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://smikta.net/"&gt;Smikta.net&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-smiktanet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Smikta.net?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smikta.net is an online website that is very similar to the z-shadow that offers users to hack Email, Instagram and Facebook accounts. It gets attention when z shadow stops working. It is popular all around the world but the following five countries browse the site more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algeria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viet Nam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colombia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venezuela&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is not 100% accurate because most people access these types of sites using a VPN. Before Smikta, z-shadow.info was the king among phishing websites but it shut downed in 2020.  Z shadow was making money with ads. Because z shadow was illegal that’s why using popular ad network that can provide good income wasn’t an option. Z shadow users were also interested in the hacking, they rarely click on the ad. Which turn low income. So, This could be the reason why Z shadow went down. However, we have smikta now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-hacking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start Hacking
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Hh-30RV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620459608580/InI2KMJFU.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7Hh-30RV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620459608580/InI2KMJFU.gif" alt="hack.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-your-phishing-link"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get your phishing link
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, you need to go to &lt;a href="https://smikta.net/"&gt;smikta.net&lt;/a&gt;. You will be directed to home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, you need to create an account. To create an account you need to enter a username, password, email, age, and choose any country. Sometimes, it will give an error. Then, you have to change usernames, email or anything.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U95UUoki--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620457586448/w80VxzDIo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U95UUoki--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620457586448/w80VxzDIo.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I recommend NOT to add your real e-mail since it doesn't give anything to verify or something and we're not sure this is 100% safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you enter all information save it and login with the same username and password. You’ll redirect to the page like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BTHDLAQU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620457893077/5k9Mmds1u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BTHDLAQU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620457893077/5k9Mmds1u.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select what you want. I will choose email. Next to the link photo, there are 3 flags which represent languages. Choose UK flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R0O_LzWL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620457995577/pOPAryY4z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R0O_LzWL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620457995577/pOPAryY4z.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you will directed to a page like this,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lshuj36w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458062465/0eDSZZM5L.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lshuj36w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458062465/0eDSZZM5L.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Copy the link and you're done! Victim's info will be in 'My Victims' tab once they signed in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tease-the-victim"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tease The Victim 😁
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we should make Victim to click this link. If he/she is a friend of you it is easy.(I'm not telling you to hack your friends accounts..) So here I'm going to use a my friend who is a crazy about BTS😂. Since she doesn't know anything about hacking it is super easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open email and compose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type a text that will attract him/her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Inladn4h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458663869/kXvuZbBaa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Inladn4h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458663869/kXvuZbBaa.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you've included a Hyperlink, instead of showing original link. Original link is somewhat perplex. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JTYIckZK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458813656/OnNBYSUg7.png" alt="image.png"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is the full email that I sent. I'm a great astute buddy 🙈🙈&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xbN70Ej2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458967875/0KERmbtyH.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xbN70Ej2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620458967875/0KERmbtyH.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is how you can hack someone's email through a phishing link and this the same way that you can be hacked through phishing. Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a Fullstack Next.js App with Authentication, Data, and Storage</title>
      <author>Ali Spittel</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:02:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aspittel/create-a-fullstack-next-js-app-with-authentication-data-and-storage-47od</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aspittel/create-a-fullstack-next-js-app-with-authentication-data-and-storage-47od</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next.js is one of my favorite tools for web development -- but it's a frontend framework. How can you build a fullstack application with it? In this tutorial, we'll build a Server-side Rendered Next.js app with a database-backed backend, static image storage, and authentication. It'll be National Park themed -- signed in users will be able to create new parks, and everyone will be able to view all added parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're new to Next.js, &lt;a href="https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-nextjs/"&gt;I wrote a tutorial on how to get started with it&lt;/a&gt;. If you're new to AWS Amplify, &lt;a href="https://welearncode.com/first-fullstack-app/"&gt;here's a tutorial on that as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GsObT64SRhA"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-your-app-backend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create your app Backend
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a new Next app:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app national-parks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the Amplify CLI installed, if not follow &lt;a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/next#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; instructions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, initialize Amplify for your project. You should be able to accept the configuration it generates for you and then select your AWS profile or enter your access keys.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;amplify init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we'll configure the needed services. First we'll add authentication.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;amplify add auth
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Answer the ensuing questions like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we'll add storage to our app. Select the default configuration options for all questions other than who should have access -- there, give authenticated users access to all actions and unauthenticated users the ability to read data.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;amplify add storage

? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: s37cd140d1
? Please provide bucket name: nationalparkbrowser248f6fd94d4f46f99a951df475e8
? Who should have access: Auth and guest users
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? create/update, read, delete
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users? read
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? No
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll create an API. We'll select GraphQL and use an API key for authorization. Open up the GraphQL schema in your text editor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;amplify add api

? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: GraphQL
? Provide API name: nationalparks
? Choose the default authorization type for the API API key
? Enter a description for the API key:
? After how many days from now the API key should expire (1-365): 7
? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API No, I am done.
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? No
? Choose a schema template: Single object with fields (e.g., “Todo” with ID, name, description)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your schema.graphql file didn't open in your text editor, open it up. It will be under &lt;code&gt;amplify/backend/api/nationalparks&lt;/code&gt;. There will be a sample GraphQL schema already in there, but we'll edit it to have the data format we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll create two models: S3Object and Park. &lt;code&gt;Park&lt;/code&gt; will store our parks -- each park will have an id, a name, and an image. That image will reference an image stored in Amazon S3 (we created a bucket when we ran &lt;code&gt;amplify add storage&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;S3Object&lt;/code&gt; will have information about the image stored on S3 -- it's bucket, region, and key. We'll use the key to access the images in our app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type S3Object {
  bucket: String!
  region: String!
  key: String!
}

type Park @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  image: S3Object
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now run &lt;code&gt;amplify push&lt;/code&gt; to deploy your resources to the cloud! You now have a fully deployed backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install the Amplify libraries. These will allow us to use JavaScript helper code and React components to expedite our frontend development.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once our backend is deployed, we'll need to link our frontend to our backend using &lt;code&gt;Amplify.configure()&lt;/code&gt;. We'll use the configuration information in the &lt;code&gt;src/aws-exports.js&lt;/code&gt; file that's automatically generated by Amplify and also make sure to set the &lt;code&gt;ssr&lt;/code&gt; flag to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; so that we can pull from our API on the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add this to the top of your &lt;code&gt;pages/_app.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import config from '../src/aws-exports'

Amplify.configure({ ...config, ssr: true })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend-logic"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frontend Logic
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! Done with configuration code, now we can write our frontend React logic. Let's first create a form in order to create a new park. Create a file &lt;code&gt;pages/create-park.js&lt;/code&gt; that will house a page that will render our form. Create a React component in the file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// create-park.js
function CreatePark () {
  return &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Create Park&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
}

export default CreatePark
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, we'll use the &lt;code&gt;withAuthenticator&lt;/code&gt; higher-order component to require sign in before going to the &lt;code&gt;/create-park&lt;/code&gt; page. It will also enable sign up and require account confirmation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// create-park.js
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'

function CreatePark () {
  return &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Create Park&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
}

export default withAuthenticator(CreatePark)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we'll create a React form where a user can input the name of the park and an image.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// create-park.js
import { useState } from 'react'
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'

function CreatePark () {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [image, setImage] = useState('')

  const handleSubmit = async () =&amp;gt; {

  }

  return (
    &amp;lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Create a Park&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label htmlFor='name'&amp;gt;Name&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type='text' id='name' onChange={e =&amp;gt; setName(e.target.value)} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label htmlFor='image'&amp;gt;Image&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type='file' id='image' onChange={e =&amp;gt; setImage(e.target.files[0])} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type='submit' value='create' /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
  )
}

export default withAuthenticator(CreatePark)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll implement the &lt;code&gt;handleSubmit&lt;/code&gt; function which will upload the user's image to S3 and then store our newly created park in our data base using our GraphQL API. We'll import the configuration information from the &lt;code&gt;aws-exports.js&lt;/code&gt; again and one of the GraphQL mutations that Amplify generated in the &lt;code&gt;src/graphql&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we'll upload the image using &lt;code&gt;Storage.put()&lt;/code&gt; with the image's name as the key and the image itself as the value. Then, we'll use &lt;code&gt;API.graphql&lt;/code&gt; to run the graphQL mutation with the user's inputted data and configuration information about the S3 bucket.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// create-park.js
import { useState } from 'react'
import { API, Storage } from 'aws-amplify'
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'

import { createPark } from '../src/graphql/mutations'
import config from '../src/aws-exports'

function CreatePark () {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [image, setImage] = useState('')

  const handleSubmit = async e =&amp;gt; {
    e.preventDefault()
    // upload the image to S3
    const uploadedImage = await Storage.put(image.name, image)
    console.log(uploadedImage)
    // submit the GraphQL query 
    const newPark = await API.graphql({
      query: createPark,
      variables: {
        input: {
          name,
          image: {
            // use the image's region and bucket (from aws-exports) as well as the key from the uploaded image
            region: config.aws_user_files_s3_bucket_region,
            bucket: config.aws_user_files_s3_bucket,
            key: uploadedImage.key
          }
        }
      }
    })
    console.log(newPark)
  }

  return (
    &amp;lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Create a Park&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label htmlFor='name'&amp;gt;Name&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type='text' id='name' onChange={e =&amp;gt; setName(e.target.value)} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label htmlFor='image'&amp;gt;Image&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type='file' id='image' onChange={e =&amp;gt; setImage(e.target.files[0])} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;input type='submit' value='create' /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
  )
}

export default withAuthenticator(CreatePark)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want, here are a few lines of CSS you can paste into the &lt;code&gt;styles/globals.css&lt;/code&gt; file to make the app look a little more presentable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;amplify-s3-image {
  --width: 70%;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.container {
  max-width: 1000px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 2rem;
  text-align: center;
}

.img-square img h2 {
  margin: 0 auto;
  text-align: center;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll list all of the parks on the index page. We'll use the &lt;code&gt;listParks&lt;/code&gt; graphql query that was generated in &lt;code&gt;src/graphql/queries.js&lt;/code&gt; to fetch the parks and the &lt;code&gt;AmplifyS3Image&lt;/code&gt; component to render the images on the page. We'll fetch the parks on the server-side so that our app will dynamically update when new parks are added.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import Head from 'next/head'
import { withSSRContext } from 'aws-amplify'
import { listParks } from '../src/graphql/queries'
import { AmplifyS3Image } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
import Link from 'next/link'

export async function getServerSideProps () {
  const SSR = withSSRContext()
  const { data } = await SSR.API.graphql({ query: listParks })
  return {
    props: {
      parks: data.listParks.items
    }
  }
}

export default function Home ({ parks }) {
  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Head&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;National Parks&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/Head&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div className='container'&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;National Parks &amp;lt;Link href='/create-park'&amp;gt;(+)&amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div className='img-grid'&amp;gt;
          {parks.map(park =&amp;gt; {
            return (
              &amp;lt;div key={park.id} className='img-square'&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{park.name}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
                {/* use the AmplifyS3Image component to render the park's image using its S3 key */}
                &amp;lt;AmplifyS3Image imgKey={park.image.key} height='200px' /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
            )
          })}
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  )
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend-deployment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frontend Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our app has a complete frontend! Let's deploy it via Amplify hosting. Push your code to a GitHub repository, then open up the &lt;a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify"&gt;Amplify Console&lt;/a&gt; for your app. Click on the &lt;code&gt;frontend environments tab&lt;/code&gt; and then the &lt;code&gt;connect app&lt;/code&gt; button. Choose your repository, use the auto generated configuration, and &lt;code&gt;save and deploy&lt;/code&gt;. It'll take a few minutes and then your app will be live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No extra configuration is needed, Amplify will infer that you're creating a SSR Next.js app and deploy the needed hosting resources for your app. &lt;a href="https://welearncode.com/deploy-nextjs-amplify/"&gt;Here's more information&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cleanup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cleanup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not want to keep the app deployed, in which case you can click the &lt;code&gt;delete app&lt;/code&gt; button in the AWS console or run &lt;code&gt;amplify delete&lt;/code&gt; from your command line. This will de-provision your backend resources from your AWS account!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Amplify allows you to make your Next.js app fullstack with data, image storage, and authentication without having to have heavy knowledge of the cloud or fullstack development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Busted! Create an ML-Powered Speed Trap</title>
      <author>Rob Lauer</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One relatively positive side effect of living through a global pandemic has been filling the void with family walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, we actually had to interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I started to notice, though, was the reckless driving on some neighborhood streets. With others in similar situations, walking around and crossing busy intersections, I thought it would be cool to stop assuming reckless driving behaviors and start &lt;strong&gt;measuring the frequency of speeding&lt;/strong&gt; along some nearby roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did something about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpvHeAGUA7I"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a portable "speed trap" that uses a machine learning model from &lt;a href="https://www.edgeimpulse.com/"&gt;Edge Impulse&lt;/a&gt; to identify vehicles, a &lt;a href="https://omnipresense.com/product/ops243-doppler-radar-sensor/"&gt;doppler radar sensor&lt;/a&gt; to measure speed, and a &lt;a href="https://blues.io/?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=featured-project&amp;amp;utm_content=speedtrap"&gt;cellular module&lt;/a&gt; to report data to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EcRbDToR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dfff9l6t0umez5c9dddz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EcRbDToR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dfff9l6t0umez5c9dddz.jpg" alt="final speed trap deployment"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Async-Await</title>
      <author>Saurabh Misra</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:39:24 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought Promises couldn't get any better, they just did!😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(drumroll)🥁🥁🥁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asyncawait"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  async/await 🎉
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;async/await are keywords and basically syntactic sugar on top of the Promises API that make promises even more awesome. If promises made async code &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; synchronous, async/await make async code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; synchronous. Let's dive straight in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-async-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; is a keyword that you put in front of a function to make it an &lt;em&gt;async&lt;/em&gt; function. So all of these are examples of async function declaration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomethingElse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomethingMore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An async function is guaranteed to always return a promise. Even if we return a non-promise value from inside it, it will return a fulfilled promise, fulfilled with that value. If an error occurs inside the async function, then the returned promise will be rejected with the error reason.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;throwError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;oh no!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;throwError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "oh no!"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-await-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword is placed in front of a promise object and signals JS to suspend execution of any consecutive statement until the promise is settled. It can only be used inside an async function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above example, when &lt;code&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt; is invoked, JS starts executing the statements inside it synchronously. The first statement executes synchronously meaning a new Promise is created and assigned to the variable &lt;code&gt;promise&lt;/code&gt;. The next statement has an &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword and when JS encouters this keyword, it pauses the execution of &lt;code&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt;. While the execution of &lt;code&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt; is paused, JS works on executing other stuff like updating the DOM or responding to user interactions. After 1 second, when &lt;code&gt;promise&lt;/code&gt; is fulfilled with the value 1, JS again resumes execution of the &lt;code&gt;doSomething()&lt;/code&gt; and assigns the fulfilled value 1 to &lt;code&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/code&gt;. It then executes the &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; and logs this fulfilled value onto the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot use the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword in top-level code or inside a function which is not async. It will lead to an error. It only works inside an async function. For example, if we remove the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; keyword from the above function, it will lead to an error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Uncaught SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and async generators&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-handling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Error handling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens if the promise that is awaited rejects with an error? Well in that case the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword will forward the error.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;oh no!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Uncaught (in promise) oh no!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In order to handle such errors we can wrap our code inside the async function with a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;oh no!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "oh no!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Since the async function returns a promise, we can also attach a &lt;code&gt;catch()&lt;/code&gt; on the returned promise.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;oh no!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doSomething&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "oh no!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;a href="#replace-promises-with-asyncawaitexample-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Replace promises with async/await(Example #1)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the below example from one of the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/saurabhmisra/resolved-promises-and-promise-fates-135d"&gt;previous articles&lt;/a&gt; in this series where we fetched information about a github repo using promises.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetch all repos&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://api.github.com/users/saurabh-misra/repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return the github URL of the 3rd repo in the list&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetch details for this repo&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's re-write this example using async-await.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRepoInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetch repos and parse JSON&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://api.github.com/users/saurabh-misra/repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reposResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetch info on one of the repos&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfoResponse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfoResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRepoInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repoInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see the code is even more readable now. But more than being readable, it's intuitive! It's natural because this is the way we are used to writing and reading code, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because our brains find it easier to read/write synchronous code because the code executes in the same sequence that we read/write it. With asynchronous code, this is a bit of a challenge because some code executes now whereas some other code executes later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, Promises make asynchronous code &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; synchronous since we can interact with the promise object while the asynchronous operation is in progress. And async/await make the code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; synchronous so that it's easier for our brains to read and understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we can understand and reason about the code, the lesser the probability of introducing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#replace-promises-with-asyncawaitexample-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Replace promises with async-await(Example #2)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's consider the case study example involving payment transactions from the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/saurabhmisra/promises-vs-callbacks-1847"&gt;previous section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Again...much better, right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asyncawait-and-paralell-async-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  async/await and Paralell Async Operations
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting scenario is when we want to execute two different async operations in parallel using async/await. Let's see how we can achieve this. I'm going to use a small helper like function called &lt;code&gt;promisifyTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; to basically make &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; return a promise and fulfill it when the timeout occurs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;startParallelTimers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1st timer done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// executes after 1 second&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2nd timer done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// executes after 2 seconds&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;3rd timer done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// executes after 3 seconds&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startParallelTimers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*
1st timer done.
2nd timer done. 
3rd timer done.
*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you run the above example, you'll notice that the logs are printed to the console one after the other each a second apart. The timers represent async operations that are not dependent on each other so they can run paralelly but the way we have placed our &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keywords makes them run sequentially instead i.e the second timer cannot start until the first is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's refactor our code and re-arrange our &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keywords.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;startParallelTimers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thirdTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1st timer done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2nd timer done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thirdTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;3rd timer done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startParallelTimers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*
1st timer done.
2nd timer done. 
3rd timer done.
*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this example, the entire output appears together after 1 second. This is because we started the timers together but awaited them later. There was no need to wait for the previous timer to complete before starting the next timer. This is a good pattern we can use to run parallel async operations using &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; which is to initiate them without using &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; and get the promise objects for each of them and then await the promise objects later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asyncawait-and-the-promise-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  async/await and the Promise API
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; works with any function that returns a promise, it plays well with any of the Promise API methods. Here is an example of how it can work with &lt;code&gt;Promise.all()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;startParallelTimers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thirdTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thirdTimeoutPromise&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startParallelTimers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*
Array(3) [ 1, 2, 3 ]
*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asyncawait-and-thenables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  async/await and Thenables
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember our discussion about thenables from our &lt;a href="https://dev.to/saurabhmisra/resolved-promises-and-promise-fates-135d"&gt;previous sections&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; plays well with thenables also.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thenable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFulfilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onRejected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFulfilled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;testAwaitWithThenable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;thenable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;testAwaitWithThenable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asyncawait-with-class-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  async/await with class methods
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also declare class methods as async and use &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; inside them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fulfilledValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;displayGreetingAfterTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promisifyTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hello👋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;displayGreetingAfterTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hello👋&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#to-summarize"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  To Summarize...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;async/await keywords are syntactic sugar over promises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions defined with the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; keyword always return a Promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword is placed in front of a promise object and can be used to pause the execution of an async function until the promise settles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promises make async code &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; synchronous, &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; make async code &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; synchronous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I always found it difficult to wrap my head around Promises and their usage which is why I decided to study them in detail. This series of articles is a written expression of how I pieced together what I learnt. I hope these articles helped you understand Promises as well and made you feel more comfortable and confident in using them in your projects. Keep on Rocking!🤘&lt;/p&gt;
