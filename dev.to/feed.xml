      <title>How to move up in your org </title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/softchris/a-career-in-devrel-2m75</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you have a career in DevRel? You've done one or more of the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created written content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created video content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoken at meetups or conferences, virtually or in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked with the product teams to advocate for users' feedback and why certain changes are important to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-wonder-whats-next-for-me"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You wonder, what's next for me?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do more of the list above or move up? Here's the thing though, it might not be clear what 'up' looks like. Well, you usually have two choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Management&lt;/strong&gt;. In the management track you are looking at managing functions or teams of people. That's a science all to itself. You should have a genuine interest for people and want to see them grow, to go down this path. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Individual Contributor&lt;/strong&gt;. What if you are happy doing what you do but you still want to advance? At this point, it's all about impact and using your time wisely. You need to realize that your time is a finite resource, and you need to make it count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-i-make-time-count-though"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do I make time count though?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First realize it's about leveraging yourself and what you do in such a way that you have more impact. At this point it's good to ask yourself questions like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what I just did, did it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Improve the product&lt;/strong&gt;. At the end of the day, your company hired you to improve the products they have and increase its usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Did I change the way we work?&lt;/strong&gt;. A very impactful thing to do is realizing that the way you and your colleagues do things is not the most efficient way. can you suggest a better way and can you prove it's better?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Are other folks aware of the work I do?&lt;/strong&gt;. DevRel is a lot about impact, impact on the user communities you work with but it's also about making folks internally, in your company, know what you do. The more people see you as someone that brings about changes and comes with valuable input, the more people will trust you and want to work with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Measure, do it and get good at it&lt;/strong&gt;. You should aim to measure the impact of what you do as much as possible. Is it worth doing if it can't be measured? That last is a bit of hot take but it's to ensure to push you to at least try to measure the activities you do. It's hard to argue with numbers that says you influenced a sale; you drove X more users to a service. What if you can't measure things that exactly? Then you need to be good at storytelling, that can even be the most efficient thing to do at times, but as stated before, numbers are hard to argue with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-i-get-there"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do I get there?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to grow more skills. You might be a great content creator currently but don't know how to strategize or talk to management, also referred to as 'managing up'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of resources out there but learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Write a strategy doc&lt;/strong&gt;. People won't take your word for it. Write it down in a doc, mission, vision, what you want the impact to be and show it to people. Be prepared though that your doc might stay buried in a desk for 2 years, so write many docs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Put yourself in a manager's position&lt;/strong&gt;. The position you are aiming for, try to imagine being them, how would you do their job, responsible for 100+ people, you most likely would need to formulate high-level strategies and care less about a specific tech. A thing you can do is to look at how they communicate via email, try to emulate that style. Look also how they carry out larger meetings, how they set the context, how they drive the meeting, and how they NOT get stuck in petty arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be brave&lt;/strong&gt;. When opportunity knocks, take it, if someone wants you to handle something, go at it with the fury and passion of a thousand stars. Yes, there will be some things that are outside of your comfort zone, but you need to adopt a growth mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Laugh in the face of hardship&lt;/strong&gt;. No really, it's sometimes very hard to navigate being a manager or manage things at a high-level cause it's all about politics. Sometimes you need to circle the problem and listen and just live to fight another day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Get a mentor&lt;/strong&gt;. Someone has done this journey before you. Even though their journey might not be your journey, listen, there's something to be learnt about human behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tell people you want up&lt;/strong&gt;. This might not be obvious to a lot of folks, especially if you like me come from a culture where you shouldn't make too many waves, let the work speak for you etc. The moment you say you want 'up', people look at you differently cause &lt;em&gt;moving up&lt;/em&gt; is to commit yourself to the company in a whole new way. It's not just about you anymore, what you do, but realize you are unimportant, it's about the mission of the company. - Align yourself to the mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is helpful and it will make you realize that promotions don't just happen by hard work, it's a mental shift, it's a promotional campaign and it's a ton of work. But for the right company for the right mission, it will be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging with Dashbird: AWS Lambda Process Exited Before Completing Request</title>
      <author>Taavi Rehemägi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:51:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dashbird/debugging-with-dashbird-aws-lambda-process-exited-before-completing-request-575l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dashbird/debugging-with-dashbird-aws-lambda-process-exited-before-completing-request-575l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another generic error message&lt;/strong&gt; from our favorite FaaS provider AWS Lambda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, there are multiple reasons why this issue could arise. Let's first look at the &lt;a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/"&gt;basics of AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; to get a better intuition for when things go wrong later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-lambda-is-asynchronous"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Lambda is Asynchronous
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lambda is an &lt;strong&gt;asynchronous event-based service&lt;/strong&gt; at heart. The Lambda service asynchronously calls your functions---this doesn't mean that all events are handled asynchronously, but &lt;strong&gt;relates mainly to the programming model&lt;/strong&gt; you have to use inside your function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This shouldn't be confused with the event handling&lt;/strong&gt; of Lambda, which can be synchronous and asynchronous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In synchronous event handling&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, when your function handles an &lt;a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/api-gateway/what-is-aws-api-gateway/"&gt;API Gateway&lt;/a&gt; event, the event provider waits until you handled the event so that it can supply its own client with your results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A browser sends a request to API Gateway, and API Gateway, in turn, sends the request as an event to a Lambda function. The browser will now wait for a response, and API Gateway will wait to handle the event. The longer your function takes, the longer both the browser and API Gateway will wait. &lt;strong&gt;Until a maximum of 30 seconds, API Gateway will call it a day and tell the browser your function timed out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In asynchronous event handling&lt;/strong&gt;, the event provider will just give the event to Lambda and call it a day. &lt;strong&gt;It will not wait for an answer&lt;/strong&gt; from your Lambda function, whether it takes three seconds or ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/what-are-aws-lambda-triggers/"&gt;trigger a Lambda function&lt;/a&gt; from an S3 upload, the S3 service will never notice if the Lambda function failed or succeeded in handling the event. It will just trigger the function and then march on to other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asynchronous-event-handling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Asynchronous Event Handling
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside your Lambda function, you have to write asynchronous code. &lt;strong&gt;You can't simply take some arguments and return your calculations directly&lt;/strong&gt;, like in the following example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports.handler = (event, context) =&amp;gt;  {&lt;br&gt;
const result = event.data.x  * event.data.x;&lt;br&gt;
return  { statusCode: 200, body: result };&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to use some asynchronous computing constructs&lt;/strong&gt; to handle the results. In the currently supported versions of the Node.js runtime for AWS Lambda, you have to use promises or asynchronous functions to handle your return values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A promise version would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports.handler =(event, context) =&amp;gt;  new  Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt;  {&lt;br&gt;
const result = event.data.x  * event.data.x;&lt;br&gt;
resolve({ statusCode: 200, body: result });&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your handler function would directly return a new promise object that would be resolved in the future. You would call resolve if all went well or reject if you encountered an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the corresponding asynchronous function looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports.handler = async  (event, context) =&amp;gt;  {&lt;br&gt;
const result = event.data.x  * event.data.x;&lt;br&gt;
return  { statusCode: 200, body: result };&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An asynchronous function is a regular function marked with async at the beginning. This keyword wraps the whole function in a promise, so you don't have to do it manually. If you return, the promise will be resolved. If you throw an error, the promise will be rejected. This way, &lt;strong&gt;you can write code that looks synchronous but behaves asynchronously&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using an asynchronous function is a "de facto" standard of writing Lambda handlers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-legacy-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Legacy Way
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Node.js version 11 was still supported, you had to use the context or a callback for your returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context version looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports.handler = (event, context) =&amp;gt;  {&lt;br&gt;
const result = event.data.x  * event.data.x;&lt;br&gt;
context.done(null, { statusCode: 200, body: result });&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the first argument to context.done is an error object; if none exist, we can use null.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The callback version looked like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&amp;gt;  {&lt;br&gt;
const result = event.data.x  * event.data.x;&lt;br&gt;
callback({ statusCode: 200, body: result });&lt;br&gt;
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the asynchronous event handling got streamlined within &lt;a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/aws-lambda-nodejs-10-vs-14/"&gt;new Node.js versions&lt;/a&gt;, so you only have to return from an asynchronous function, and Node.js will take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-completing-a-request-mean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Does Completing a Request Mean?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a basic understanding of how AWS Lambda works let's look at our error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AWS Lambda process exited before completing request&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code examples, we saw how it looks when we complete a request, so you might know what will cause the error to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the legacy code that uses &lt;code&gt;context.done&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;callback&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; this error will happen when your code doesn't reach one of these calls&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current versions that use promises or asynchronous functions, &lt;strong&gt;this error will happen if the promise didn't resolve or the function didn't return&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, your function code did all of its work but never reached one of these four end states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An asynchronous function implicitly returns if no code is left to work on, so even if you don't write a return statement, it will still "complete" just without any returned values. The other three versions of completing require you to call something explicitly, be it &lt;code&gt;context.done&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;callback&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;resolve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-leads-to-this-error"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Leads to This Error?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This error is mostly related to legacy behavior&lt;/strong&gt;. These days other errors trigger instead of this one. So, this error is mostly a "catch what's left" kind of error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons why you didn't call the explicit return functions before your function exited, but &lt;strong&gt;most of them will lead to a timeout or exceeding memory limit&lt;/strong&gt; kind of error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chances of you writing code that falls in a niche not covered by other errors are quite good. This can happen if you call upstream services, like DynamoDB, for example, and they fail silently for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-solve-this-error"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Solve This Error?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a standalone Lambda function doesn't make much sense---usually, you use one to connect other services with some transformation and business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your best course of action here is to look into the &lt;a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/exploring-lambda-limitations/"&gt;limits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of these services and all the places where you call them with the AWS SDK. If you sent too much data at once or forgot some attributes in the SDK call, things can fail without any explicit error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the asynchronous function style to signal that your function has completed, you can't forget to call the right functions at the end anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Incremental Versioned Datasets in Kedro</title>
      <author>Waylon Walker</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:50:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/incremental-versioned-datasets-in-kedro-3ajn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/incremental-versioned-datasets-in-kedro-3ajn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kedro versioned datasets can be mixed with incremental and partitioned datasets to do some timeseries analysis on how our dataset changes over time.  Kedro is a very extensible and composible framework, that allows us to build solutions&lt;br&gt;
from the individual components that it provides.  This article is a great example of how you can combine these components in unique ways to achieve some powerful results with very little work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-our-dataset-change-over-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does our dataset change over time??
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a question presented to me at work.  We had some plots being produces as the output of our pipeline and the user wanted the ability to compare results over time.  Luckily this was asked early in the project so we were able&lt;br&gt;
to proactively setup versioning on the right datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable this all we needed to do now was to add &lt;code&gt;versioned: true&lt;/code&gt; and we will be able to compare results over time.  Yes kedro makes it that easy to setup.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;

    &lt;div class="ltag__link__pic"&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Ukb2PhF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Izxe95PY--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/271838/95e313ca-39fc-4ee6-bf57-ad52b4dcf0d2.png" alt="waylonwalker"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/waylonwalker/what-is-kedro-lob" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;🤷‍♀️ What is Kedro (The Parts)&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Waylon Walker ・ Feb 24 '20 ・ 3 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#dataengineering&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#kedro&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#datascience&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-a-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  set up a project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up a new project just as usual.  &lt;strong&gt;note&lt;/strong&gt; I like using pipx for global cli packages.  You can pick a specific version of kedro or opt for the latest while simply globally installing kedro and running kedro new is purely dependent on the last time you chose to update kedro.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;pipx
pipx run kedro new

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;versioned-partitioned-kedro-example
conda create &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; versioned-partitioned-kedro-example &lt;span class="nv"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;3.8  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
conda activate versioned-partitioned-kedro-example

pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;kedro
kedro &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install

&lt;/span&gt;git init
git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"init project from pipx run kedro new"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I called my project versioned-partitioned-kedro-example. You can call your project whatever you like.  If you try to use some special characters where they don't belong, kedro will catch you.  Under the hood, kedro is using a&lt;br&gt;
library called &lt;code&gt;cookiecutter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Please do not skip out on using a virtual environment. You may use whichever virtual environment tool you prefer, but please do not skip out. Wrecking a running project for learning is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  update dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I popped open my dependencies, added &lt;code&gt;kedro[pandas]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find-kedro&lt;/code&gt;. Since those are extra packages our example will require.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aiohttp
black==21.5b1
find-kedro
flake8&amp;gt;=3.7.9, &amp;lt;4.0
ipython
isort~=5.0
jupyter_client&amp;gt;=5.1, &amp;lt;7.0
jupyterlab~=3.0
jupyter~=1.0
kedro-telemetry~=0.1.0
kedro==0.17.4
kedro[pandas]
nbstripout~=0.4
pytest-cov~=2.5
pytest-mock&amp;gt;=1.7.1, &amp;lt;2.0
pytest~=6.2
requests
wheel&amp;gt;=0.35, &amp;lt;0.37
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note&lt;/strong&gt; I created &lt;code&gt;find-kedro&lt;/code&gt;, and I like using it to create my pipeline object.  Think of how pytest automatically picks up everything named &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find-kedro&lt;/code&gt; does the same thing for kedro.  It picks up everything with &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pipeline&lt;/code&gt; in the name and creates pipelines out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-new-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install new dependencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding our additional dependencies to the &lt;code&gt;requirements.in&lt;/code&gt;, we can tell kedro to install everything and compile the dependencies.  Behind the scenes &lt;code&gt;--build-reqs&lt;/code&gt; uses a library called &lt;code&gt;pip-compile&lt;/code&gt; to create a &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file with hard pinned dependencies, which is ideal for creating reproducible projects.  You and your future colleagues may not thank you for this, but they sure as heck won't be cursing your name when they can't&lt;br&gt;
get the project to run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kedro &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--build-reqs&lt;/span&gt;

git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"added additional dependencies"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-node"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  create a node
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we need a node to do much.  This node will&lt;br&gt;
pass the &lt;code&gt;cars.csv&lt;/code&gt; from a URL to a &lt;code&gt;parquet&lt;/code&gt; file.  I am going to use a lambda to build my identity function inline.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pipelines/cars_nodes.py
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;kedro.pipeline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'raw_cars'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'create_int_cars'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗒️ &lt;strong&gt;note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;find-kedro' will automatically pick up these nodes for us after we set up our&lt;/code&gt;pipeline_registry.py`.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash&lt;br&gt;
git add .&lt;br&gt;
git commit -m "add create_int_cars node"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implement-findkedro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  implement find-kedro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to tell kedro where our nodes are.  This is where &lt;code&gt;find-kedro&lt;/code&gt; comes in.  Once we point to the directory where our modules of nodes/pipelines are, it creates the pipelines dictionary for us automatically.  It will even separate each module into a pipeline and stitch them all into one default pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;` python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pipelineregistrypy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  pipeline_registry.py
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"""Project pipelines."""&lt;br&gt;
from typing import Dict&lt;br&gt;
from pathlib import Path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from kedro.pipeline import Pipeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from find_kedro import find_kedro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def register_pipelines() -&amp;gt; Dict[str, Pipeline]:&lt;br&gt;
    """Register the project's pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Returns:
    A mapping from a pipeline name to a "Pipeline "object.
"""
pipeline_dir = Path(__file__).parent / 'pipelines'
return find_kedro(directory= pipeline_dir)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗒️ This is very similar to the default ` pipeline_registry'except the last two&lt;br&gt;
lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"implement find-kedro"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-baseline-catalog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  create a baseline catalog
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have a pipeline setup, the kedro cli can automatically fill in missing catalog entries with  &lt;code&gt;MemoryDataSet&lt;/code&gt;'s. Thus, using the cli helps consistently scaffold the catalog and ensure we don't end up with a typo in our dataset name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kedro catalog create &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--pipeline&lt;/span&gt; cars_nodes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kedro will kick out the following catalog file to &lt;code&gt;base/catalog/cars_nodes.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
for us to get started with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;raw_cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;MemoryDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;MemoryDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔥 use the kedro cli to fill in any missing datasets from the automatically catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#make-a-versioned-dataset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  make a versioned dataset
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kedro has scaffolded &lt;code&gt;MemoryDataSet&lt;/code&gt; 's for us.  We will convert them to the appropriate dataset type and turn on versioning for our &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; layer, which is the first point we save in our environment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;raw_cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pandas.CSVDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;filepath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;https://waylonwalker.com/cars.csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pandas.ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;filepath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;data/int_cars.parquet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;versioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Commit your changes to the catalog.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"create catalog"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-the-pipeline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  run the pipeline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have the nodes and catalog setup, we can run the pipeline a few times to get some versioned data.  Each time we run, it will save a new version inside the &lt;code&gt;int_cars.parquet&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kedro run
kedro run
kedro run
kedro run
kedro run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗒️ we put our data in the data directory. By default, this directory is included in the &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; and will not be picked up by git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inspect-the-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  inspect the data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing the files in &lt;code&gt;data/int_cars.parquet&lt;/code&gt; shows that I now have five different datasets available.  I can load old ones, but by default, kedro will load the latest one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ls &lt;/span&gt;data/int_cars.parquet

2021-07-05T15.24.53.164Z
2021-07-05T15.29.56.144Z
2021-07-05T15.30.23.101Z
2021-07-05T15.30.26.555Z
2021-07-05T15.31.12.688Z
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗒️ kedro sets the version at the timestamp that the session starts.  All datasets created within the same run will have the same version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stack-on-an-incremental-dataset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  stack on an incremental dataset
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get interesting. Kedro comes with an incremental dataset that will load all of the files from a particular directory into a dictionary where the keys are the filename of the dataset.  To load up all datasets into&lt;br&gt;
this dictionary all we need to do is add a new catalog entry that is a  &lt;code&gt;type: PartitionedDataSet&lt;/code&gt;, with a &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; pointing to the same place as the original, and a &lt;code&gt;dataset&lt;/code&gt; type the same as the original.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars_partitioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pandas.ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;data/int_cars.parquet&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#catalog-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  catalog list
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing the catalog entries confirms that we have successfully added our new &lt;code&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;catalog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'raw_cars'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_partitioned'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;'parameters'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loading-an-incremental-dataset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  loading an incremental dataset
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can easily load the datasets from every run we just did into a single dictionary, simply by running &lt;code&gt;context.catalog.load('int_cars_incremental')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;catalog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_incremental'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;05&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;534&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_catalog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`int_cars_incremental`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IncrementalDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2021-07-05T15.29.56.144Z/int_cars.parquet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="n"&gt;Unnamed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;mpg&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;cyl&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;disp&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;hp&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;drat&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="n"&gt;wt&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;qsec&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;vs&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;gear&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;carb&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;Mazda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RX4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Wag&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;21.0&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;160.0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;110&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.90&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.875&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;17.02&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dino&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;19.7&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;145.0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;175&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.62&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.770&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;15.50&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Maserati&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Bora&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;15.0&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;301.0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;335&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.54&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.570&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;14.60&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="mi"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="n"&gt;Volvo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;142&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;21.4&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;121.0&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mi"&gt;109&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.11&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.780&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;18.60&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👆 notice that incremental datasets are all loaded for you, its a dict of &lt;code&gt;filepath:dataset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stack-on-a-partitioned-dataset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  stack on a partitioned dataset
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at a similar type of dataset called &lt;code&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/code&gt;.  We can add it to the catalog in a very similar way to how we added the &lt;code&gt;IncrementalDataSet&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars_incremental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;IncrementalDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pandas.ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;data/int_cars.parquet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loading-a-partitioned-dataset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  loading a partitioned dataset
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we get a dict with the same keys as before, but this time the values are a load function rather than loaded data.  Partitioned datasets can be helpful if you are operating on datasets that take up more memory than you have available. In our case of coupling this with versioned datasets, its likely to grow quite large, so &lt;code&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/code&gt; 's are likely a better option for this use.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;catalog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_partitioned'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;05&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;253&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_catalog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`int_cars_partitioned`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2021-07-05T15.29.56.144Z/int_cars.parquet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractVersionedDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parquet_dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x7f4bb1570820&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;'2021-07-05T15.30.23.101Z/int_cars.parquet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractVersionedDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parquet_dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x7f4bb1570850&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;'2021-07-05T15.30.26.555Z/int_cars.parquet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractVersionedDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parquet_dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x7f4bb1570910&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;'2021-07-05T15.31.12.688Z/int_cars.parquet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AbstractVersionedDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;extras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parquet_dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ParquetDataSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x7f4bb15709a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#incremental-vs-partitioned"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  incremental vs. partitioned
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;IncrementalDataSet&lt;/code&gt; 's and &lt;code&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/code&gt; 's are very similar as they give you access to a whole directory of data that uses the same underlying dataset loader.  The significant difference is whether you want your data pre-loaded or if you want to load and dispose of it as you iterate over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incremental loads the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;partitioned give a load function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-nodes-with-partitioned-datasets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  creating nodes with partitioned datasets
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a node with this &lt;code&gt;PartitionedDataSet&lt;/code&gt; to collect stats on our dataset over time.  This node does a dict comprehension to get the length of each version that we pulled.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;timeseries_partitioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timeseries_partitioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_partitioned'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_timeseries_partitioned'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'create_int_cars_timeseries_partitioned'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🗒️ note that inside of the dict comprehension car is a load function that we need to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-nodes-with-incremental-datasets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  creating nodes with incremental datasets
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing the same node with our &lt;code&gt;IncrementalDataSet&lt;/code&gt; looks very similar, except this time car is loaded data inside of the dict comprehension, not a function that we need to call.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;timeseries_incremental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timeseries_incremental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_incremental'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_timeseries_incremental'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'create_int_cars_timeseries_incremental'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-catalog-entries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More catalog entries
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding those nodes, we can add the catalog entries again with the command line.  This will not overwrite any of the datasets we just created. It will only add to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kedro catalog create &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--pipeline&lt;/span&gt; cars_nodes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars_timeseries_partitioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;MemoryDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars_timeseries_incremental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;MemoryDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars_timeseries_partitioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pickle.PickleDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;filepath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;data/int_cars_timeseries_partitioned.parquet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;int_cars_timeseries_incremental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pickle.PickleDataSet&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;filepath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;data/int_cars_timeseries_incremental.parquet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loading-the-new-datasets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loading the new datasets
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading the two dtasets that we just created show that we have the ended up with the same result using both incremental and partitioned datasets.  This result is a dictionary of filepaths mapped to the size of the dataset.  Since the default filepaths are timestamps we could start doing some time series analysis to see how our dataset is changing over time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;catalog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'int_cars_timeseries_incremental'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;05&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;014&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_catalog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`int_cars_timeseries_incremental`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PickleDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2021-07-05T15.29.56.144Z/int_cars.parquet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;05&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;223&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kedro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_catalog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Loading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`int_cars_timeseries_partitioned`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PickleDataSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)...&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A variable is a value that can change in your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-variable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a variable
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure to create a variable consists of:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Type
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tells the program what type of variable it is, these can be &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#name"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Name
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique name to identify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Value
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some examples
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;decimal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5.67&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;7.90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;d2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1.23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"string"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sc"&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that a string is defined by using doble quotes &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;, while a char is defined by using single quotes &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#array-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Array variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also create a variable type that is the &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; type, these variables are a list of values of a certain type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an array is created, you can update its values, re-assign, but not extend its size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating an array
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arrays are defined by adding &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; after the data type, and can be assigned using one of the two forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#form-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Form 1
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;value1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;valiue2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this example, you create an array, that has a length of 3.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;int[] arrayOfIntegers = new []{ 1, 2, 3 };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this form, you don't need to specify the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#form-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Form 2
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this example, you create an array, that has a length of 4.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;int[] arrayOfIntegers = new int[4];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When creating an array in this form, the array will have 4 entries and all set to its default value, which in this case is 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#assigning-values"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Assigning values
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can assign values to an array by using its index, which starts at 0 and ends with its length - 1;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arrayOfIntegers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;arrayOfIntegers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;arrayOfIntegers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;arrayOfIntegers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#constants"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Constants
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create variables that cannot change after being initialized. These types of variables are called constants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;constantIntegerValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Running Jaeger Locally: How to Get Started</title>
      <author>Amir Blum</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:33:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aspecto/running-jaeger-locally-how-to-get-started-51g3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aspecto/running-jaeger-locally-how-to-get-started-51g3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, you’ll learn how to run Jaeger locally, why and when you should do it, as well as what are Jaeger’s limitations when running locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: a distributed tracing system is generally composed of client and backend components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will touch briefly on client components, though most of this post is about backend components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#client-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Client Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client part is usually a set of libraries installed inside an application which “instrument” it — generating a “span” object for each interesting event happening in runtime inside the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern and recommended open-source client SDK that does that is &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io/"&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spans on the client alone are meaningless — they need to be accessible to a person who consumes them. Consumers are usually dev-ops teams monitoring a system or developers maintaining the system and adding new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trace-usages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trace Usages
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which collected trace data can be used and provide value. These are the common ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregate spans to trace — group all spans (events) which are part of the same trace (logical operation) arriving from different distributed services, into a single entity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query the collected data (show me all traces in the last hour starting at endpoint &lt;code&gt;GET /users&lt;/code&gt; in service X)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualize the data — usually in a graph, or timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find errors (exceptions, 500s, etc) and investigate their root-cause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate performance bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Backend Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fulfill the requirements above, we need to set up backend components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are used to collect spans from client components, process them, store them in a database, expose an API for the data and UI to view traces and perform queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/"&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; graduated project) is a popular open-source project with backend components that does that and is easy to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Jaeger in production, it is recommended to install it in a cloud environment with load-balancing, auto-scaling, replications, and all that jazz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is sometimes enough to just run it locally in a lightweight and simple setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running Locally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.23/getting-started/"&gt;The recommended&lt;/a&gt; approach for running Jaeger backend locally is to use docker:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.23
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And access the UI in &lt;a href="http://localhost:16686"&gt;http://localhost:16686&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then configure an Opentelemetry Client SDK installation or &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector"&gt;OpenTelemetry Collector&lt;/a&gt; to use Jaeger exporter and send trace data to this local Jaeger.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { NodeTracerProvider } from "@opentelemetry/node";
import { SimpleSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/tracing";
import { JaegerExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger";

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider();
provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(new JaegerExporter()));
provider.register();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is how exporting data to local jaeger looks like in nodejs).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-local-jaeger-benefits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running Local Jaeger: Benefits
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-faster-debugging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Faster Debugging
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work on a service codebase (e.g., fixing a bug, developing a new feature, or implementing integration to other services/databases/messaging systems, etc.), most likely that this is what you do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You start an instance of the service on your local dev station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send traffic to it to test your changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate the behavior you were expecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By instrumenting it locally, you can debug development issues faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: find the point in your app where an error occurred with less logging to console, breakpoints, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CIvEULSG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7mbq1ax2y0mfkt887g2t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CIvEULSG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7mbq1ax2y0mfkt887g2t.png" alt="An example of a trace in Jaeger showing error while accessing Redis key as a list"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;An example of a trace in Jaeger showing error while accessing Redis key as a list (the red underlines are not part of the Jaeger UI)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-running-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Running Tests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running your integration test suite locally — if a test fails, it can sometimes be easier to understand what went wrong by examining it in Jaeger UI, where you can view highlighted errors and events organized into a hierarchical structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-instrumentation-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Instrumentation Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are writing a new instrumentation library, observing the tracing output in a UI can be much easier than browsing through textual logs. You can browse the &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry-instrumentation"&gt;JS instrumentation package&lt;/a&gt; for more info and examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-local-jager-limitations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running Local Jager: Limitations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaeger is free, relatively easy to set up, and will do a good job for most basic setups and tracing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UI and features set are quite basic and you may quickly find yourself in the need of &lt;a href="https://www.aspecto.io/compare-jaeger-aspecto/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally"&gt;more advanced features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aspecto.io/compare-jaeger-aspecto/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally"&gt;Other alternatives&lt;/a&gt; can give value and increase development productivity in the following cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-lack-of-end-to-end-visibility-in-async-messaging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Lack of End to End Visibility in Async Messaging
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using async messaging systems, generally, there are two cases for traces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is when the message broker generates one trace. Jaeger does a great job of displaying us with that one trace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second case, common in batch processing scenarios, is when the senders and receivers in message brokers like Kafka and AWS SQS generate multiple traces (for example, each receive starts a new trace). In this case, Jaeger will display these traces separately. That makes it more complicated to track and debug complex transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More advanced backends might have an out-of-the-box solution for that and will &lt;a href="https://www.aspecto.io/product/production-troubleshooting/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally"&gt;detect it and merge those traces into a single logical flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-cross-environment-traces"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Cross Environment Traces
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization works with Jaeger in production, and let’s say you want to use Jaeger to do your tests, sending your local traces to the production Jaeger is highly suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only can it pollute the production environment, but it makes it difficult to find your traces within this trace jungle. By running Jaeger locally, you get an isolated playground for your tests and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one major pitfall in this scenario is that your local Jaeger will show only the part of the trace generated from your local dev station. It means you lose the context of how your traces communicate and affect downstream and upstream services (i.e., production and staging).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;em&gt;you won’t have an isolated and local development session while seeing the full effect of your changes&lt;/em&gt; across the different environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-advanced-search"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Advanced Search
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free text search on all data or based on trace attributes. For example, if you want to search a token in the payload within specific traces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-trace-data-processing-and-insights"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Trace Data Processing and Insights
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaeger presents raw traces and highlights errors, however, generating insights based only on that data isn’t trivial and quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples for such insights can be API breaking change detection, aggregation of traces based on structure, parameter journey in a trace, dependency analysis, comparison to baseline from production or staging, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-enhanced-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Enhanced UI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaeger UI enumerates all attributes for a span in a long list. It does not group or organizes related data, show JSON content in a tree, highlight common data like HTTP status code, and other good stuff that makes our life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-bottom-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Bottom Line
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running local Jaeger offers great benefits. It is easy to set up, and when it comes to faster debug and running tests, you get this extra confidence you might want when working locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaeger is a great tool and does an awesome job answering your basic tracing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, when your work with services gets a bit more complex, or when you want to take your productivity to the next level when working locally, you might want to &lt;a href="https://www.aspecto.io/compare-jaeger-aspecto/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally"&gt;consider other alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the limitations I mentioned above are a deal-breaker for you (if not now, they might be in the future), there are several vendors in the market, supplying various solutions which enhance your tracing-based workflow. One that can help you overcome all these issues is Aspecto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aspecto.io/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally"&gt;Aspecto&lt;/a&gt; gives you everything you get with Jaeger but with enhanced UI, search, and troubleshooting capabilities for &lt;a href="https://www.aspecto.io/product/local-debugging/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally"&gt;local development and debugging&lt;/a&gt;. It takes 2 minutes to &lt;a href="(https://www.aspecto.io/?utm_source=dev.to&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=why-and-how-to-run-jaeger-locally)"&gt;get started&lt;/a&gt; with, it’s free and OpenTelemetry-based. Think of it as Jaeger and Chrome DevTools fusion for your distributed applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Typeclasses in Python</title>
      <author>Nikita Sobolev</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:17:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/wemake-services/typeclasses-in-python-3ma6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/wemake-services/typeclasses-in-python-3ma6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Originally published in my blog&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://sobolevn.me/2021/06/typeclasses-in-python"&gt;https://sobolevn.me/2021/06/typeclasses-in-python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to introduce a new concept for Python developers: typeclasses.&lt;br&gt;
It is a concept behind our new &lt;code&gt;dry-python&lt;/code&gt; library called &lt;a href="https://github.com/dry-python/classes/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will tell you in advance, that it will look very familiar to what you already know and possibly even use. Moreover, we reuse a lot of existing code from Python's standard library. So, you can call this approach "native" and "pythonic". And it is still going to be interesting: I am showing examples in 4 different languages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, before discussing typeclasses themselves, let's discuss what problem they do solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-functions-must-behave-differently"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some functions must behave differently
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this one is a familiar problem to all of the devs out there.&lt;br&gt;
How can we write a function that will behave differently for different types?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create an example. We want to &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; different types differently (yes, "hello world" examples, here we go).&lt;br&gt;
We want to &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; instances as &lt;code&gt;Hello, {string_content}!&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;MyUser&lt;/code&gt; instances as &lt;code&gt;Hello again, {username}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, that &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; as a simple example does not really make much "business" sense, but more complicated things like &lt;code&gt;to_json&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;from_json&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;to_sql&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;from_sql&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;to_binary&lt;/code&gt; do make a lot of sense and can be found in almost any project.&lt;br&gt;
But, for the sake of implementation simplicity, I'm going to stick to our &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first approach that comes to our minds is to use &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; checks inside the function itself.&lt;br&gt;
And it can work in some cases! The only requirement is that we &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; know all the types we will work with in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how it would look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello, "{0}"!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isinstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello again, {0}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Cannot greet "{0}" type'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main limitation is that we cannot extend this function for other type easily (we can use wrapper function, but I consiser this a redefinition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in some cases - &lt;code&gt;isinstance&lt;/code&gt; won't be enough, because we need extendability. We need to support other types, which are unknown in advance.&lt;br&gt;
Our users might need to &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; their custom types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's the part where things begin to get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All programming languages address this problem differently.&lt;br&gt;
Let's start with Python's traditional OOP approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#oop-extendability-and-overabstraction-problems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OOP extendability and over-abstraction problems
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does Python solve this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that Python has magic methods for some builtin functions like &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__len__&lt;/code&gt;, it solves exactly the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to greet a user:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello again, {0}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can use this method directly or you can create a helper with &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;typing.Protocol&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;typing_extensions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Protocol&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CanGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""
        It will match any object that has the ``greet`` method.

        Mypy will also check that ``greet`` must return ``str``.
        """&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CanGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we can use it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'example'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello again, example
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, it works? &lt;em&gt;Not really&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, some classes do not want to know some details about themselves to maintain abstraction integrity.&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;become_friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;friend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Person'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_friend_of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Person'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get_pets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Pet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does this &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; (pun intended) deserve to know that some &lt;code&gt;to_json&lt;/code&gt; conversion exists that can turn this poor &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; into textual data? What about binary pickling?&lt;br&gt;
Of course not, these details should not be added to a business-level abstraction, this is called a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction"&gt;leaky abstraction&lt;/a&gt; when you do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I think that mixing structure and behavior into a single abstraction is bad. Why? Because you cannot tell in advance what behavior you would need from a given structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For abstractions on this level, it is way easier to have behavior near the structure, not inside it. Mixing these two only makes sense when we work on a higher level like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform"&gt;processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, it only works for custom types. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem"&gt;Existing types are hard to extend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
For example, how would you add the &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; method to the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; type?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; subtype with &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; method in it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyStr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello, {0}!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, this would require a change in our usage:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello, world!
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# fails with TypeError
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#monkeypatching"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Monkey-patching
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might suggest that we can just insert the needed methods directly into an object / type.&lt;br&gt;
Some dynamically typed languages went on this path: &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; (in 2000s and early 2010s, mostly popularized by &lt;code&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt; plugins) and &lt;code&gt;Ruby&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html"&gt;still happening right now&lt;/a&gt;). Here's how it looks:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvious, that it is not going to work for anything complex. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch#Pitfalls"&gt;Why&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different parts of your program might use monkey-patching of methods with the same name, but with different functionality. And nothing will work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is hard to read because the original source does not contain the patched method and the patching location might be hidden deeply in other files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is hard to type, for example, &lt;code&gt;mypy&lt;/code&gt; does not support it at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python community is not used to this style, it would be rather hard to persuade them to write their code like this (and that's a good thing!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that it is clear: we won't fall into this trap. Let's consider another alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extra-abstractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extra abstractions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People familiar with things like &lt;code&gt;django-rest-framework&lt;/code&gt; might recommend to add &lt;a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/"&gt;special abstractions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; different types:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;typing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Generic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TypeVar&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;_Wrapped&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TypeVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'_Wrapped'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;BaseGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Generic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_Wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""Abstract class of all other """&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_Wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_wrapped&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wrapped&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;abstractmethod&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;StrGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BaseGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""Wrapped instance of built-in type ``str``."""&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello, {0}!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Our custom type:
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyUserGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BaseGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello again, {0}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we can use it like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyStrGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello, world!
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUserGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'example'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello again, example
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, now we have a different problem: we have a gap between real types and their wrappers. There's no easy way to wrap a type into its wrapper. How can we match them? We have to do it either by hand or use some kind of registry like &lt;code&gt;Dict[type, Type[BaseGreet]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is still not enough, there will be runtime errors! In practice, it ends up like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;X&amp;gt; is not json-serializable&lt;/code&gt; as many of us might have seen it with &lt;code&gt;drf&lt;/code&gt;'s serializers when trying to serialize a custom unregistered type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#typeclasses-and-similar-concepts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Typeclasses and similar concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at how functional languages (and &lt;code&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt;, people still &lt;a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/10/is-rust-functional/"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; whether it is functional or not) handle this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some common knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All these languages don't have &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; concept as we know it in Python and, of course, there's no subclassing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the languages below don't have &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;s as we do in Python, they don't mix behavior and structure (however, &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt; has Alan Kay's &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-Alan-Kay-think-about-Joe-Armstrong-claiming-that-Erlang-might-be-the-only-object-oriented-language-and-also-his-thesis-supervisor-s-claim-that-Erlang-is-extremely-object-oriented"&gt;real objects&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, these languages use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism"&gt;ad-hoc polymorphism&lt;/a&gt; to make functions behave differently for different types via overloading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, you don't have to know any of the languages below to understand what is going on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#elixir"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Elixir
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with one of my favorites.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/protocols.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Protocol&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; to achieve what we want:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Our custom protocol"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;defprotocol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This is an abstract function,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# that will behave differently for each type.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Enhancing built-in type"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;defimpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;for:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;BitString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Custom data type"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;defmodule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;defstruct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Enhancing our own type"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;defimpl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;for:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello again, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that my readers were able to read and understand &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt; even if they are not familiar with this language. That's what I call beauty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage of the code above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Using our `Greet.greet` function with both our data types:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"world"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello, world!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"example"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello again, example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The thing with &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;Protocol&lt;/code&gt;s is that it is &lt;a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/7541"&gt;not currently possible&lt;/a&gt; to express that some type does support our &lt;code&gt;Greet.greet&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir"&gt;type checker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
But, this is not a big deal for &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt;, which is 100% dynamically typed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protocols are very widely used, they power lots of the language's features.&lt;br&gt;
Here are some real-life examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.11.0/Enumerable.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumerable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; allows to work with collections: counting elements, finding members, reducing, and slicing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.11.0/String.Chars.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;String.Chars&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is something like &lt;code&gt;__str__&lt;/code&gt; in Python, it converts structures to human-readable format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rust"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rust
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trait&lt;/code&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is pretty similar to &lt;code&gt;Protocol&lt;/code&gt;s in &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Our custom trait&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;trait&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Enhancing built-in type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;format!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, {}!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Defining our own type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Enhancing it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;format!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello again, {}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;.name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And of course, due to &lt;code&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt;'s static typing, we can express that some function's argument supports the trait we have just defined:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight rust"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// We can express that `greet` function only accepts types&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;// that implement `Greet` trait:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dyn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// Using our `greet` function with both our data types:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"world"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.to_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// Hello, world!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"{}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"example"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.to_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c"&gt;// Hello again, example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See? The idea is so similar, that it uses almost the same syntax as &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable real-life examples of how &lt;code&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt; uses its &lt;code&gt;Trait&lt;/code&gt;s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Clone&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - duplicating objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to show better &lt;code&gt;repr&lt;/code&gt; of an object, again like &lt;code&gt;__str__&lt;/code&gt; in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;code&gt;Trait&lt;/code&gt;s are the core of this language, it is widely used in cases when you need to define any shared behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#haskell"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Haskell
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Haskell&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses"&gt;typeclasses&lt;/a&gt; to do almost the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what's a typeclass?&lt;br&gt;
Typeclass is a group of types, all of which satisfy some common contract.&lt;br&gt;
It is also a form of ad-hoc polymorphism that is mostly used for overloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit sorry for the &lt;code&gt;Haskell&lt;/code&gt; syntax below, it might be not very pleasant and clear to read, especially for people who are not familiar with this brilliant language, but we have what we have:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight haskell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Our custom typeclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Enhancing built-in type with it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, "&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"!"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Defining our own type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Enhancing it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello again, "&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, we do the same thing as we have already done for &lt;code&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We define a &lt;code&gt;Greet&lt;/code&gt; typeclass that has a single function to implement: &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we define instance implementation for &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type, which is a built-in (alias for &lt;code&gt;[Char]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we define custom &lt;code&gt;MyUser&lt;/code&gt; type with &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing the &lt;code&gt;Greet&lt;/code&gt; typeclass for &lt;code&gt;MyUser&lt;/code&gt; is the last thing we do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can use our new &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight haskell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Here you can see that we can use `Greet` typeclass to annotate our types.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- I have made this alias entirely for this annotation demo,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- in real life we would just use `greet` directly:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;greetAlias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;greetAlias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;greetAlias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"world"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Hello, world!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;greetAlias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"example"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;-- Hello again, example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some real-life examples of typeclasses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.15.0.0/docs/Text-Show.html#t:Show"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Show&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to convert things into user-readable representations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Applicate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are all typeclasses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that among our three examples, &lt;code&gt;Haskell&lt;/code&gt; relies on its typeclasses the heaviest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that typeclasses from &lt;code&gt;Haskell&lt;/code&gt; and traits from &lt;code&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28123453/what-is-the-difference-between-traits-in-rust-and-typeclasses-in-haskell"&gt;are a bit different&lt;/a&gt;, but we won't go into these details to keep this article rather short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what about Python?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#drypythonclasses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  dry-python/classes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an awesome function in the Python standard library called &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch"&gt;&lt;code&gt;singledispatch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does exactly what we need. Do you still remember that we are finding a way to change the function's behavior based on the input type?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;singledispatch&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;singledispatch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""Default case."""&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello, {0}!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Custom type
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dataclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_myuser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello again, {0}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looks cool, moreover, it is in standard lib, you even don't have to install anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we can use it like a normal function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello, world!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MyUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'example'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Hello again, example
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what's the point in writing a completely different library like we did with &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even reuse some parts of &lt;code&gt;singledispatch&lt;/code&gt; implementation,&lt;br&gt;
but there are several key differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#better-typing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Better typing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;singledispatch&lt;/code&gt; you cannot be sure that everything will work, because it is not supported by &lt;code&gt;mypy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can pass unsupported types:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# mypy is ok with that :(
# runtime will raise `NotImplementedError`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt; we have fixed that.&lt;br&gt;
You can only pass types that are supported:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Iterable!'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Argument 1 to "greet" has incompatible type "int"; expected "str"
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or you can break the &lt;code&gt;@singledispatch&lt;/code&gt; signature contract:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# still no mypy error
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, not with &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Instance callback is incompatible
# "def (instance: builtins.dict[Any, Any], key: builtins.str) -&amp;gt; builtins.int";
# expected
# "def (instance: builtins.dict[Any, Any]) -&amp;gt; builtins.str"
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@singledispatch&lt;/code&gt; also does not allow defining generic functions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;singledispatch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""Default case."""&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_copy_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Argument 1 to "register" of "_SingleDispatchCallable"
# has incompatible type "Callable[[int], int]";
# expected "Callable[..., X]"
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;reveal_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Revealed type is "X`-1"
# Should be: `int`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Which is, again, possible with &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt;, we fully support &lt;a href="https://classes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/generics.html"&gt;generic functions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;typing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TypeVar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TypeVar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_copy_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ok
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;reveal_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# int
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And you cannot &lt;a href="https://classes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/concept.html#type-restrictions"&gt;restrict&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;@singledispatch&lt;/code&gt; to work with only subtypes of specific types, even if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#protocols-are-unsupported"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Protocols are unsupported
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protocols are an important part of Python. Sadly, they are not supported by &lt;code&gt;@singledispatch&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Iterable!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# TypeError: Invalid annotation for 'instance'.
# typing.Iterable is not a class
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://classes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/concept.html#protocols"&gt;Protocols&lt;/a&gt; support is also solved with &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;typing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Iterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Iterable!'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Iterable!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#no-way-to-annotate-types"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  No way to annotate types
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want to write a function and annotate one of its arguments that it must support the &lt;code&gt;greet&lt;/code&gt; function. Something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet_and_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'???'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is impossible with &lt;code&gt;@singledispatch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
But, you can do it with &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AssociatedType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Supports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AssociatedType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""Special type to represent that some instance can `greet`."""&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;typeclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"""No implementation needed."""&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;_greet_str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Hello, {0}!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;greet_and_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Supports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet_and_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ok
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;greet_and_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# type error with mypy, exception in runtime
# Argument 1 to "greet_and_print" has incompatible type "int";
# expected "Supports[Greet]"
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have come a long way, from basic stacked &lt;code&gt;isinstance()&lt;/code&gt; conditions - through OOP - to typeclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have shown, that this native and pythonic idea deserves wider recognition and usage. And our extra features in &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt; can save you from lots of mistakes and help to write more expressive and safe business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of using typeclasses, you will untangle your structures from behavior, which will allow you to get rid of useless and complex abstractions and write dead-simple typesafe code. You will have your behavior near the structures, not inside them. This will also solve the extendability problem of OOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine it with other &lt;code&gt;dry-python&lt;/code&gt; libraries for extra effect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we plan for the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key aspects to improve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;Supports&lt;/code&gt; should take any amount of type arguments: &lt;code&gt;Supports[A, B, C]&lt;/code&gt;. This type will represent a type that supports all three typeclasses &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/dry-python/classes/issues/206"&gt;at the same time&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don't &lt;a href="https://github.com/dry-python/classes/issues/24"&gt;support concrete generics&lt;/a&gt; just yet. So, for example, it is impossible to define different cases for &lt;code&gt;List[int]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;List[str]&lt;/code&gt;. This might require adding runtime typecheker to &lt;code&gt;dry-python/classes&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am planning &lt;a href="https://sobolevn.me/2021/02/make-tests-a-part-of-your-app"&gt;to make tests a part of this app&lt;/a&gt; as well! We will ship a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dry-python/classes/issues/234"&gt;hypothesis plugin&lt;/a&gt; to test users' typeclasses in a single line of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Empty List placeholder. SwiftUI</title>
      <author>Anton Paliakou</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 14:15:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/toni777772/empty-list-placeholder-swiftui-4b7e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/toni777772/empty-list-placeholder-swiftui-4b7e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Year twenty twenty-one. Almost a month has passed since the WWDC. As usual Apple presented many amazing features/updates 😍. As expected updated SwiftUI framework. But did not add placeholder for &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list"&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; view 😭. It's not big deal, but it was one of my expectations from conference. Okay let's do it ourselves 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list"&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most used view in apps.&lt;br&gt;
When using the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list"&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, devs also must handle the state of an empty data range and show a placeholder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider a simple list of countries. Show placeholder when data is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4bd3NvI4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3s18nmf1lbowhm38q9z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4bd3NvI4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q3s18nmf1lbowhm38q9z.png" alt="Countries"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q281u_f4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r21n4v592v6rb7yl7gza.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q281u_f4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r21n4v592v6rb7yl7gza.png" alt="Placeholder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country model:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, have any ideas on how to implement a placeholder? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-idea-raw-if-else-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First idea &lt;code&gt;If else&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind it's &lt;a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Statements.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if else&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conditional statement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ContentView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Data source&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"No Countries"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Placeholder&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;largeTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// List countires&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the most simple and clear way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to modify &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it works and shows the placeholder when needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to use any view for placeholder &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code looks cumbersome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not reusable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works and sometimes it's enough. But in production, it would be nice to have a component that implements the logic of displaying a placeholder inside the component. So, goes to the next idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#second-idea-raw-emptylist-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Second idea &lt;code&gt;EmptyList&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improve &lt;code&gt;if else&lt;/code&gt; idea and move logic show/hide placeholder to custom view, call it &lt;code&gt;EmptyList&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;EmptyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;RandomAccessCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ListRowView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;PlaceholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;listRowView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ListRowView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;PlaceholderView&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;/// - Parameters:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;///   - items: Source data for List. Item must implement Identifiable protocol&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;///   - listRowView: View displayed for each source Item&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;///   - placeholderView: Placeholder. View displayed when the items collection isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@ViewBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;listRowView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@escaping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ListRowView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@ViewBuilder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@escaping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;PlaceholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;listRowView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;listRowView&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;placeholderView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;placeholderView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// List countires&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;listRowView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;placeholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;EmptyList&lt;/code&gt; is very easy. First parameter - data source, second parameter -  list row view, and finally third parameter - placeholder view.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ContentView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Data source&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;EmptyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Data items &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;listRowView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// List row view&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"No Countries"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Placeholder&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;largeTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code looks clean and clear 😍&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to modify custom view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reusable in project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use any view for placeholder &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;list is embedded in &lt;code&gt;EmptyList&lt;/code&gt; view, and if want to add some ViewModifier-s to the list, need for more efforts and modify code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, I would have to say that this is all and say goodbye but is not all 😎. I want to share an idea of how I cook placeholder for lists in my projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preferred-idea-raw-viewmodifier-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preferred idea &lt;code&gt;ViewModifier&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create custom &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ViewModifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to manage placeholder, call it &lt;code&gt;EmptyDataModifier&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;EmptyDataModifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ViewModifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Placeholder&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@ViewBuilder&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uses  &lt;code&gt;EmptyDataModifier&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ContentView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Data source&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;modifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;EmptyDataModifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"No Countries"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Placeholder&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! Also via extension can little bit improve the solution and limited apply &lt;code&gt;EmptyDataModifier&lt;/code&gt; only for &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;extension&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;emptyListPlaceholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AnyView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nf"&gt;modifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;EmptyDataModifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;placeholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;ContentView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;@State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Data source&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;font&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;emptyListPlaceholder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;countries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kt"&gt;AnyView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;ListPlaceholderView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Placeholder &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code look clean and clear 😍 😍 😍&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no need to create a custom &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to modify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reusable in project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use any view for placeholder &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this way for can be used for any view placeholder &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no  (subjective opinion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#instead-of-summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Instead of summary
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the most suitable way to implement a placeholder is to use a custom &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/viewmodifier"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ViewModifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
I'm sure sooner or later the Apple will add a placeholder for the List view. Maybe this article will be as a request for this feature for Apple. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Toni77777/ListPlaceholderSample"&gt;Source code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! See you soon. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing with anxiety during job interviews</title>
      <author>Zell Liew 🤗</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 13:43:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/zellwk/dealing-with-anxiety-during-job-interviews-6p6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/zellwk/dealing-with-anxiety-during-job-interviews-6p6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's normal to feel anxious when applying for a job. After all, you're trying to present your best self in hopes of getting the job. Today's article will help you learn to control or work with this anxiousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose four ways to work through your anxiousness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be pessimistic about the interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't care about the results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face the anxiousness head-on and work through it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your real self instead of your best self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-pessimistic-about-the-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be pessimistic about the interview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you apply to a job via the standard channel&lt;/strong&gt; (applying through job ad), &lt;strong&gt;your odds of being selected is very low.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to understand this fact and &lt;strong&gt;treat job search as a numbers game&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don't want to admit that their chances are low and they try to "be their best self" in an interview. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/trying-your-best/"&gt;being your best self is a bad strategy&lt;/a&gt; and it sets you up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You won't be able to understand why you failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll take the failure personally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll feel lousy and sucky and you lose motivation to apply for another job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you acknowledge your chances of being successful is low, you'll adjust your expectations. You won't get hurt as much when you fail (and you will probably fail many times). You will be able to get up and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn the lessons from your previous interview and use it for your next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-care-about-the-results"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't care about the results
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're anxious because we care about the results. We won't be anxious if we don't care about the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important because anxiety lowers our performance. When we care for something too much, we tend to overcompensate. You've heard of people "trying too hard" and coming off as a turn-off. I went through an experience like this too in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I interviewed for a program during my university years. It was a prestigious program in my university and many people clamoured for it. I clamoured for it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went into the interview, I was very nervous. I tried to put up my best performance. I tried to be polite, I tried to offer suggestions, and even tried to lead the discussion amongst my peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I did pretty well, but I heard nothing from the faculty after the interview. I was devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied for the same program again 1 year later. This time, I just came back from an overseas trip and I learned to relax a bit. I figured it would be great if I got accepted into the program, but I wasn't really bothered if I didn't get accepted — life goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this interview, I sat down and didn't try to perform. I relaxed. I just spoke my mind about stuff. One of the interviewers (a teacher) even said I was rude during the interview. She said I should stand up when addressing a teacher. I went out of the interview thinking I probably failed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I received a call within a week or two and I was offered a chance to go for the program. 🙄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What actually happened? What were the criteria that made them call me and gave me a chance? 🤷‍♂️. I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've noticed this same pattern played out over the years — when I'm really concerned about something, it would turn out badly. But if I don't really care, it has the potential to turn out well. 🤷‍♂️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;fuck the results&lt;/strong&gt;. Enjoy yourself. Things may turn out better than you wished it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#face-the-anxiousness-headon-and-work-through-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Face the anxiousness head-on and work through it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason why you're anxious is because you don't have enough interviewing experience. You lack experiential information about how an interview is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can prepare all you want — answering generic questions, doing code katas, etc — but you won't be able to shake off this anxiousness, especially if you really want this job. (&lt;a href="#don%E2%80%99t-care-about-the-results"&gt;See point 2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To reduce this anxiety, you have to gain experience&lt;/strong&gt;. This means you'll have to go for many interviews. With each interview you'll know what to expect and what to do. You'll also learn to manage possible failure (assuming you're didn't beat yourself up too hard &lt;a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/trying-your-best"&gt;by trying your best&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take each interview as a practice. With enough practice, you'll know what to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the same approach if you want to put up a blog, do youtube videos, or livestream. You have to do work through the anxiousness and you'll learn to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bring-your-real-self-instead-of-your-best-self"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bring your real self instead of your best self
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you bring your best self, you're putting on a mask — you're not the real you. You're uncomfortable because you know you're not being yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's second problem — if they hired you when you "tried your best", you have to put on this "best behaviour" for the rest of your life in the company. Since you're not being yourself, you'll get even more stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;don't fake it till you make it.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't fake anything because faking introduces stress with yourself internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring your real self&lt;/strong&gt; to the interview table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have so many fragmented selves that we're not sure which is real. The answer is everyone of them is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The you where you're excited about code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The you where you're anxious about making mistakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The you where you're grumpy because you couldn't solve a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The you where you're being super unhealthy, eating potato chips on the sofa when you're supposed to be on a diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them are real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to &lt;strong&gt;bring the self that makes most sense&lt;/strong&gt; for this interview. (I hope you know which one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a good thing if you get rejected for being real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company may be an ill-fit for you — they may look for someone who wants to follow instructions while you want to make an impact (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who are you when you're having fun coding, exploring ideas, studying tutorials, debugging errors? Bring that person to the interview and let the rest play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine you're not in an interview&lt;/strong&gt;. Imagine the person sitting across you is a friend and you're in a safe place. Imagine they are there for you to share your thoughts, excitement, and love about web development. And you're simply sharing everything you found exciting with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;br&gt;
I know it's not safe since you're being evaluated, but imagine it anyway. Your worst case scenario is you don't get accepted (and there's a high chance anyway). What's there to lose if you gave this a try?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then don't care about the results of the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is too short for unnecessary worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace this mindset and try it out for a couple of weeks. Maybe the results will change the way you handle such situations going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Documentando código Python com Type Hints</title>
      <author>Flávio Filipe</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 13:13:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/flaviofilipe/documentando-codigo-python-com-type-hints-3d19</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/flaviofilipe/documentando-codigo-python-com-type-hints-3d19</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introdução
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiquei um pouco confuso ao começar a estudar sobre a declaração explícita com Python. Ao tentar comparar com outras linguagens como Java, C++ ou Typescript a compreensão começa a ficar um pouco problemática. Para entender o que é, para que serve e quando utilizar é preciso entender o motivo da sua criação.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para começar precisamos ressaltar duas coisas importantes sobre o Python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;É uma linguagem fortemente tipada, isto é, cada variável tem um tipo e em alguns casos é preciso convertê-las para realizar operações, por exemplo: &lt;code&gt;‘1’ + 1&lt;/code&gt; irá retornar uma exceção pois os tipos são diferentes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;É uma linguagem de tipagem dinâmica. Isso significa que podemos alterar o tipo da variável ao longo do programa, como por exemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# n é do tipo inteiro
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;teste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# n é do tipo string
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vantagens-da-tipagem-est%C3%A1tica"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vantagens da Tipagem Estática
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grande vantagem de se trabalhar com linguagens de tipagem estática é que ao definir o seu tipo: garantimos que não teremos problemas em tentar somar um &lt;em&gt;inteiro&lt;/em&gt; com uma &lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt; durante o desenvolvimento do código. &lt;br&gt;
Outra vantagem é poder entender os tipos de dados que uma função está esperando, apontando um erro imediato na IDE durante a escrita do código caso o parâmetro passado seja de um tipo diferente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mas e se tratando de &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, como podemos ganhar agilidade no desenvolvimento e evitar erros comuns com os tipos de dados e deixar claro para quem for dar manutenção no futuro os tipos de dados que esperamos trabalhar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vamos considerar o código abaixo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;soma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olhando para ele fica difícil saber o real propósito da sua criação. Ele foi criado para somar números, textos ou listas? O que aconteceria se eu passasse um número no primeiro parâmetro e um texto no segundo? Precisamos deixar claro para quem precisar olhar para este código no futuro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#docstring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Docstring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/"&gt;PEP-257&lt;/a&gt;, com a chegada do Docstring, é apresentada uma convenção para documentar nossas funções. Abaixo um exemplo com a tentativa de facilitar nosso entendimento:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;soma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'''
        Retorna a soma de dois números inteiros
        Params:
            a (int)
            b (int)
    '''&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dependendo da IDE ou editor de texto utilizado, ao chamar esta função e passar o mouse por cima, ele irá apresentar a sua documentação. Mas pensando no cenário onde teremos vários métodos e para todos eles precisaríamos criar um &lt;em&gt;docstring&lt;/em&gt; somente para informar o tipo de parâmetro e seu retorno acaba se tornando uma tarefa repetitiva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decoradores-para-fun%C3%A7%C3%B5es-e-m%C3%A9todos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decoradores para Funções e Métodos
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/"&gt;PEP-318&lt;/a&gt;, com a chegada dos decoradores para as funções e métodos, é apresentado uma sintaxe para ser utilizada com a finalidade de definir os tipos de parâmetros e retorno, assim poderíamos simplificar nossa documentação criando uma funçao de para informar os parâmetros e retorno:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accepts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;returns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;soma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aqui temos alguns exemplos da utilização dos decorators para facilitar o entendimento deles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pythonacademy.com.br/blog/domine-decorators-em-python"&gt;https://pythonacademy.com.br/blog/domine-decorators-em-python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/"&gt;https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finalmente-os-annotations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finalmente os &lt;em&gt;Annotations&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No ano de 2006, com a chegada do Python 3, a &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/"&gt;PEP-3107&lt;/a&gt; nos trouxe uma outra forma de documentar nosso código com as Anotações de Função. Agora nós podemos fazer as anotações dentro do parâmetro da função e logo em seguida informar seu retorno, que basicamente fazem o uso das anotations para fazer o mapeamento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-hints"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type Hints
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/"&gt;PEP-483&lt;/a&gt; nos trás uma nova “teoria” da proposta de implementação de tipos para o Python 3.5 Segue a citação que deixa bem claro o real propósito da nova implementação sugerida:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;É importante que o usuário seja capaz de definir os tipos de uma forma que possa ser entendida por verificadores de tipo. O objetivo deste PEP é propor uma forma sistemática de definir tipos para anotações de tipo de variáveis ​​e funções usando a sintaxe &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107"&gt;PEP 3107&lt;/a&gt; . Essas anotações podem ser usadas para evitar muitos tipos de bugs, para fins de documentação, ou talvez até mesmo para aumentar a velocidade de execução do programa. Aqui, nos concentramos apenas em evitar bugs usando um verificador de tipo estático.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Porém é com a &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/"&gt;PEP-484&lt;/a&gt; que isso acontece, com a chegada dos Type Hints ou Dicas de Tipo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segue um exemplo atualizado usando a nova sintaxe e falaremos sobre ele em seguida:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;soma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora, de uma forma mais semântica, conseguimos documentar melhor nosso método. Fica claro os tipos de dados de entrada e saída. Agora vamos à "confusão" citada no início deste artigo quando tentei comparar com outras linguagens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ao olharmos o histórico da implementação podemos perceber que esta funcionalidade está mais ligada a &lt;strong&gt;documentação&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;legibilidade do código&lt;/strong&gt; ao invés de tornar a linguagem estática. Sendo assim, diferente de outras linguagens estáticas, ao fazer uma declaração explícita dos valores de entrada ele não nos obriga a informá-los ou proíbe a mudança de tipo ao longo do código. Isso significa que o código abaixo ainda é um código válido:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;soma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;soma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'ab'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Isso ocorre porque o intuito é &lt;strong&gt;DOCUMENTAR&lt;/strong&gt; e não obrigar os tipos de entrada e saída. A grande vantagem desta funcionalidade está no desenvolvimento se combinado com a ferramenta de terceiros para fazer a validação no código.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilizando uma IDE ou um editor de texto configurado para o python, ao escrever o código acima seria apresentado um erro informando que os tipos de dados são incompatíveis. Outras ferramentas, como o &lt;a href="http://mypy-lang.org/"&gt;MyPy&lt;/a&gt;, podem garantir se o código segue as regras de implementação propostas. Com isso em mente, vamos explorar um pouco mais o que podemos fazer com os Types Hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eu estou utilizando o PyCharm, uma IDE feita para Python. Ela tem uma ótima integração com os Type Hints fazendo as validações em tempo de desenvolvimento. Mas sintam-se a vontade para testar em outros editores. Você poderá executar o MyPy sempre que quiser testar suas implementações&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exemplos-com-type-hints"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  EXEMPLOS COM TYPE HINTS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exemplo-1-precisamos-passar-uma-lista-de-palabras-para-um-m%C3%A9todo-fazer-algum-tipo-de-valida%C3%A7%C3%A3o-nelas-assim-precisamos-especificar-o-tipo-de-lista-que-estamos-esperando"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exemplo 1: Precisamos passar uma lista de palabras para um método fazer algum tipo de validação nelas. Assim, precisamos especificar o tipo de lista que estamos esperando:
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;validar_palavras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;palavras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'teste'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;palavras&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;validate_words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'Nome'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'teste'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Utilizando o &lt;code&gt;list[str]&lt;/code&gt; informamos que estamos esperando uma lista de palavras para nossa função. No método acima o &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; bool&lt;/code&gt; informa que o retorno é um &lt;em&gt;boleano&lt;/em&gt; (Verdadeiro ou Falso).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exemplo-2-precisamos-dar-as-boas-vindas-ao-su%C3%A1rio-por-isso-iremos-criar-um-m%C3%A9todo-que-recebe-o-nome-e-o-status-do-usu%C3%A1rio-se-ele-tiver-o-status-ativo-ir%C3%A1-retornar-a-mensagem-raw-bem-vindo-ltnomegt-endraw-mas-se-ele-possuir-o-status-suspenso-dever%C3%A1-retornar-a-mensagem-raw-usu%C3%A1rio-suspenso-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exemplo 2: Precisamos dar as boas vindas ao suário. Por isso iremos criar um método que recebe o nome e o status do usuário, se ele tiver o status ATIVO irá retornar a mensagem: &lt;code&gt;Bem vindo &amp;lt;NOME&amp;gt;!&lt;/code&gt;. Mas se ele possuir o status SUSPENSO deverá retornar a mensagem: &lt;code&gt;Usuário Suspenso!&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;typing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TypedDict&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;  


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UserStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ATIVO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;SUSPENSO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;  


&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UserType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TypedDict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;nome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStatus&lt;/span&gt;  


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;boas_vindas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'status'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SUSPENSO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Usuário Suspenso!'&lt;/span&gt;  

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Bem vindo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'nome'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;  


&lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario_ativo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'nome'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Usuário Ativo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'status'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'ativo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario_suspenso&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'nome'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'Usuário Suspenso'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'status'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SUSPENSO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;boas_vindas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario_ativo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;boas_vindas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usuario_suspenso&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Para este exemplo nós criamos duas &lt;em&gt;classes&lt;/em&gt; para ser a referência de tipo de entrada para nossa função. A class &lt;code&gt;UserStatus&lt;/code&gt; será usada para definir nossos tipos padrões de status aceitos, enquanto a &lt;code&gt;UserType&lt;/code&gt; serão os tipos de dados esperados pelo usuário.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caso vc esteja utilizando o PyCharm ou algum editor configurado para reconhecer os tipos verá que poderá utilizar o autocomplete e caso passe algum parâmetro errado o próprio editor já acusa que há um erro:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KpY8S5NL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gxPc-oaNy5QMJe7lC4BfubTDxbn1_0NlyMiD6Z8DLgwNptfLORbg1GniykxD3H3Zyds9jTGDXEhqcrRl55kMnzKC_Xmr36FEvq0sp8fAAIaBWByPDZtWpiVrJhFRCEUgSAm6lJFj" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KpY8S5NL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gxPc-oaNy5QMJe7lC4BfubTDxbn1_0NlyMiD6Z8DLgwNptfLORbg1GniykxD3H3Zyds9jTGDXEhqcrRl55kMnzKC_Xmr36FEvq0sp8fAAIaBWByPDZtWpiVrJhFRCEUgSAm6lJFj" alt="Mensagem de tipo inesperado para o status do usuário"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você poderá usar também a opção do autocomplete apertando ctrl+espaço:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TEp1CqG1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/P7Bjsifc_CddFdXRdEHHRUfOc1tJQXP1uIbZ58U64YFQ8nCh76kHNy7H5y64U8yanc9htujsmD5RLWaJk5GnRluXwkcth56EDVh-O9PFwoQf2bTlH9kepstzODAa9I7r8Sf4epHQ" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TEp1CqG1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/P7Bjsifc_CddFdXRdEHHRUfOc1tJQXP1uIbZ58U64YFQ8nCh76kHNy7H5y64U8yanc9htujsmD5RLWaJk5GnRluXwkcth56EDVh-O9PFwoQf2bTlH9kepstzODAa9I7r8Sf4epHQ" alt="Sugestão de autocomplete para o usuário"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Para conhecer mais como definir os tipos com classes poderá consultar a &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/"&gt;PEP-589&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tipo-de-dados"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tipo de dados
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para conhecermos melhor os tipos em python podemos utilizar o método &lt;code&gt;type(var)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Os mais comuns são:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tipo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Descrição&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Exemplo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;str&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Texto&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'hello'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;int&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Número Inteiro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 , 2, 3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;float&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Número Real&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.0, 2.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;list&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lista&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;dict&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dicionário&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{'title': 'post 1', 'category': 1 }&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclus%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusão
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Com a declaração explicita podemos: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentar melhor nosso código&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ter segurança na hora de fazer o refatoramento&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aproveitar ao máximo o autocomplete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pensar melhor nos dados da nossa aplicação&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deixar o código mais claro e limpo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Technical Interview Preparation and Tips To Consider</title>
      <author>Braydon Coyer</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 12:51:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/braydoncoyer/technical-interview-preparation-and-tips-to-consider-1n4h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/braydoncoyer/technical-interview-preparation-and-tips-to-consider-1n4h</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was taken and expanded upon from &lt;a href="https://braydoncoyer.dev/newsletter/"&gt;my newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you get nervous when taking a technical interview? I assume we all do — no matter how much experience we have under our belt. The truth is - technical interviews are a process we all have to go through at some point (and usually many times) as developers. The imposter syndrome kicks in and we are tempted to think we don’t belong in the industry. Sometimes we panic and freeze, where other times we manage to hide the nerves better than others. How do you react?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m preparing for an interview, I often think of things I should say or should do and perform a self-retrospective after to identify ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, though, as I conduct interviews for my company that operates in an Extreme Programming environment, I’ve been given a new perspective on tips and patterns to follow in future interviews. If you're looking for a new development job, I'd like to share these interview tips and highlights with you. Let's take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interview-tip-1-be-authentic-and-honest-in-preparation-and-execution-of-your-technical-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interview tip #1: Be authentic and honest in preparation and execution of your technical interview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, don’t oversell yourself. Don’t get me wrong - I’m not saying that you sabotage your own job interview; you have experience and worth, but there’s a difference between showing your worth and overselling yourself. Developer candidates have told me they have experience with a language, framework or agile methodology and when I ask a question to gauge their understanding, it becomes obvious that they have little to no experience at all. As an interviewer, it’s very off-putting and a waste of time - now I have to try to find where they truly are on the experience spectrum. Not a great first impression, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of overselling yourself, be honest with the interviewer and respond accordingly. The interviewer will no doubt have reviewed your resume and has an idea of your experience, so make sure you appropriately set the expectations of the interviewer going in - and then knock their socks off. Don’t make the mistake of exaggerating your experience and as a result looking like a weak candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now - I understand that many job applications “require” that candidates have years and years of experience in certain technologies for the pertaining role. More times than not, these numbers are unrealistic and can be a deterrent for considering applicants. I believe technical hiring is broken and &lt;a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/"&gt;this article by Aline Lerner’s blog does a great job examining the problems.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the years of experience needed for applications, if you think you can provide value to the company for that position, you should apply! Most of the interviews I’ve taken have listed requirements that I didn’t fit - and yet I did well in the interview and even got a few offers. Send in your resume with honest information, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interview-tip-2-show-youre-a-lifetime-learner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interview tip #2: Show you're a life-time learner
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, being a developer means that you’ve dedicated yourself to being a life-time learner. Constant learning requires discipline, time and effort as said by &lt;a href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/true-programmers-never-stop-learning/"&gt;Thibaud Jobert in his article about the endless cycle of learning&lt;/a&gt;. When you’re interviewing, there will be times when you're asked a question and you don't know the answer. Perhaps it's a detailed programming problem you need to solve, or maybe a more general question about your experience with a certain framework. Either way, if you don’t know the answer or don’t have the experience, inform the interviewer while also displaying a willingness to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example: “I don’t have experience in that area, but I’m a diligent learner and I know I can upscale myself to fulfill that requirement. I was previously put in a situation that allowed me to learn a new framework and by the end of the project, I was teaching other members on my team and we delivered a successful product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This response does a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admitting you lack some knowledge (honesty is key, remember.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressing a willingness to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing credibility by explain past experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interview-tip-3-cheating-hurts-you-more-than-it-may-help-you-in-a-technical-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interview tip #3: Cheating hurts you more than it may help you in a technical interview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don’t cheat. I know this sounds obvious, but it hurts you in more ways than one. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen developers clearly referencing a solution to a coding problem and yet they can’t answer a basic question about the code they just “wrote”. By cheating they focus too much on the leaked solution and end up not understanding the implementation and what the code is actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there’s a difference between researching before a technical interview and cheating during the interview itself. In fact, I commend those who dedicate some time to research my company and interview process. It shows me the candidate is (hopefully) interested in what we do. It also allows them to gain some general information about the interview and what they can expect. What did other people think of the interview? Was it difficult? Glassdoor may even have some vague description about the broad type of questions candidates are expected to answer. Researching these things are all fine, but finding a leaked solution to use during the interview is deceitful, it’s &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; obvious to the interviewer and should result in an immediate disqualification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t cheat. You’re smart! Move slowly and think through the problem or question asked of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interview-tip-4-ask-good-questions-in-a-technical-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interview tip #4: Ask good questions in a technical interview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t make assumptions about what’s being asked of you - this can cost you valuable time. Approach technical problems and coding challenges with a fresh mind and ask clarifying questions to understand the problem scope along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one of my responsibilities as an interviewer is to help guide candidates towards the finish line, sometimes I let them wander when they’re taking a coding challenge to see if they’ll make it there on their own. This, in itself, can help me gauge one’s experience and understanding, but many times a simple question directed at me from the candidate can save them time, realign their compass and highlight possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking questions doesn’t shine a bad light on you. Rather, a good candidate asks directed questions at the appropriate time, revealing your engaged mindset to the interviewer. This skill only comes with practice, but performing a retrospective on past interviews and evaluating how you could have asked better questions is a great way to prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also get in the habit of preparing questions to pose to the interviewer or manager at the end of the interview. Ask about the company. Ask about methodologies and workflows. Ask about the team you’re being evaluated to join. It never hurts to show interest in the position, the company and work they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview preparation helps you get ready beforehand, but it also sets you up for success as you showcase your skills during the interview. Remember - be authentic, show your willingness to learn, don’t cheat and make sure you ask good questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have anything else to add? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BraydonCoyer"&gt;Hit me up on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - I’d love to hear what you have to say!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating More Accessible CSS Art</title>
      <author>Alvaro Montoro</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 12:32:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/creating-more-accessible-css-art-179n</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/creating-more-accessible-css-art-179n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CSS art has been a thing since the creation of CSS itself. It is a great way of practicing and learning and it makes for an interesting coding challenge. But it has a big problem: CSS art is inherently not accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will not see how to create CSS drawings and illustrations (there are plenty of those posts). Instead, we will focus on some tips and best practices to make that CSS art more accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After applying these techniques, your CSS art will be friendlier for screen-reader users, people with specific color needs and preferences, people with vestibular disorders or vertigo... and all without impacting your art or limiting your creativity. It's a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a working example of the tips in the article, check &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/WNwrPmW"&gt;this CSS illustration&lt;/a&gt;. And without further ado, let's see the recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#identify-the-css-art-as-an-image"&gt;Identify the CSS art as an image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#add-alternative-text"&gt;Add alternative text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#go-pixelperfect-or-go-for-scalable-design"&gt;Go pixel-perfect... or go for scalable design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#use-semantic-html-elements"&gt;Use semantic HTML elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#be-mindful-with-the-animations"&gt;Be mindful with the animations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#consider-peoples-color-choices"&gt;Consider people's color choices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#set-the-aspect-ratio"&gt;Set the aspect ratio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identify-the-css-art-as-an-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identify the CSS art as an image
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main things to do is identifying the CSS art as an image. We can do that by changing the container and adding &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Role_Img"&gt;&lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; ARIA role&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"img"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML of the image --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By adding this ARIA role, the assistive technologies will announce the container of the CSS art as an image when they reach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author's note: from now on, our CSS art will be identified as an image, so the terms "CSS art", "drawing", "illustration", or "image" may be used interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-alternative-text"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add alternative text
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the screen readers announce the CSS art as an image, it is important to also provide some description or alternative text as a regular image would do with the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-alt"&gt;&lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can achieve this by adding an &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aria-label&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/a&gt; to the image, and providing the alternative text there:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-label=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"The alternative text goes here"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML of the image --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will work just fine but, in the unlikely (but possible) case of the CSS not loading properly, may not be enough for what we want. That's why we prefer using the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aria-labelledby&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/a&gt; instead:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-labelledby=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alt-image"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alt-image"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;The alternative text goes here&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML of the image --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This solution will include the label as text, which will be hidden using an accessible technique. There are many possibilities for doing this; a simple one can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2013-01-11-how-to-hide-content/"&gt;The A11Y Project's website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#alt-image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;white-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nowrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This way, if the CSS doesn't load, the alternative text will be displayed. Similarly to how the alternative text of a native &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be displayed on the page if the image fails to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#go-pixelperfect-or-go-for-scalable-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Go pixel-perfect... or go for scalable design
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something &lt;strong&gt;to consider even before we start any coding&lt;/strong&gt;: do we want a pixel-perfect drawing? or do we want something responsive that will scale nicely (at the cost of sometimes not being displayed perfectly fine)? Of course, the answers will have consequences on how we create the CSS art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to achieve a pixel-perfect result, we should use &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#absolute_length_units"&gt;absolute units&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pt&lt;/code&gt;, etc. This way, our image will have a fixed size and won't be responsive (although it will scale better than raster images as it is a vectorial drawing), and we should be able to use any CSS property and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we will use &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#relative_length_units"&gt;relative units&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vmin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, etc. if we want to achieve scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going for scalability will require some additional considerations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result will be scalable and responsive... or at least, have the capacity of being responsive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should be cautious with some CSS properties that don't work with all relative units (e.g. &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width"&gt;&lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should avoid some CSS values that don't take relative units (e.g. at the moment &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path"&gt;&lt;code&gt;clip-path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be relative with &lt;code&gt;polygon()&lt;/code&gt; but not with &lt;code&gt;path()&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with either approach. For artistic drawings, we may most likely opt for scalability and responsiveness; while for more &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; things like icons or backgrounds, a pixel-perfect result could be more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-semantic-html-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use semantic HTML elements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML5 provides many semantic elements. There is no need to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for every part of our drawing, and especially for the container. The real question would be "Which one?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author's note: I understand my pick of semantic elements could be debatable. I will try to keep them as neutral/objective as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there's a couple of elements that seem ideal for the case: &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the latter may seem the obvious choice, the former has additional semantic advantages, as we'll soon see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, we have &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A self-contained content with an optional caption (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) that could be used as alternative text:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;figure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-labelledby=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alt-image"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alt-image"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here goes the alternative text&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML of the image --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This choice seems like an exact fit for what we want to do, but we also need to consider &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: a complete, self-contained, and independent composition intended to be distributed or reused. Precisely what our CSS art is!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML of the image --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Which semantic HTML element to pick? That would be up to the author and how the CSS art will be presented to the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people already mentioned that having an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; within an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; isn't allowed, but that's incorrect. &lt;a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element"&gt;An article can contain another article&lt;/a&gt;. When there are nested articles, the inner article must be related to the outer article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; also allows for a more natural use of other semantic HTML elements like headings for the illustration title/alternative text, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the author's information, or &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;time&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the creation date:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-labelledby=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"image-alt"&lt;/span&gt; 
         &lt;span class="na"&gt;aria-describedby=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"image-info"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- The whole header would be accessibly hidden --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"image-alt"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title/Alternative text&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"image-info"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Created by 
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://twitter.com/alvaro_montoro"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          Alvaro Montoro
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/address&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      on
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;datetime=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"2021-06-10"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;June 10th, 2021&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/time&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- HTML of the image --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-mindful-with-the-animations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be mindful with the animations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, CSS art includes some type of animation: a dog wagging its tail, a person moving or blinking, an airplane flying and looping...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we include animations into our CSS art, we need to consider that there are people who may not like animations or who suffer from disorders (e.g. &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/"&gt;vestibular disorders or vertigo&lt;/a&gt;) that make those animations annoying and painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to provide a way to disable or replace those animations with something different. Luckily, CSS offers the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/code&gt; media query&lt;/a&gt; that allows developers to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can disable an animation by doing something like this (adding the class "animated" to the elements that have animations):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-reduced-motion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.animated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also need to take into account that not all animations are equal, and not all will cause problems. &lt;strong&gt;Instead of disabling all the animations, maybe we should consider replacing them&lt;/strong&gt; with friendlier ones or adjusting the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consider-peoples-color-choices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consider people's color choices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some operating system allow users to enable additional accessibility features and, in some cases, CSS is able to identify them using media queries and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of them are experimental and &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=forced-colors"&gt;not widely supported&lt;/a&gt;, but they can be used to expand our CSS art once support is more extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These media queries are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefers-contrast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: to indicate if the user wants a higher or lower contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: to detect if the user requested dark/light color theme (often used for night/day modes.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors"&gt;&lt;code&gt;forced colors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: to specify if the user chose a limited color palette.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-contrast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* more: higher contrast colors, borders, no transparencies */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* less: lower contrast colors */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prefers-colors-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* dark: drawing with more contrast vs dark background */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* light: drawing with more contrast vs light background */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;forced-colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;/* override properties like box-shadow, add borders, etc. */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties"&gt;CSS custom properties&lt;/a&gt; (aka CSS variables) will make these media queries really useful and simple (we should only redefine the variable values.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more extreme cases, we may want to avoid some CSS properties. For example, &lt;code&gt;box-shadow&lt;/code&gt;, which is forced to 'none' in forced-colors mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-the-aspect-ratio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set the aspect ratio
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newer property useful when creating responsive CSS art is &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aspect-ratio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With it, we will be able to set the preferred aspect ratio for the image, which will be used for calculating the auto sizes when scaling:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This CSS art will be squared */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#myCSSart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;aspect-ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This CSS art will be twice as tall as it is wide */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#myCSSart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;aspect-ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is more of a convenience for the developer, but it can be helpful for accessibility as it ensures that the CSS art will not be stretched and distorted. And it has &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=aspect-ratio"&gt;decent support&lt;/a&gt; by browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
