      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hawk is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.&lt;br&gt;
Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan, host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), banner grabbing, DNS checks (with geolocation information), WHOIS, subdomain enumeration, vulnerability reconnaissance, packet sniffing, MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, SYN flooding, deauth attack and brute-force attack (beta).&lt;br&gt;
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.&lt;br&gt;
If you want to become a contributor, make a pull request or issue.&lt;br&gt;
Waiting for your feedback. Kudos&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feeling Frustrated and Overwhelmed? Nine Tips on Managing the Learning Process in Data Science</title>
      <author>Angelica Lo Duca</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:43:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alod83/feeling-frustrated-and-overwhelmed-nine-tips-on-managing-the-learning-process-in-data-science-m2l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alod83/feeling-frustrated-and-overwhelmed-nine-tips-on-managing-the-learning-process-in-data-science-m2l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The work of the Data Scientist, as we know, requires a lot of skills, including statistics and math concepts, visualizations skills, and programming knowledge. For a beginner, all of these requirements could be a deterrent. In fact, one might think of leaving without even taking the first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I describe my experience and how I began to take my first steps in the immense jungle of Data Science. Basically, by following nine simple steps, and with a lot of patience, you can become a (good) Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Starting the Journey of the Data Scientist&lt;br&gt;
Before we get into the world of Data Science and then put the tips I will describe into practice, there is a bigger battle to be fought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first real battle is against anxiety. Yes, because, taken by too much work, you might think you have to do everything immediately in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was, in fact, my first impact with Data Science: I wanted to know how to do everything, even before starting.&lt;br&gt;
In carrying out the work of the data scientist, I personally felt anxiety in these cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dataset too complex to analyze — while applying many preprocessing techniques and the like, the dataset still remained large and complex;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Machine Learning algorithm that takes too long to train — waiting for the result is nerve-wracking;
an impending deadline and still partial results;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a piece of code that doesn't work - it's frustrating to spend hours and hours trying to get code to work or find a solution to a problem, sadly without success;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too many concepts to learn (especially regarding statistics and maths) and little time to study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have experienced anxiety while starting the Data Scientist journey in other situations, feel free to comment on this article. I will be happy to update the previous list with other anxiety situations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I thought, this situation couldn’t go on. I stopped to reflect and in the end I developed nine tips to put into practice to start the journey of the data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-keep-calm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1 Keep Calm!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first way to begin the learning process is to keep calm. Theoretically it seems obvious, but practically, perhaps it is the most difficult thing to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping calm is a virtue of the strong. It involves strong self-control, endless patience and great temperance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to staying calm, for example before learning a complex statistic concept, is to withdraw from the situation. Just think about the present and imagine having your whole life available to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-read-and-study"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2 Read and Study
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect to become a good Data Scientist is to have a good knowledge of the topics covered. The only way to be sure how to proceed with data cleansing, analysis, etc., is to study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no other choice: I have to study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot leave with my car without starting the engine first. And the same goes for the work of the data scientist. I can't train a model if I don't have some theoretical knowledge first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study techniques can vary: you can take a manual and study, you can read articles about it, etc. Personally, I prefer to read interesting articles and test examples, because only by practicing I can learn something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my experience, the only way to progress in knowledge of a subject is to set aside time for study, whether it is an hour a day or an hour a week. The important thing is that this time exists. Surely the time spent studying is not time wasted, on the contrary, it helps to make progress quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-ask-for-help"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3 Ask for Help
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working on the computer, we often forget that we are not alone. Many times I spent a lot of time searching for the solution on Google, sometimes with success, sometimes without success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, someone else may already have the solution to a problem ready, which seems insurmountable to us.&lt;br&gt;
Over time I have learned that there are numerous communities of data scientists, very willing to help me in times of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there are Data Science communities on Quora, Stackoverflow, Reddit, Linkedin and in general on all social networks. Just ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-organize-the-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4 Organize the Work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to combat anxiety, another fundamental element is the organization of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time I have learned that a piece of paper is worth more than a thousand documents on the cloud, precisely because it allows me to touch (and focus with my eyes) all the things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I took an old diary and started writing down all the things to do month by month. I have considered each Data Science task a single thing to do and to learn. I have highlighted each completed task in yellow. What a satisfaction to see the diary gradually turning yellow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the agenda, the my knowledge of the various topics has gradually increased, because everything is immediately under control and it is easier to organize the work to be done today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-measure-my-strength"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5 Measure My Strength
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of doing so many things, I started too many Data Science activities or projects and eventually fell into the anxiety of not succeeding.&lt;br&gt;
From these experiences I learned to measure my strength, balancing the workload to what I can actually do and the time I have available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not about having or not having the skills to start a new Data Science project or a new business. Instead, it is a question of measuring one's strength, to avoid rushing things and falling back into failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-do-not-expect-too-much-of-myself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6 Do not Expect Too Much of Myself
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely related to the previous point is not expecting too much of yourself. To tell the truth, I have sometimes found myself demanding more of myself than I could give at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are moments in life when you perform more and others when you progress more slowly. The important thing is to never stop. All the same, even if for a while, you walk more slowly.&lt;br&gt;
For example, I can't expect to make beautiful &lt;br&gt;
Mike Bostock visualizations if my skills don't go beyond Excel!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The importance of using Git correctly and how to use it.</title>
      <author>Drew Pellum</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:38:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/apellum/the-importance-of-using-git-correctly-and-how-to-use-it-1dpn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/apellum/the-importance-of-using-git-correctly-and-how-to-use-it-1dpn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we know you can store your code in Github, but what are the other benefits? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git allows you to create new branches of code to work on without updating the main branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is cool, but why is that important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pushing only to the main branch, you can have typos in your code. This can break the code that is already working. Not ideal buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating Code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's cool to have code that always works, but if it never updates, then it will get left behind. Each day is an opportunity to learn what best practices in the industry are and you can make improvements to your code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is ever evolving and it becomes more advanced each day. Without updating your code, you don't give yourself the opportunity to use this new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tech world, there is always a way to improve a product. Customers give feedback on how they use your product and how they would like to use it in the future. Product managers take the feedback and prioritize features to start working on. It allows us to make our code more valuable and potentially increase profit in the future. By adding these features, customers are more willing to recommend your product to others increasing profit even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know why git is important and how it allows you to control your versions, how do you use it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a new branch in the terminal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git branch&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to see the current branch you are using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch &amp;lt;new-branch-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a new branch off of the one you are currently using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to checkout the new branch you created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also switch branches using &lt;code&gt;git switch &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you've created a new branch, you can start adding new code or update code that you've already written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, make sure that you are git committing your new code with messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git commit -m "Message Here&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've pushed to your new branch, you can merge to the main branch. Make sure that it is working code FIRST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can merge to main by making a pull request. On your github page you can select pull-request and make a new pull request by following the steps in the gif below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hwZStioM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sxh3nzoz8dvteixhmyfm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hwZStioM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sxh3nzoz8dvteixhmyfm.png" alt="Pull Request from Git" width="880" height="519"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HifHaXLR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jjuislpnmdlns5qlip70.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HifHaXLR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jjuislpnmdlns5qlip70.png" alt="Go to Pull Request Page" width="880" height="519"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UDqzA1AP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sv57mpabe871iauzaxpv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UDqzA1AP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sv57mpabe871iauzaxpv.png" alt="Create Pull Request" width="880" height="519"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing this, you can merge the pull request into your main branch for production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you've merged into main what do you do with the code in visual studio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pull!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch to main by &lt;code&gt;git switch main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pull&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the active code in main branch and you can start the process all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this guide will allow you to reduce mistakes that will create outages and bugs. It will also teach you important skills for a job. Many job postings require knowledge of git and it is important for them to have developers that won't cause setbacks or outages. They want to know that you will be able to help them with their main goal of delivering high quality products to their customers as fast as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatic authorization in Postman</title>
      <author>Iacovos Constantinou</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:04:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/iacons/automatic-authorization-in-postman-34dk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/iacons/automatic-authorization-in-postman-34dk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with short lived JWTs can be painful when you don't have an automated mechanism in place to refresh the token. This is quite common when setting up a new collection in Postman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we will be looking on how we can automate this, so that we retrieve, refresh and use the token right before each API call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#environment-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Environment configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, we need to define a few environment variables in Postman. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;baseUrl&lt;/code&gt; API URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; The username to connect with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt; The password for the above username&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there's no way to display the password as a ... password field. Postman will store and display everything in clear text, so have that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequest-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pre-request script
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we need to edit the collection and configure the Pre-request script code. To do that, right click on the collection, select edit and then "Pre-request scripts"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example. As you can see the implementation is quite generic so most likely you will need to adjust a few things to make that work for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag"&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-it-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How it works
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we check whether we have a token stored. If not we go ahead and retrieve a new one along with expiration time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We store both in environment variables. You don't need to create these variables, the script will create them whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the token exists, we check also whether it has expired.  In that case, we refresh the token and similarly to above we store the new token and its expiry date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the token will be stored in a new environment variable called &lt;code&gt;accessToken&lt;/code&gt;. This can be used to define the default authorization method. To do this right click on the collection, select edit, then Authorisation and use the variable &lt;code&gt;{{accessToken}}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this approach useful and hopefully it will save you from some time from manual actions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/cl4pper/created-my-own-react-boilerplate-i31</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good way to learn how some tech works is drilling it until you get inside. So I've decided to build my own react boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I'm using it only for personal projects, but I'm keen to share it and get some feedbacks from other devs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cl4pper-react-boilerplate.herokuapp.com/"&gt;App&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cl4pper/react-boilerplate"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel yourself free to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4 Reasons to Use Yugabyte Cloud to Build Cloud Native Applications</title>
      <author>Chirag Narang</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 17:19:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yugabyte/4-reasons-to-use-yugabyte-cloud-to-build-cloud-native-applications-37h4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yugabyte/4-reasons-to-use-yugabyte-cloud-to-build-cloud-native-applications-37h4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developers are using YugabyteDB for its PostgreSQL compatibility, linear scalability, resilience, and growing open source community. It has become the database of choice for organizations building cloud native applications that demand a highly scalable and resilient modern architecture. YugabyteDB is designed to run anywhere their cloud native applications run, across public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. However, developers don’t want to worry about the infrastructure, operations, and toil of typical DBA tasks. Plus, not all enterprises have the expertise and resources to oversee all the functions and understand the intricacies of running distributed databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yugabyte Cloud delivers the power of distributed SQL with the ease of use of a cloud database service. Developers can create and connect to an infinitely scalable, resilient PostgreSQL and Cassandra compatible database in minutes with zero operational overhead. It makes running YugabyteDB effortless in the public cloud, whether you’re building a new application or running a system-of-record that serves millions of transactions per day with several terabytes of data under management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers expect easy and on-demand access to a cloud native database. In this post, we reveal four key reasons to use this DBaaS offering of YugabyteDB to build cloud native applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-instantly-productive-with-a-simple-intuitive-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get Instantly Productive with a Simple Intuitive Design
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Yugabyte Cloud, developers are instantly productive building great applications while leaving day-to-day database operations to Yugabyte. In addition to industry-standard APIs, the service applies best practices to manage your infrastructure and database securely, offering capabilities such as daily backups, non-disruptive software upgrades, continuous availability, database usage monitoring, logging, auditing, identity and access management, data encryption, and key rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a few simple clicks, you get a distributed database in the cloud provider and region of your choice, provisioned appropriately for your application’s needs. You don’t have to worry about manual sharding, backups, upgrades, and monitoring. Yugabyte Cloud takes care of hardware failures automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-globally-in-any-of-the-leading-public-clouds"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploy Globally in Any of the Leading Public Clouds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yugabyte Cloud abstracts away the underlying cloud complexities, giving developers the freedom to build a cloud-agnostic operational model and manage a database across different cloud providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can deploy Yugabyte Cloud globally to over 30 regions supported by your preferred cloud provider. This helps you reduce latency, improve resilience, and comply with critical data residency regulations. Developers want to move faster, not be slowed down with the worry of cloud vendor lock-in and the burden of a complex migration process. Yugabyte Cloud is currently available for production on AWS and GCP, and will soon support Azure deployments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-confidently-with-security-by-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Confidently with Security by Design
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data loss, theft, and privacy often top the list of data concerns for organizations, particularly in security-sensitive and regulated industries. When companies contemplate cloud adoption, they correctly focus on the negative impacts these can have. Built with security-by-design principles, Yugabyte Cloud enforces security best practices, regardless of which cloud providers and regions developers choose to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yugabyte Cloud protects your clusters and cloud infrastructure by automatically employing highly-secure encryption in transit and encryption at rest. Yugabyte Cloud also provides DDoS and application-layer protection by automatically defending network protocol and volumetric DDoS attacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For network isolation, Yugabyte Cloud allows dedicated VPCs and IP allowlists for accepting connections from trusted IP addresses only. Additional features such as identity and access management, database access logging, auditing, and role-based access control ensure developers get best-in-class data security via intuitive admin controls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choose-from-a-variety-of-flexible-pricing-options"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choose from a Variety of Flexible Pricing Options
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yugabyte Cloud’s pricing is straightforward, based on the number of vCPUs and amount of data storage, both of which can be scaled separately as needed. Developers can choose between pay-as-you-go pricing and an annual subscription option. To make it even more effortless to get started, Yugabyte offers a perpetual free tier of Yugabyte Cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yugabyte Cloud is an easy way for developers to get started with a distributed SQL database. Now you can ensure continuous availability and limitless scale of your cloud native applications, while leaving database operations to Yugabyte.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Help us understand how you use Open Source Puppet</title>
      <author>Ben Ford</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 17:13:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/puppet/help-us-understand-how-you-use-open-source-puppet-51aj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/puppet/help-us-understand-how-you-use-open-source-puppet-51aj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The core of Puppet is an open source story. In the years that Puppet has existed — first as a project that Luke built a consultancy around, and then later as the core of our product as Reductive Labs evolved into Puppet Labs and then Puppet, Inc. — we have relied on the vision and expertise of our open source community. It’s a symbiotic relationship and the very definition of an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, Puppet was built by practitioners for practitioners. Our pain points were your pain points because you were right there in the trenches with us. Many core features, like &lt;a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1072"&gt;PUP-1072&lt;/a&gt;, were originally contributed by community members solving their own problems. And as we grew, your bug reports and feature requests guided our development trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we'd like to ask for some product roadmap feedback. If you’re using Open Source Puppet (OSP), please take a few minutes to respond to our brief survey and make your voice heard. We want to hear from you about how you’re using it, which features you focus on, the breadth and depth of your usage, and much more. Understanding your needs and implementation enables us to build the best possible roadmap for the future of Puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each survey response, Puppet will donate $1 to &lt;a href="https://voxpupuli.org/"&gt;Vox Pupuli&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="https://www.spi-inc.org"&gt;Software in the Public Interest (SPI)&lt;/a&gt;. Plus you can opt in to a raffle to win a new Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey takes less than 15 minutes to complete. This research is being conducted by an independent research firm for internal use only. All responses will remain anonymous, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the &lt;a href="https://clearpathstrategies.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_71WebwzdacZtYjA"&gt;Open Source Puppet user survey&lt;/a&gt; by Friday, 19 November, 2021, at midnight PT.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people have seen them, those immensely long import paths like the example below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../../../../modules/module.ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To improve this, you can use import aliases and make it look like the example&lt;br&gt;
below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@/modules/module.ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this is readability and that you can move files and folders to sub or parent directories without changing the import paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like Vue CLI are supporting this out-of-the-box, but if you want to use the new blazing-fast build tool Vite, you'll need to &lt;em&gt;(at the time of writing)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
configure it manually. I've included TypeScript and Jest because they are often used in combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this to work, all tools need to know that import aliases are used by modifying each tool's configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vite has a configuration file called &lt;code&gt;vite.config.ts&lt;/code&gt; and by adding the &lt;code&gt;resolve&lt;/code&gt; object Vite will know that import aliases are being used:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// vite.config.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;vite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By adding a &lt;code&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; object to the &lt;code&gt;compilerOptions&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; like the example below TypeScript will also know that import aliases are being used:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"compilerOptions"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"paths"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"@/*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"./src"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At last Jest knows that aliasses are being used by adding the &lt;code&gt;moduleNameMapper&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;jest.config.ts&lt;/code&gt; configuration file like the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// jest.config.ts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kr"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;moduleNameMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;^@/(.*)$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;rootDir&amp;gt;/src/$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling All Developers!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So very recently, a small crew of some very talented Devs and I put together a little project called P-PL.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This platform is designed for code experts and experienced/seasoned programmers to be able to sell their expertise and time to others that are seeking knowledge within that code base. Currently, at launch we are focusing heavily on two languages:&lt;br&gt;
-JavaScript&lt;br&gt;
-Python&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're great at slinging code and would like to freelance some of your time, at your own convenience, P-PL.com is the site for you! Help others solve their code issues, or tutor someone looking to learn. We are looking to onboard as many seasoned coders as possible, so please feel free to share our content within your circles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our socials: @p_pl_talk on Instagram and Twitter. Search 'P-PL' on Youtube for a 5 minute rundown tutorial of our super easy-to-use webapp.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign up, give yourself a title, a brief description about yourself, and choose the code/tech categories you're interested in. Give yourself an avatar, and you're rockin' 'n rollin'!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the best experience, we ask that you access the platform from a Desktop Machine or Laptop, and utilize a browser like Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;
