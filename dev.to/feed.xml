      <description>&lt;p&gt;🎥 Here is a "quick and dirty" video tutorial showing how to install and config Pyluos to use Luos with Python. 🎓 Luos is an open-source project working on "how to bring &lt;strong&gt;modularity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; to embedded systems", like @SpaceX, @Tesla, or @Dyson does.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Failed With My Recent SaaS Product</title>
      <author>Sunil Kumar</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 09:56:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sunilc_/how-i-failed-with-my-recent-saas-product-3f27</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sunilc_/how-i-failed-with-my-recent-saas-product-3f27</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was introduced to programming, I fell in love with it. The idea of changing the world just by sitting in a room in a corner of the world fascinated me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always loved to work on side projects. I loved building products to solve own problems I faced every day. At any point, I always had a side project I was excited to work on. I did this for many years but I never shared it with anyone except for a few close friends of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept working on many side projects over the years. I even put them proudly on my resume. But I never really built something which was solving an actual problem. I did this for years. I built products that were fun to work on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, these are some of the products I built:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Linux desktop alarm manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track courier app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github contribution enhancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Hunt CLI etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see all these are fun products to build but they aren't solving an actual real-world problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I came across the concept of micro saas products and bootstrapped companies. If you're a SaaS enthusiast but don't think can build a typical startup, you should check out what micro SaaS startups are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, you build a small SaaS product that solves a very niche problem and earn tens of thousands of dollars (or a hell lot more if it goes well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goals behind a Mirco startup are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solving a small but a real problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working on products you love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still making a lot of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;freedom from working for someone else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;staying small (typically 1-5 people)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#story-of-landr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Story of Landr:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic hit the world in 2020 I had plenty of time at my disposal. So I decided to work on that "one cool idea" I had for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to make "yet another website builder". But I decided to solve this problem a little differently. Even though many drag and drop tools were available for nontechnical people to build websites, I thought people still needed to have great design skills to develop a good website using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I built a simpler tool that involved taking user inputs through a series of forms and generate websites from a user-selected template available on the tool. I named it &lt;a href="https://landr.page"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can input details like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;product features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pricing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;newsletter details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embed video links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;images etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this was a cool idea to build. End users can just enter some inputs and click on the Generate button and create a website for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the slightest knowledge of building SaaS products you would have figured out my mistakes by now, which are many!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not generally how you build SaaS products, especially when your goal is to build a successful SaaS product generating thousands of dollars of income per month. You need to follow the right approach which generally involves doing the below steps in order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate Idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build MVP product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get user feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add additional features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market it more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see I didn't do any of the critical steps before starting to code the product. Doing market research is very important to understand which market has the potential to get into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideation is important to understand the real problems that people have. Once you confirm there exists a demand for a product solving a particular problem and people are ready to pay if such a product exists, only then you should go ahead and start building the MVP version of your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I skipped all these critical steps and jumped right into coding the "cool idea" I had. If you want to learn how to build a successful SaaS business online, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://sunilkumarc.gumroad.com/l/kgtSS"&gt;eBook&lt;/a&gt; that we released recently which I co-wrote along with my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent months building the complete product end to end all by myself. I was the only one who was deciding what features should be present in the product without any user involvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was motivated to complete the project and I did put a lot of heart into it. I was able to complete it in 2 months along with my day job at a startup. Another mistake. This is another mistake. You should not be spending 2 months of your time without showing the minimal product to the end-users and getting feedback to improve on it. There is a famous quote by Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, which really resonates with some entrepreneurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I loved the effort I had put in and how the product turned out in the end. I made a checklist of different things to take care of for the launch on Product Hunt and on Twitter. I even made a launch video myself. I have never edited videos before. But I was committed enough to giving it all I had for the launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch in fact did go well and it achieved &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/landr-3/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#5 Product of the Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The launch went well in terms of upvotes and likes. I didn't make a single sale. I wasn't aware of how SaaS products are actually built during this time. More importantly, I didn't know how to market the product I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to DM people on Twitter, got involved in Facebook group discussions, and tried to spread the word about my product. But nobody was ready to pay for the product. I tried hard for a couple of months more before I finally abandoned the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I researched and talked to more people in the SaaS space after this, I realized my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look back I don't regret spending months of hard work on this product. At the end of the day, I learned something new and I did build a product I had in mind, which made me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Ruby Used For?</title>
      <author>Jjyygh</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 09:56:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jjyygh/what-is-ruby-used-for-5bi5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jjyygh/what-is-ruby-used-for-5bi5</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Uses Of Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby is mainly designed or follow the principle of least astonishment (POLA). Its main idea is to reduce the complexity of use for users. While developing programmers can enjoy the programming in Ruby. Ruby has come up with great features like support to an object-oriented language, inheritance, garbage collection, dynamic and duck typing, overloading, exception handling, built-in support, support to all major platforms, compatible with other languages, and scope of variables, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ruby&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby is an open-source programming language. It is also referred to as scripting language that is dynamic, interpreted and object-oriented as well. It was created and developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the year 1993. It was first released or appeared in 1995. It supports cross-platform operating systems. It was written in C language.  Ruby has a syntax that is mainly similar to Perl and Python. It is scalable and projects with large code are easily maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Get a 100k Flux grant for deploying your app on the Flux network</title>
      <author>Cryptovium </author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 09:54:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cryptovium/get-a-flux-grant-for-deploying-your-app-on-the-flux-network-2nbh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cryptovium/get-a-flux-grant-for-deploying-your-app-on-the-flux-network-2nbh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RquakokX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ho3jncxtavfutx0zx7u7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RquakokX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ho3jncxtavfutx0zx7u7.png" alt="Flux - your gateway to a decentralized world"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flux has opened up applications for developers to get a &lt;strong&gt;100,000 Flux&lt;/strong&gt; (~$10,000 at time of writing) grant for creating and deploying something awesome on the Flux network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've got the ideas, skills and motivation to build something truly unique, then Flux's decentrealized cloud network is the place to build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-flux"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Flux?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flux is a powerful global decentralized computing network currently made up of over &lt;strong&gt;1650 community-run, decentralized nodes&lt;/strong&gt; powered by the revolutionary second layer operating system: FluxOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCqHOBRuSmI"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each node is capable of hosting dockerized applications with FluxOS ensuring that a set number of containers are run across the network. This ensures true decentralization and that your app is always available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flux Network currently has close to 10,000 vCores, 30TB RAM and 1,000TB of SSD storage available for apps to consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powering the ecosystem is the Flux blockchain, a Proof of Work chain that is used for rewarding miners and node operators, payment for compute resources and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apps-already-on-the-flux-network"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Apps already on the Flux Network
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flux network already hosts dozens of apps and aspects of blockchain infrastructure for other projects. Flux can run any hardened dockerized image, so the possibilities of what you can build are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They recently completed a 20 dapps in 20 days challenge which 20 new apps added to the network, including numerous games. In fact, Flux is perfect for hosting online games and even has some Minecraft servers currently running on the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Flux also hosts aspects of other Crypto projects infrastructure, the best example of which is Kadena. There are hundreds of Kadena nodes currently being run on the Flux Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see a complete list of apps running on Flux, check out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.runonflux.io/fluxos#dapps-section"&gt;https://www.runonflux.io/fluxos#dapps-section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#100k-flux-grants"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  100k Flux grants
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the ball rolling after the 20 dapps in 20 days challenge, Flux is looking for the next killer decentralized application and is inviting developers to submit their ideas to be in with a chance of getting one of those 100k $FLUX grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a single app, a platform/system consisting of a combination of apps or something else entirely as long as it harnesses the strengths of a decentralized cloud and helps to grow the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grants are give for the development proposals that are greenlighted by the community DAO and are paid in phases at key project milestones with the final amount paid on the final production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-apply"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to apply
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details on how to apply and what winning the grant will mean, please check out the following post from the Flux team:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to learn more about the Flux project as a whole, then checkout the &lt;a href="https://runonflux.io"&gt;Flux website&lt;/a&gt;, drop by the &lt;a href="https://discord.io/runonflux"&gt;Flux discord&lt;/a&gt; or give them a follow on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RunOnFlux"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also cover Flux and other projects extensively on my own &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cryptovium"&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, including weekly updates on the earning potential of running a Flux node.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Observer Design Pattern in JavaScript</title>
      <author>Shubham Khatri</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 09:46:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shubhamreacts/observer-design-pattern-in-javascript-74m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shubhamreacts/observer-design-pattern-in-javascript-74m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working with any language, we tend to use several reusable design solutions to commonly occurring problems. In JavaScript, too, we have a mix of well-defined patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Observer pattern is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we shall understand more about the Observer design pattern in JavaScript and implement a small example in vanilla JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-observer-design-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Is the Observer Design Pattern?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Observer pattern follows a subscription model. A subscriber (commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) subscribes to an event or an action handled by a publisher (commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) is notified when the event or action occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject broadcasts the occurrence of the event or action to all the observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the observer no longer wishes to be notified of the changes by the subject, it unsubscribes itself from the subject, and the subject then removes it from the list of subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Observer design pattern is very similar to a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher/Subscriber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pattern, with a small difference that a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher/Subscriber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; pattern also specifies a topic it wants to subscribe to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when detecting keyboard shortcuts, the subscriber can choose to specify a key combination that it wants to listen to in a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher/Subscriber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; model.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation-of-the-observer-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation of the Observer Pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of the Observer pattern, we will go about implementing a simple interaction where multiple elements listen to the mouse position on the screen and perform different actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of what our interaction looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z087sScn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628501304147/iFGHMMHk4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z087sScn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628501304147/iFGHMMHk4.gif" alt="Demo interaction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we implement this interaction, let us analyze what is happening in this example as the mouse position changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse position is immediately updated in the textbox at the top right corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circle follows the trajectory of the mouse after a delay of 1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above description, we see that multiple components need information about the same thing but behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above example, we identify that the &lt;strong&gt;subject&lt;/strong&gt; listens to the mouse event on the window and relays it to whoever wants it. The &lt;strong&gt;circle and textbox&lt;/strong&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;observers&lt;/strong&gt; in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let us now go ahead and implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-implement-a-mousepositionobservable-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1. Implement a MousePositionObservable class
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step let us go ahead and implement the &lt;code&gt;MousePositionObservable&lt;/code&gt; class. This class needs to do the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a list of observer callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expose a &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt; method which the observers will call to subscribe to the change. The return value of this must be a function that will move the &lt;code&gt;callback&lt;/code&gt; from the set of &lt;code&gt;subscriptions&lt;/code&gt; when called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to &lt;code&gt;mouseMove&lt;/code&gt; event and trigger all subscription callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code looks like the below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MousePositionObservable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscriptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mousemove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMouseMove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleMouseMove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscriptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscriptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-create-html-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2. Create HTML elements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now create our HTML elements for &lt;code&gt;circle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;textMessageBox&lt;/code&gt; and add styles to them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"circle"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mouse-position"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mouse Position&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"position"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#f3df49&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#238643&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;25px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.mouse-position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.mouse-position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-add-observers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3. Add observers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step to make it come together is to create an instance of our &lt;code&gt;MousePositionObservable&lt;/code&gt; class and add observers to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that we shall invoke the &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt; method on the class instance and pass on a callback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our code looks like the below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mousePositionObservable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MousePositionObservable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mousePositionObservable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nx"&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`translate(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;px, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;px)`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Update the mouse positon container to show the mouse position values&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mousePositionObservable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;board&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.mouse-position .position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;ClientX: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;ClientY: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  `&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We add two subscriptions to the &lt;code&gt;MousePositionObservable&lt;/code&gt; instance, one for each element that needs to listen to mouse values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subscription callback for the &lt;code&gt;circle&lt;/code&gt; element gets the reference of the DOM element and updates its &lt;code&gt;transform&lt;/code&gt; property. The transform property will use hardware acceleration where possible, so using &lt;code&gt;translate()&lt;/code&gt; over position top and left will see performance benefits if any animations or transitions are also being used on the element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subscription callback for the &lt;code&gt;textbox&lt;/code&gt; element updates its HTML content by using the &lt;code&gt;innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: When you want to unsubscribe the listener, all you have to do is to store the returned value from the subscribe function call and invoke it like a function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all we need for our demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the working example in the Codepen below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/mayank_shubham/embed/OJpjraX?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-observer-design-pattern"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and Disadvantages of the Observer Design Pattern
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Observer design pattern provides us the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is extremely useful when we want to perform multiple actions on a single event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides a way to decouple functionalities while maintaining consistency between related objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of this pattern stems from its benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the Observer design pattern leads to loosely coupled code, it is sometimes hard to guarantee that other parts of the application are working as they should. For example, the subscriptions added to the subject may have code that is behaving incorrectly, but there is no way for the publisher to know that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#realworld-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Real-World Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working with web development we see that &lt;code&gt;Redux&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;React Context&lt;/code&gt; are both examples of implementations built upon the Observer Design Pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Redux, we have a &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt; method that allows us to add observers to the redux state which acts as the subject. Whoever subscribes to the redux store is notified when any change is made to the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, with React Context whenever the value is updated for the &lt;code&gt;ContextProvider&lt;/code&gt;, all components that subscribe to the Context either through the &lt;code&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; hook or through &lt;code&gt;Context.Consumer&lt;/code&gt; are re-rendered with updated context values.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we went through the Observer design pattern and how to use it within our application. We also implement a demo based on this pattern and learned about some of the advantages and disadvantages of following this approach to designing interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>strip.pysondb a new JSON DB for python</title>
      <author>Adwaith Rajesh</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 09:33:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/adwaithrajesh/strip-pysondb-a-new-json-db-for-python-2c75</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adwaithrajesh/strip-pysondb-a-new-json-db-for-python-2c75</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we will be talking about &lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb"&gt;strip.pysondb&lt;/a&gt;, as the name suggest it's stripped down version of an existing JSON DB called &lt;a href="https://dev.to/fredysomy/pysondb-a-json-based-lightweight-database-for-python-ija"&gt;pysondb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will discuss some issues with pysondb and how the strip.pysondb fixes those issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, some of the core features of strip.pysondb are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No third party packages needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No ImageUtils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names"&gt;python naming conventions&lt;/a&gt; in functions and classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just the code required to perform CRUD operation on JSON DB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can generate custom id's for their&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though its called a stripped-down version of the original. There are some huge differences in the strip.pysondb works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data is not saved to file instantly, instead a methods needs to be called in order to do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user is supposed to pass the keys / column name for the DB during initialization of the &lt;code&gt;DB&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the new methods that are not derived from PysonDB are,

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#dbpop_id-str---dictstr-any--none"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#saving-to-a-file"&gt;&lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#load-values-from-a-file"&gt;&lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#get-the-first-n-values-from-the-db"&gt;&lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#using-a-custom-id-generator"&gt;&lt;code&gt;set_id_generator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb/blob/master/docs/docs.md#check-whether-an-id-exists-in-the-db"&gt;&lt;code&gt;id_exists&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-talk-about-speed"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's talk about speed
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample code that continuously add 1000 values to the DB, and calculates the time it takes to add all the 1000 values&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pysonDB
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  pip3 install pysondb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# test.py
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pysondb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"test.json"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;t2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ py test.py
  7.166365623474121
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep, it takes 8 seconds to add 1000 values. If the DB already has a 1000 values then it takes 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strip.pysondb
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  pip3 install strip.pysondb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# test2.py
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pysondb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"age"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;commit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"test2.json"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;t2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ py test2.py
  0.009546756744384
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see it only takes 0.01 seconds to add 1000 values. It only takes 0.9 seconds to 100_000 values to the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/strip.pysondb"&gt;Click here to see the GItHub Repo and for more info on the usage of strip.pysondb&lt;/a&gt; Star it if you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you want to use a DB in your projects choose wisely and research all the available options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Considerations in Building Enclaves for Multiparty Computation (Part 2)</title>
      <author>Jack F.</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 09:21:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/oblivious/considerations-in-building-enclaves-for-multiparty-computation-part-2-2pcn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/oblivious/considerations-in-building-enclaves-for-multiparty-computation-part-2-2pcn</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-your-code-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Your Code On
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve pinned down the ideal functionality of the enclave, and assuming you are comfortable coding up a server to handle requests from each party, we can talk about some of the aspects you probably want to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In AWS, you can treat Nitro Enclaves as a self-contained VM with an Enclave Image File build from a Docker image running inside. The communication in and out of the enclave is via virtual sockets (vsock) only to the parent instance (that is the instance that created the enclave. The parent instance acts as an intermediary between the enclave and the outside world, with the sole exception of the KMS Proxy which speaks directly with AWS Key Management Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, the purpose of using a trusted execution environment is because the parties don’t trust each other. So we have to assume the users of the enclave are adversarial by nature. This means there is an onus on you, the developer, to develop a secure application which is often easier said than done. A good starting point is to create strict input and output validators. If the IO is forced to conform to a predefined JSON-schema or OpenAPI definition, at least you should be able to validate that while checking for any malicious characters and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should endeavor to be particularly careful when handling bytes as an input, especially in Python. The YouTuber PwnFunction has a nice introductory tutorial on a known exploit in Python’s Pickle library which you can find here.&lt;br&gt;
There is an ever persisting battle of course between usability and security. Some would strongly argue that enclave source code should be in either C or Rust, while others feel comfortable using languages such as Python in order to take advantage of a particular tool or framework within the enclave itself. Irrespective of your decision, the code can be made more secure by performing rigorous testing, performing static analysis such as SonarCloud, and using internal firewalls to lock down any unexpected communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‌Once you’ve hardened the IO of the enclave you may also want to consider your authentication model for within the enclave. This can be as simple as inputting the key management services the enclave can speak to as a build argument (discusses in the next section) or using pre-shared keys with TLS-PSK for example. OAuth-based approaches may cause some additional considerations if the enclave can not directly communicate with a trusted key authority for public-key cryptographic approaches. That’s not to say it’s impossible, but one should certainly think through the challenges and potential risks which may be involved if there is a parent server acting as a man-in-the-middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encoding-guarantees-build-arguments-and-environment-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encoding Guarantees: Build Arguments and Environment Variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously we established that the enclave image (converted from the Docker image) running inside the Nitro Enclave is what is attested when requesting key access from one or more of the parties. Well, we can use this fact to develop reusable enclave images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2XRlt59R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9kkfmfeymrxaynwn911.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2XRlt59R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9kkfmfeymrxaynwn911.png" alt="Enclave Build Pipeline"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, assume that we have two parties, Alice and Bob. They would like to be authorised based on some hash of their respective KMS ARNs and would also like to limit the number of function calls made by Alice to 3 and Bob to 2. Now imagine another scenario where Alice and Charlie would like to run the same interaction, but this time Alice can only make 2 function calls and Charlie 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a scenario you do not want to be hard coding this information each time. Instead, you can leverage Docker build arguments and set them as environment variables within the enclave. This changes the Docker image and as such the attestation hashes that are used to verify the container to the key management services. It also can be highly efficient too, depending on how you create your Docker image as it can take advantage of build caching such that building the image with new arguments can be a painless process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#persistent-storage-pci-devices-amp-resource-requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Persistent Storage, PCI Devices &amp;amp; Resource Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nitro Enclaves endeavor to ensure security by locking down a virtual machine to a very limited set of functionalities. It operates purely in RAM with dedicated CPUs. As such many functionalities, you may expect may not be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one would typically expect to have persistent storage on a Volume on an EC2 instance. However, this of course is outside of the enclave so you have to encrypt data using a KMS before releasing it to the parent instance. In the context of multiparty computation, this poses an interesting question, whose keys to use? To answer this you may wish to consider who manages the parent instance and how many of the parties would need to collaborate together to decrypt the data if the encrypted payload was to ever be leaked. One approach would be to encrypt the packet with each party's KMS in turn and reverse the process when decrypting the payload if returned to the enclave at a later point. There is nothing obviously wrong with this approach, but as we no every encryption and decryption will add to the latency of the enclave overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to data, we’ve found it's best to assume the enclave is transactional and to save and reload persistent data for better confidence. That is not to say you shouldn’t save anything locally but best to consider it as a cache. That way if the enclave were to halt and be restored you have the safety net of being able to reload the state of the enclave.&lt;br&gt;
A second challenge is that no PCI devices are available to the enclave, so if you are hoping to crunch some data on a GPA or equivalent, you may want to think again. Your only obvious solution in such a scenario is to pay for an instance with more powerful CPUs and/or to allocate more of them to the enclave to facilitate threading and multiprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one must remember that the entire enclave lives within the permitted resources at launch time. This means the enclave must have enough ram for the enclave image, all RAM required internally, and all RAM which will store the file system and so forth. This is worth keeping in mind as you develop your enclave and taking a resource-efficient design can save you significantly on your monthly AWS bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#timing-attacks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Timing Attacks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, enclaves give you a guarantee that what code you agree gets run, not that it is safe to run. This is a big difference and the onus is on the developer to make sure that side channels, such as execution time, do not leak sensitive information that was unforeseen when signing off on the ideal functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gk3doYdD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5o3ayolyqhzhvwlikxm4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gk3doYdD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5o3ayolyqhzhvwlikxm4.png" alt="Timing Attacs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at how the timing of execution may inadvertently change the guessing probability of a party's secret input. Suppose Alice inputs a decision tree that Bob wishes to use to classify some data. If the decision tree is not balanced, ie if there is a different number of comparisons required depending on the path taken through the branches of the decision tree, then simple timing of the execution time may reveal what the output of the classification was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not always trivial to achieve, you should endeavor to create fixed-time programs for enclaves if the timing is likely to reveal superfluous information to one or more parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not delving into actual code, we’ve tried to outline some pointers towards building your first few enclaves. Even the pros can make a mistake with a poorly defined ideal functionality or an insecure implementation. Take your time, give it a shot and be comfortable to make some mistakes initially. Enclave technology is still very new and there is great reward in being an early pioneer in developing and leveraging enclave applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-oblivious%E2%80%8C"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Oblivious?‌
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Oblivious, we’ve built the first full-service enclave management system for multiparty applications. It’s called Ignite and it allows data scientists and machine learning practitioners to take advantage of prebuilt enclaves for data exploration, analysis, training, and inference.

      <title>Top Prime reasons why to adapt SMS Drip Campaign Plugin for Business</title>

&lt;p&gt;Superfine benefits of Email Drip Campaign to manage your business&lt;br&gt;
After getting aware of “What is an email drip campaign” and the types of it, let’s find out how it can help us more in our day-to-day activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--73WpzHPg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/f_jpg%2Cq_auto%2Cw_720/610cc6fae87e7a001db58350.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--73WpzHPg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/f_jpg%2Cq_auto%2Cw_720/610cc6fae87e7a001db58350.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You set the interval that doesn’t mean it shares false information to tarnish your business brand. The key role of this platform is to present the right information to the correct lead. It already focused on user interaction, stage of the sales cycle, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business will get maximum benefit like sending email on time, getting sales at the right time, and more importantly, everything will be done with less effort. Sending email with a set interval means customers feel like you want to get engaged with them and this is the plus point for your business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the assistance of a drip campaign for your business, a user can send segmented email to their potential leads or to a new customer who purchased something from you. It is to remind them that you still have the opportunity to explore more and get the best product to cater to your needs. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started my career, I was always afraid of losing my code changes. Sometimes, I would copy the code to text files just to be sure that I won't miss something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not a great practice. If you know how to use git properly, you won't have these doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git has everything you need to make you safe. And much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Started with SQLAlchemy for Database Operations In Python </title>
      <author>Mwenda Harun Mbaabu</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/grayhat/getting-started-with-sqlalchemy-for-database-operations-in-python-5b5p</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sqlalchemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfnBP6H5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v59cyq01vls0v1dq89em.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QfnBP6H5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v59cyq01vls0v1dq89em.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper(ORM) for Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It facilitates communication between Python programs and databases. Most of the time, this library is used as an ORM tool.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/strong&gt; offers several benefits over the raw SQL approach, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1). Cleaner code:&lt;/strong&gt; Having SQL code as Python strings gets messy pretty quickly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2). More secure code:&lt;/strong&gt; Using SQLAlchemy's ORM functionalities can help mitigate against vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3). Simpler logic:&lt;/strong&gt; SQLAlchemy allows us to abstract all of our database logic into Python objects. Instead of having to think on a table, row, and column level, we can consider everything on a class, instance, and attribute level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLAlchemy is best understood by thinking of it as two distinct components, SQLAlchemy Core and SQLAlchemy ORM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter is built on top of the former, but you can use either component exclusively to build your application, depending on which level of abstraction you prefer. Let's take a quick look at some comparable insert statements, using raw SQL, the SQLAlchemy Expression Language, and the SQLAlchemy ORM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-orm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What is ORM?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORM is a programming technique for representing database records as corresponding objects in programming languages. Therefore, we could interact and perform operations on those database records as if we are dealing with objects.&lt;br&gt;
ORM gives us the power to turn database records into objects, making database interactions and modifications as effortless as handling objects in programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g0WkJv3Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4x9qb33gb6oaarbhn3i7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--g0WkJv3Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4x9qb33gb6oaarbhn3i7.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros and Cons of ORM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pros"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conciseness,&lt;/strong&gt; ORM allows users to use programming languages of their choice with more concise and simple syntax than using raw SQL queries, reducing the amount of code needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimal,&lt;/strong&gt; ORM also enables users to take advantage of the optimization of Object-Oriented Programmings such as inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction by representing database records as objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility,&lt;/strong&gt; With ORM, users can easily switch between different database management systems (MySQL, Sqlite3, PostgreSQL,…) without having to possess a sound understanding of these systems as well as SQL language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time,&lt;/strong&gt; Because ORMs are frameworks, users would have to spend time learning and familiarizing themselves with these tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less control,&lt;/strong&gt; Using ORM, users will have less control and initiative with databases.&lt;br&gt;
Let’s learn how to use SQLAlchemy, a fairly well-known ORM for the Python programming language, and see how this tool could help you save a significant amount of time and effort when working with the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create_engine&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pymysql&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"all imported"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error in importing"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#engine-configuration-in-sqlalchemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Engine Configuration In SQLAlchemy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SQLAlchemy documentation: &lt;strong&gt;The Engine is the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s “home base” for the actual database and its &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/"&gt;DBAPI&lt;/a&gt; delivered to the SQLAlchemy application through a connection pool and a Dialect, which describes how to talk to a specific kind of database/DBAPI combination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general structure can be illustrated as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QPJsRZr---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qw1p101xqe3e0yy0aha2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QPJsRZr---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qw1p101xqe3e0yy0aha2.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where above, an Engine references both a Dialect and a Pool, which together interpret the DBAPI’s module functions as well as the behavior of the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an engine is just a matter of issuing a single call, create_engine(). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The API dialect of the database we are using is passed in create_engine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sqlite"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;SQLite&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLite connects to file-based databases, using the Python built-in module sqlite3 by default. As SQLite connects to local files, the URL format is slightly different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “file” portion of the URL is the filename of the database. For a relative file path, this requires three slashes. The three slashes are followed by the absolute path:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;create_engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqlite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get-started-and-connect-to-my-mysql-database-"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dialect+driver : mysql+pymysql&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create_engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'mysql+pymysql://root:shelvi31@127.0.0.1/errors?host=localhost?port=3306'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;table_names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFLECTION:&lt;/strong&gt; reads the database and builds SQLAlchemy Table Objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLAlchemy can be used to automatically load tables from a database using something called reflection. Reflection is the process of reading the database and building the metadata based on that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importing metadata and table needed for reflection. MetaData is an object is a catalog that stores DB information such as a table, such that we don't need to keep looking them up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sqlalchemy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MetaData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MetaData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Defining table object by giving name of table stores in db:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dummy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dummy"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;autoload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;autoload_with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#Using Function repr to view the details of the table that we stored as dummy:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;repr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dummy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Print only the column names
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dummy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the Engine and its underlying Pool do not establish the first actual DBAPI connection until the Engine.connect() method is called, or an operation which is dependent on this method such as Engine.execute() is invoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Querying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;connection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;resultset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fetchall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;resultset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn"&gt;Anchor&lt;/a&gt; is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that provides a savings account interface where users can deposit UST (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/terra-money/announcing-terrausd-ust-the-interchain-stablecoin-53eab0f8f0ac"&gt;Terra USD&lt;/a&gt;) and earn stable yield. With an average interest rate of ~20%, Anchor blows away traditional savings accounts by a mile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#anchors-stable-yield"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Anchor's Stable Yield
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how is Anchor able to maintain such a high stable interest yield for depositors? According to the &lt;a href="https://anchorprotocol.com/docs/anchor-v1.1.pdf"&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;, Anchor is a money market that is defined by deposits of bonded assets (bAssets, eg. &lt;a href="https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/protocol/bonded-assets-bassets/bonded-luna-bluna"&gt;bLUNA&lt;/a&gt;) that earns interest from borrowers. Borrowers put down bAssets as collateral to borrow UST from the lenders' pool. The staking rewards earned by bAssets are collected by the protocol and paid to lenders as interest accrued. Therefore, the interest rate is determined algorithmically as a function of the amount of lend UST that has been borrowed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#borrowers-incentives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Borrowers' Incentives
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a sound fiscal policy is essential, it is not enough to drive widespread adoption of the Anchor money market. To incentivize borrowers to take on risks to provide liquidity to the market, borrowers receive rewards in &lt;a href="https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/protocol/anchor-token-anc"&gt;ANC&lt;/a&gt;, Anchor's governance token. ANC rewards are set to exceed the cost of borrowing, therefore attracting a lot of borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ecosystem-breakdown"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ecosystem Breakdown
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of Anchor is like a lever, with the protocol at the pivot, lenders and borrowers are at the opposite sides. Either side is essential to maintaining the stability and liquidity of the market. Like every financial market, the rules of demand and supply applies to Anchor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lending-on-anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lending on Anchor
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply end of the market is characterized by lenders supplying UST to the lending pool. Lending on Anchor using the web interface involves a few steps. Before you access Anchor, you have to have a &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp?hl=en"&gt;Terra Station Wallet&lt;/a&gt;, and some UST to be deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to visit the Anchor &lt;a href="https://app.anchorprotocol.com/earn"&gt;earn page&lt;/a&gt;, where a dashboard on everything about lending is presented. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---lMLYg-0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/orkfnz1uuuynr09o5i8f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---lMLYg-0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/orkfnz1uuuynr09o5i8f.png" alt="Anchor earn page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, click on &lt;strong&gt;Deposit&lt;/strong&gt; to pop up the modal to begin the transaction flow. Enter the amount of UST you want to lend and click on &lt;strong&gt;Proceed&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cc5EklRs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1edhgcnymqz6h9kcwaz2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cc5EklRs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1edhgcnymqz6h9kcwaz2.png" alt="Deposit flow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Terra Station wallet will request your password to confirm the deposit. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_6BvqBPK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/63o8tkweam5q6w1tsjqj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_6BvqBPK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/63o8tkweam5q6w1tsjqj.png" alt="Deposit confirmation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; After successful deposit, you should see the deposit amount reflect on your dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#anchor-statistics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Anchor Statistics
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of every money market depends on how widely it is adopted. Adoption is also an indicator of the market's underlying utility because transaction volumes will tell whether there is enough supply and demand (liquidity) to make and maintain a market. Without liquidity, a market becomes stale and may lead to funds getting locked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the daily count of new users inflow into the Anchor protocol. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6e9hrXA2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ch3pwkjsxgsctm6dzopf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6e9hrXA2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ch3pwkjsxgsctm6dzopf.png" alt="New Anchor Users"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/462874ad-61cb-45f2-a0b0-06f86e3ae93a/14102b04-3fee-43fd-8920-a24a118f43b5"&gt;New Anchor Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New users are users that have their first recorded transaction against the Anchor protocol. We can see that new users to Anchor range from 100 - 500 daily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibit below shows the volume of bLUNA being locked up as collateral on a daily basis on Anchor. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NFzTUl0w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tpqz1xqvidmocw40akl7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NFzTUl0w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tpqz1xqvidmocw40akl7.png" alt="Daily Collateral"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/d89a8c14-4545-4843-8ac4-cbbfded1b3b0/10c4bd6c-1048-493e-8dff-4ccf8d5b3779"&gt;Anchor Daily Collateral Deposits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 14 days, we can see that collateral deposits peaked at 46.2 million bLUNA on July 23, 2021. Two days later, collateral deposits plunged to the lowest troughs under the period of assessment to 16.1 million bLUNA. However, deposits bounced back on July 26, 2021. Collateral deposits are expected to rise steadily amidst peaks and troughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next graph below presents a summary of the frequency of collateral deposits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oaOKpmL3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j923sl41ujubndrovejh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oaOKpmL3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j923sl41ujubndrovejh.png" alt="Deposit frequency"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/43df2d6e-a5ac-4c97-88f4-044ac96b9361/7e071202-6973-4557-bd6e-1aebd27b39e2"&gt;Anchor Deposit Count&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can infer from the graph that Anchor is getting consistent traction in terms of collateral deposits with an average daily count of 2,000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Findings &amp;amp; Conclusion
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have analysed Anchor, a decentralized savings protocol that lives atop the Terra blockchain. Anchor's main proposition is 20% yield on lending supply, and ANC rewards for borrowers which exceed costs of borrowing. Anchor then pays lenders with staking rewards generated from bAssets provided by borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also demonstrated how to access savings on Anchor using the Terra Station wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage statistics of the protocol showed that, an average of about 200 new accounts use the protocol daily. The protocol sees an average collateral deposit of 15,000 UST. Combined with a daily average deposit count of 2,000, we can project steady inflow of 30,000,000 UST in collateral deposits every day. This constant stream of deposits should be enough to generate rewards to pay lenders' 20% interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can conclude that Anchor's operations and fiscal policies are generally sound and the market is expected to experience steady growth in the months ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biggest Challenge in React application is the management of global state. In large applications, React alone is not sufficient to handle the state complexity which is why some developers use React hooks, Redux and others state management libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-you-need-a-state-management-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do You Need A State Management Library?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reasons of compatibility and simplicity, it's best to use React's built-in state management capabilities rather than external global state like Recoil. But as i said before React has certain limitations when it comes to a global state management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Component state can only be shared by pushing it up to the common ancestor, but this might include a huge tree that then needs to re-render.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context can only store a single value, not an indefinite set of values each with its own consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these make it difficult to code-split the top of the tree (where the state has to live) from the leaves of the tree (where the state is used).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-when-should-we-use-a-state-management-library-like-recoil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So When Should We Use A State Management Library Like Recoil?
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying a global state management is not so easy, it is a lot off hard work and it also takes time to implement. So, it is very important for you to know when to implement the state-management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your application contains a large number of components and a lot of requests are being sent to the back-end for data retrieval, then it becomes mandatory to implement the state-management, as it will boost the user experience and speed of the application to a great extent. With a global state, you don't have to fetch the same request multiple times as the data will already be "cached" from the first request and can be consumed by other part of your screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use redundant data throughout the whole app, for example, a list of customers is being used in the invoice creation and sales report generation then there is no need to fetch customers again and again from the database. You could simply just put the data in the global state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-it-about-recoiljs-thats-so-appealing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is it about Recoil.js that’s so appealing?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recoil feels just like React. The syntax is similar to React and it looks like a part of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/habilelabs/brahmos-js-a-new-frontend-ui-framework-with-react-like-api-8d1309b17de"&gt;React API&lt;/a&gt;. Other than that, it has many other upsides like it solves the problem of global state management, shared state, derived data, etc. The team at Recoil make sure that the semantics and behavior of Recoil be as Reactish as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-recoil-concept"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Recoil Concept.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recoil is an &lt;strong&gt;experimental&lt;/strong&gt; state management library at Facebook, created by Dave McCabe. The reason why i like Recoil better than Redux is because Recoil solves all our complex state management problems but its configuration is surprisingly simple, unlike Redux. And we do not need to write much boilerplate code as we would have by using other state management library like Redux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-recoil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing Recoil
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Recoil is a state management library for React, you need to make sure that you have React or React Native installed and running before getting started.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;recoil
// or
yarn add recoil
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#core-concept-of-recoil"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Core Concept of Recoil
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two core concepts of Recoil that you need to understand. This are Atoms and Selectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#atoms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Atoms
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atoms are units of state. They're updateable and subscribable: when an atom is updated, each subscribed component is re-rendered with the new value. They can be created at runtime, too. Atoms can be used in place of React local component state. If the same atom is used from multiple components, all those components share their state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create Atoms with the &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;countState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Atoms use a unique key for debugging, persistence, and mapping of all atoms. &lt;strong&gt;You can't have a duplicate key among the atoms&lt;/strong&gt;. So because of that you need to make sure they're globally unique. And also like a React component state, they also have a default value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To read and write an atom from a component, we use a hook called &lt;code&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/code&gt;. It's just like React's &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;, but now the state can be shared between components:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CountButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCountValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRecoilState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Count Value &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCountValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Click to Increase Count
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#selectors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Selectors
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A selector is basically a piece of derived state, where ‘derived state’ can be defined as the ‘the output of passing state to a pure function that modifies the given state in some way’. So in short when these upstream atoms or selectors are updated, the selector function will be re-evaluated. Components can subscribe to selectors just like atoms, and will then be re-rendered when the selectors change.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;countLabelOddEventState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;countLabelOddEventState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;countState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`isEven`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`isOdd`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see Selectors also have a unique ID like atoms &lt;strong&gt;but not a default value&lt;/strong&gt;. A selector takes atoms or other selectors as input and when these inputs are updated, the selector function gets re-evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; property is the function that is to be computed. It can access the value of atoms and other selectors using the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; argument passed to it. Whenever it accesses another atom or selector, a dependency relationship is created such that updating the other atom or selector will cause this one to be recomputed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selectors can be read using &lt;code&gt;useRecoilValue()&lt;/code&gt;, which takes an atom or selector as an argument and returns the corresponding value. We don't use the &lt;code&gt;useRecoilState()&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;countLabelOddEventState&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;selector is not writeable&lt;/strong&gt; (see the &lt;a href="https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/selector"&gt;selector API reference&lt;/a&gt; for more information on writeable selectors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally i think Recoil is a great library but unless you have some specific problems regarding global state management, you don’t really need it. It's nothing that the developer’s world couldn’t survive without. You can even use Recoil partially in your application, exactly where you need, without having to adopt it for the entire application.&lt;/p&gt;
