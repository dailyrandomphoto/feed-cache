      <title>Changing careers into tech: Why perseverance and mindset matters.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 was the year of &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; for all of us. We had to adapt to a new reality, where draconian words like “lockdown” and “pandemic” became the new normal. It was also the year I decided to turned my life around and change careers…  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What in Summer 2020 seemed to be a huge mountain to climb, it became a reality in early February 2021 and I still have to pinch myself that I actually pulled this off, and &lt;strong&gt;landed my first role and a Frontend Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-true-what-they-say-it-aint-easy" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It's true what they say, it ain't easy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say that changing careers in your early 30’s with a young child in tow sure is challenging, although having a lot of self-discipline and focus definitely helped keeping me in the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re on the same path and pursuing a career in tech, please don’t give up! Stepping out of our comfort zone and trying something new requires a level of mental strength that we might not be used to anymore, especially as adults.&lt;br&gt;
The uncertainty and self-doubt can be hard to manage at times, and in these moments a new mindset must come into play: the &lt;strong&gt;growth mindset&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-mindset-had-to-change" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My mindset had to change
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether I liked or not, I grew up both being moulded by or fighting against what the people around me thought would be the best for me. Good intentions, of course. But it was always implicit that because I wasn’t getting straight As in Maths, pursuing studies or a career in STEM wouldn’t be the best option for me. Unfortunately, lots of girls and young women go through these exact same feelings of inadequacy, having invisible barriers put up in front of them.&lt;br&gt;
I developed my personality under the assumption I wasn’t good enough or smart enough, and with that came a fixed mindset that lasted throughout my early adulthood. Although I always considered myself hardworking and goal-driven, this mindset eventually led me to follow the path of least resistance. I always tended to dedicate time to things I was comfortable with, where it was easy to see what was on the other side of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software engineering wasn’t even an option for me while growing up in countryside Portugal, especially as a young female. For some time I wanted to be a journalist while my family tried hard to convince me I should study Law. I wasn't having it. I enjoyed being creative and ended up studying New Communication Technologies in University, which thankfully gave me a good mix of user-centric design, coding and computer science fundamentals. I learnt HTML, CSS, ActionScript&lt;br&gt;
(you know Flash was all the rage in 2005) and some PHP (which I now remember absolutely nothing about), with some 3D modeling and video in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perseverance is your most powerful weapon when it comes to learning new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did finish my Bachelor's Degree but I didn’t even consider pursuing a technical role because &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t think I was smart enough, good enough or that i could possibly succeed in the tech world. My Uni experience definitely felt like a "boys club", where the men were into programming and I once again leaned towards the creative aspects of my degree, finding comfort hanging out with other like minded females, who highly likely felt a bit lost like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-career-path-doesnt-have-to-be-linear" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A career path doesn't have to be linear
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being professionally stagnated to a point of having no real sense of direction was consuming me. With age and increasing dissatisfaction in regards to my choice of career, I eventually stopped caring about what people expected of me.&lt;br&gt;
I stopped believing in the notion that you are born with only one talent, and that you are expected to stay in what will likely be a fifty-year work-life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are multidisciplinary beings with a plethora of interests and capabilities and we can find ways to channel them, if we're audacious enough to step outside our own box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a mother, I also wanted to set a good example for my daughter, hoping to become someone she can look up to as she grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#persevere-and-believe-in-yourself" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Persevere and believe in yourself
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be anything you want to be, if you work hard enough and keep persevering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies and discipline. People with a growth mindset tend to achieve more than those who believe their talents are innate gifts, and because of this they will put more energy into learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I stuck with something I was inherently both fascinated and scared by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countless times I considered giving up and taking a U-turn, but I am glad I persevered and kept at it. If changing careers into tech is something you're currently attempting, &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT GIVE UP!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sharing goals with close family and friends will help massively as they will likely be rooting for you, while making you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also extremely important having some badass role models and an incredible sense of support from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; community, where I could share my journey with other folks like me.&lt;br&gt;
There are great initiatives to help you stick to your goals such as #100DaysOfCode, #Javascript30, #7Days7Projects or even #30Days30Projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my next blogpost, I will share some tips and advice from my experience in landing my first tech role!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I  wrote a crawler for the first time.</title>
      <author>Kayla Sween</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:58:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kaylasween/i-wrote-a-crawler-for-the-first-time-58l3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kaylasween/i-wrote-a-crawler-for-the-first-time-58l3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Early on in the pandemic, I decided that I wanted a way to track the moving average of cases per day in my state, Mississippi, since that wasn't something our Department of Health had a graph for at the time. Since I thought, "you know, this won't be too long... I could definitely just do this for a few months," I had been manually adding data for every single day until the end of January. I would frequently forget or just not want to look at the data for a month or more at a time. I realized I needed to find a way to automate this process so I didn't have to go back through the last month's data to update my graph. So, I decided to finally write a crawler to get all that data from our state’s Department of Health website without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-crawler" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Crawler
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this was the easy part. I wanted to write a web crawler in a language I was comfortable with to get it up relatively quickly, so I decided on JavaScript. I took bits and pieces from various tutorials I had found and decided on using Axios to grab the data and Cheerio to parse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start out, I added Axios and Cheerio to my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for yarn: &lt;code&gt;yarn add axios cheerio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
for npm: &lt;code&gt;npm install axios cheerio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I included them in the JavaScript file I used for my crawler code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const axios = require('axios')
const cheerio = require('cheerio')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also do it the ✨ES6 way✨:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import axios from 'axios'
import cheerio from 'cheerio'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also included my JSON file and filestream so I could add the newest data to that JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const fs = require('fs')
const data = require('../src/constants/covidData.json')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I created a function to get the latest cases for the day off of the MSDH website. I fetched the data with Axios, loaded it into Cheerio, and then pulled the value out of the section of the DOM that contained the current day's data. I found this selector by going into the dev tools in the browser and looking for the section of the page that contained the daily case data. In this case, there was a &lt;code&gt;data-description&lt;/code&gt; attribute on a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag that helped me locate the correct HTML element. I removed any commas from the string it returned and made sure that it was getting saved as an integer so it would work with my charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const msdh = 'https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/14,0,420.html'
const getDailyCases = async () =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    const { data } = await axios.get(msdh)
    const $ = cheerio.load(data);
    let dailyCases = parseInt($('[data-description="New cases"]').text().replace(/,/g, ''))

    return dailyCases
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a new date object. And since All data is from the previous day, I set the date to the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let today = new Date()
today.setDate(today.getDate() - 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then initialized my data object to eventually add those two pieces of information to an object to add to my JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let dailyCases = {
    newCases: 0,
    date: today.getFullYear() + '-' + today.getMonth() + '-' + today.getDate() //formatting date to match what I needed
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wrote another async function to call my &lt;code&gt;getDailyCases&lt;/code&gt; function and, after it gets that data, add it to my JSON file as long as there are new cases, and that date doesn't exist in the JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;const getCovidData = async () =&amp;gt; {
  await getDailyCases().then((cases) =&amp;gt; dailyCases.newCases = cases)

  if (!data.data.includes(daily.date) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; daily.newCases != 0) {
    data.data.push(dailyCases)

    fs.writeFile('src/constants/covidData.json', JSON.stringify(data), (err) =&amp;gt; {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
    })
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, call that function so that it'll actually run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;getCovidData()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all there is to the crawler! You can check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kaylasween/KaylaSweenWebsite/blob/main/functions/msdatacrawler-background.js"&gt;full crawler file on my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-it-to-run-regularly" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting it to run regularly
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to use a combination of Netlify functions to run the web crawler and Zapier to schedule the daily deployment. I quickly realized this wasn't going to work. Since my database was just a JSON file in my GitHub repo, I needed to make sure that the data was getting added every day. When I tried using the Netlify/Zapier combination, it would run the crawler and "overwrite" the last entry daily, since that data wasn't getting pushed back to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that didn't pan out, I decided to try GitHub Actions, which I had never used before. (&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler&lt;/strong&gt;, this is what I ended up using.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just jumped right into GitHub Actions without any real research or planning. Normally, that's not something I'd recommend. However, it worked out pretty well this time because of how well the default YAML file was commented. I used a lot of the default YAML file for the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the Action to run daily, I used &lt;a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07"&gt;POSIX cron syntax&lt;/a&gt; to set the interval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "00 20 * * *"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of those places separated by spaces represents a unit of time. This will determine how often your Action will run. A lot of times, you may see that denoted by five asterisks (&lt;code&gt;"* * * * *"&lt;/code&gt;). The first place is the minute field. The second place is the hour (which hour in UTC). The third is the day. The fourth is the month (&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;JAN&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;DEC&lt;/code&gt;). Finally, the fifth place is the day of the week (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SUN&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;SAT&lt;/code&gt;). If you leave any of these as a star, it'll run for every one of those units of time. In my code, I wanted my Action to run every day at UTC 20:00 (or 2PM CST) to ensure the Department of Health had time to publish data that day. Therefore, I only put units of time in the minute and hour places and left the rest as asterisks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I determined how often I needed it to run, I needed to define what the actual job (with steps!) was that I need it to run. So I set up Node.js, installed my dependencies (Axios and Cheerio), ran my crawler, and then pushed the changes to my repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on (I left it as the default)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Setup Node.js environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.4
    
      - name: Install axios and cheerio
        run: |
          npm install axios
          npm install cheerio
    
      - name: Get Covid Data
        run: |
          node functions/crawler.js
          
      - name: Push changes
        uses: actions-go/push@v1
        with:
          # The commit message used when changes needs to be committed
          commit-message: "running daily COVID data crawler"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all there is to it! Now the web crawler is running every day! You can check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kaylasween/KaylaSweenWebsite/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml"&gt;GitHub Action file on my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see the final product in action on the &lt;a href="https://www.kaylasween.com/COVID-19/"&gt;COVID-19 page on my website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#seniorish-developers-get-intimidated-too" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Senior-ish developers get intimidated too.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a web crawler was something I put off for a LONG time in my career. It was probably the first thing I was asked to do as a developer (which I didn't). Quite honestly, it intimidated me a lot and took me around 9 years to get over that intimidation. I just assumed that I wouldn't be able to do it, and I let that consume me. Now, every single time I see that commit message "running daily COVID data crawler," I feel so proud. I've built many things throughout my career, but this may be the thing I'm most proud of because &lt;strong&gt;I proved to myself that I could do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson for new developers that sometimes things don't get less scary. You just get less afraid of failing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protecting your API keys with Next JS</title>
      <author>Ivan Maximiliano Saldano</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 13:36:49 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-is-the-story-of-max" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This is the story of Max.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max thought his API keys were safe because he put them inside an &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img width="100%" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/XreQmk7ETCak0/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max didn't know his keys were visible in the network tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B9IgU_U4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613111422990/i0K3IR3U3.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B9IgU_U4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613111422990/i0K3IR3U3.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from 2021-02-12 15-25-47.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
🥲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max is actually me, Max is actually everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when we are just learning and start playing with public APIs that require a private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a good (or any) way to protect your keys in the frontend.&lt;br&gt;
One good alternative is to create a proxy in your own server, since backend code is not exposed to the browser. But many people using these APIs are beginners that don't know much about backend yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Next JS comes to save the with its integrated and ready to use &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction"&gt;API Routes&lt;/a&gt;. Which is basically a Node JS environment that you can use to create API endpoints, a server ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-setup" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let's create a next js app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terminal run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app next-api-key
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;
yarn create next-app next-api-key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then move to the app folder&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;next-api-key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-different-env-file" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A different .env file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once inside the project we can create a &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; file. This looks the same as your normal &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files if you are familiar with them. The difference is that the variables inside &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; are only available in the Node JS environment of Next. This means the browser doesn't have access to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where can we use these variables?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;, there is another folder called &lt;code&gt;api&lt;/code&gt;, any file inside here will be treated as an API endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works more or less like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the server side we have &lt;code&gt;pages/api/hello.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;John Doe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the client side we can call.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchHello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`/api/hello`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// notice the naming&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// data = { name: "John Doe" }&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#protecting-the-keys" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Protecting the keys
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that we know how that works, let's add a key in the &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's pretend I have a key that I need to send in the url of my request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's add the key inside &lt;code&gt;.env.local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;someSecretKeyThatNoOneShouldSee
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And instead of using our key on the client side, we use it inside &lt;code&gt;hello.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This variable won't work on the client anyways, read more &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// pages/api/hello.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://api.i.require.keys/?&amp;amp;api_key=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will need to install axios, node-fetch  or a similar library to manage the fetching, since &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; API is not available in Node.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really changes on the client side, but let's use &lt;code&gt;axios&lt;/code&gt; since we already installed it for the server.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchHello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/api/hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that's about it, our key is nowhere to be seen in the network tab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That wasn't too hard right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/brojenuel/javascript-array-tips-and-tricks-you-should-know-3d0n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An array is one of the most common concepts of Javascript, which gives us a lot of possibilities to work with data stored inside. Taking into consideration that array is one of the most basic topics in Javascript which you learn about at the beginning of your programming path, in this article, I would like to show you a few tricks which you may not know about and which may be very helpful in coding! Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-remove-duplicates-from-an-array" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Remove duplicates from an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very popular interview question about Javascript arrays, how to extract the unique values from Javascript array. Here is a quick and easy solution for this problem, you can use a new Set() for this purpose. And I would like to show you two possible ways to do it, one with .from() method and second with spread operator (…).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;watermelon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// First method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueFruits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueFruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns [“banana”, “apple”, “orange”, “watermelon”, “grape”]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Second method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueFruits2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueFruits2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns [“banana”, “apple”, “orange”, “watermelon”, “grape”]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-replace-the-specific-value-in-an-array" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Replace the specific value in an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s necessary to replace a specific value in the array while creating code, and there is a nice short method to do it which you might not know yet. For this, we may use .splice(start, value to remove, valueToAdd) and pass there all three parameters specifying where we want to start modification, how many values we want to change and the new values.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;watermelon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;potato&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tomato&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns [“potato”, “tomato”, “orange”, “watermelon”, “apple”, “orange”, “grape”, “apple”]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-map-array-without-map" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Map array without .map()
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably everyone knows .map() method of arrays, but there is a different solution that may be used to get a similar effect and very clean code as well. We can use .from() method for this purpose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;friends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Peter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

  4. Empty an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have an array full of elements but you need to clean it for any purpose, and you don’t want to remove items one by one? It’s very simple to do it in one line of code. To empty an array, you need to set an array’s length to 0, and that’s it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;watermelon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  5. Convert array to an object
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens that we have an array, but for some purpose, we need an object with this data, and the fastest way to convert the array into an object is to use a well-known spread operator (…).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

  6. Fulfill array with data
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some situations when we create an array, and we would like to fill it with some data, or we need an array with the same values, and in this case .fill() method comes with an easy and clean solution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  7. Merge arrays
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know how to merge arrays into one array not using .concat() method? There is a simple way to merge any amount of arrays into one in one line of code. As you probably realized already spread operator (…) is pretty useful while working with arrays and it’s the same in this case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

  8. Find the intersection of two arrays
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also one of the most popular challenges which you can face on any Javascript interview because it shows if you can use array methods and what is your logic. To find the intersection of two arrays, we will use one of the previously shown methods in this article, to make sure that values in the array we are checking are not duplicated and we will use .filter method and .includes method. As a result, we will get the array with values that were presented in both arrays. Check the code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numTwo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;duplicatedValues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numTwo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;duplicatedValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns [2, 4, 6]&lt;/span&gt;

  9. Remove falsy values from an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, let’s defined falsy values. In Javascript, falsy values are false, 0, „”, null, NaN, undefined. Now we can find out how to remove this kind of values from our array. To achieve this, we are going to use the .filter() method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mixedArr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;NaN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to select a value from the array randomly. To create it in an easy, fast, and short way and keep our code clean we can get a random index number according to the array length. Let’s see the code:&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  11. Reversing an array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we need to flip our array there is no need to create it through the complicated loops and functions, there is an easy array method which does it all for us, and with one line of code, we may have our array reversed. Let’s check it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;navy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;purple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversedColors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversedColors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns [“brown”, “black”, “yellow”, “orange”, “purple”, “pink”, “navy”, “green”, “white”, “blue”]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-lastindexof-method" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  12. .lastIndexOf() method
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Javascript, there is an interesting method which allows finding the index of the last occurrence of the given element. For example, if our array has duplicated values, we can find the position of the last occurrence of it. Let’s see the code example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastIndexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns 9&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-sum-all-the-values-in-the-array" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  13. Sum all the values in the array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge which happens very often during Javascript Engineer interviews. Nothing scary comes here; it can be solved using .reduce method in one line of code. Let’s check out the code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns 14&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Still got love for format()</title>
      <author>Joe Neville</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 12:05:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/joeneville_/still-got-love-for-string-format-4ck3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/joeneville_/still-got-love-for-string-format-4ck3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;✍️ In my previous post about Python f-strings, I was a little too hard on the older string formatting approach, format().&lt;br&gt;
👀 I was focused solely the string formatting in terms of string substitution, for which I find f-strings the more intuitive and superior approach.&lt;br&gt;
🧰 However, as some devs rightly pointed out, format has some other, very useful, features, and should not be consigned to the mental dustbin. But rather dusted off and placed alongside f-strings in your Python toolkit when it comes to strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#format-uses" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  format() uses
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#formatting-strings-with-variable-substitution-and-concatenation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👉 Formatting strings with variable substitution and concatenation
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"know"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"thanks!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Yes, we already {} this, {} {}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;already&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;know&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;thanks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far, so f-strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#string-formatting-with-padding" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👉 String formatting with padding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling to structure your string lay-out and presenting them in a way that is pleasing to the eye, format can help. Rather than having to count out 26 whitespaces each time (or was it 25) to get them to line up, you can use padding.&lt;br&gt;
Rather than just use empty curly braces, padding allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define a field size to be inserted into the string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;position your characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;define the fill characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the curly braces, to the right of a colon, add the minimum number of character fields: &lt;code&gt;{:20}&lt;/code&gt; this will be 20 fields minimum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Give me some {:20} please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Give&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="n"&gt;please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use "&amp;lt;" to left-align, "&amp;gt;" to right align and "=" to centre. The default is to left-align, as above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Give me some {:&amp;gt;20} please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Give&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Give me some {:^20} please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Give&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add in a character to fill the designed number of spaces, the default is just whitespace:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Give me some {:*^20} please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Give&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*******&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;********&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that if you want to use your own fill characters, you need to set the alignment as well, not rely on the default. Thus for left-align:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# This will throw an error
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Give me some {:*20} please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Invalid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;specifier&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Define the alignment
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Give me some {:*&amp;lt;20} please!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Give&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;***************&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, format uses a "mini-language" that has numerous other options. &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language"&gt;Check the Python docs for more info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's going to be some uses for padding, but if you are trying to align your text into a table, there are Python libraries for that, which are probably a better option, like &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/"&gt;tabulate.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessing-dictionary-values" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👉 Accessing Dictionary Values
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're working with Python dictionaries, format has another useful feature for you. You can access the values of a dictionary directly from format. No need to unpack to variables then reference them, you can call the dictionary inside the format argument.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"colour"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sky Blue"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"volume"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;"For sale, {volume} litres of {colour} paint"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;'For sale, 5 litres of Sky Blue paint'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-this-docs-for-more" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👉 Check this docs for more
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;format() has even more features that those listed here, &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#format-examples"&gt;check the Python docs for more examples.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Also, I've used &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3"&gt;this blog from Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; a few times. It presents information about format() in a style that I found easier to understand than diving straight in the official docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, f-strings and format(); group hug. 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/orkhanjafarovr/reactend-the-story-of-react-js-on-backend-103h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I promised in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/orkhanjafarovr/express-in-react-react-backend-whut-4lkg"&gt;my previous article&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the project/framework to build your &lt;strong&gt;React-like http-server&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
@reactend/express repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/gigantz/reactend-express"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-that" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's that?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js http-server based on React-Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express.js inside&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get, Post, Delete and etc. components to use router method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Get(render)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Res.Render&lt;/code&gt; to render your regular React DOM Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;useContext(ReqResContext) hook to access &lt;code&gt;req, res&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support &lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in logger (morgan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleware component in Router and its Routes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;handler&lt;/code&gt; prop in Route components to use as regular controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and many many features that should be documented...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-started" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get started
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run this to create reactend project on your local machine&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-reactend my-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#play-with-that-on-replit" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Play with that on repl.it
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🕹 &lt;a href="https://repl.it/@orkhanjafarov/reactend-playground?v=1"&gt;Playground on repl.it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-example" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Example
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;registerApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@reactend/express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ExpressApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  You can use this way too
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#components" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Components
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note. This minor description for now (Docs is on the way)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;App /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - App Instance (props: port)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Static /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Static route (props: publicPath, path, options)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Router /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Router-Provider (props: path)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Get /&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;Post /&amp;gt; and ...&lt;/code&gt; - Route component (props: path, content, handler, status)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Middleware /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Middleware (props: handler)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Logger /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - morgan logger (props: mode, disabled)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Res /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Response components&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Res.Render /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Render (props: component)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Res.Content /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Response send (props: json, text, contentType) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Res.Status /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Response Status (props: statusCode)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Res.SendFile /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Response Send File (props: path, options, onError)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Res.Redirect /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Redirect (props: path, statusCode)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-planning" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is planning?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done with Docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on fixes/updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an article about "How it works inside" &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear. It's not a production-ready product and it's not Next.js or whatever. &lt;strong&gt;Reactend&lt;/strong&gt; is an experimental project to integrate React into Node.js server. But I'm working on it and trying to nail it. Let see :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow me on twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/orkhanjafarovr"&gt;@orkhanjafarovr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers 🎉✨,&lt;br&gt;

      <title>5 Tips for effective meetings</title>
      <author>Mauro Garcia</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 11:11:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mauro_codes/5-tips-for-effective-meetings-40dd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mauro_codes/5-tips-for-effective-meetings-40dd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After listening to the last episode of the DevDiscuss podcast with &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/ben"&gt;@ben&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/jess"&gt;@jess&lt;/a&gt;
, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoodmanCenter"&gt;Andy Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to make a post talking about what I've learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you want to listen to the full episode, follow &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devdiscuss/s4-e1-this-is-how-you-have-effective-meetings"&gt;this link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prepare-your-agenda" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prepare your agenda
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a well-prepared agenda is the single best predictor of a successful meeting. The agenda should cover all the things that have to be covered to prepare people to be effective. Besides, it would help if you didn't think about the agenda as a simple list of topics but as a strategic plan for the next hour of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips for a well-prepared agenda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the objective of the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send invitations to all the participants 24 to 48 hours in advance to discuss who should be there and who doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of topics that should be handled during the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each topic on the list, you may consider including:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A notation to explain how the topic will be handled. You can use three kinds of interactions: 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Information&lt;/strong&gt;: Meaning you'll inform about something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Discuss&lt;/strong&gt;: Meaning that you’re going to bring up a topic here, and you'll ask for feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Meaning that this item will lead to an action (making a decision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name of the person who'll handle or present that topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The estimated duration for the item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may include a "WW, DW, BW" (Who will do what by when) section at the end of the agenda. There you'll specify the responsible, the responsibility, and the deadline for each task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#avoid-voting-try-gradients-of-agreement" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Avoid voting; try "Gradients of Agreement."
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about voting to make a decision is that there'll always be winners and losers. If you lose, you'll feel like you didn't get what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why you could consider using a technique called "Gradients of Agreement" to see where everyone is without making a decision. With this technique, each participant can choose between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endorse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endorse with reservations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disagree, but don't block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚠️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're faced with &lt;strong&gt;ambiguous support&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning the participants are all over the scale in response to a decision, it could be a sign that the problem was poorly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👎
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're faced with &lt;strong&gt;meager support&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that although some team members are clustered towards endorsement, others are clustered in the low part of the scale (disagree or veto), you may consider slowing down and search for better ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to dig deeper into &lt;strong&gt;Gradients of Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;, check out the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210428/http://www.teamstarproject.org/pdf/Team%20Decision%20Making.pdf"&gt;following link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#think-about-the-people" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Think about the people
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some basic rules as to what people expect from a meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want their time to be used constructively and efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to know what do they need to do to come prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to be clear about what do you expect from them after the meeting as a follow-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-it-short" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep it short
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though there are certain types of meetings that could last for hours, most of the time it's really hard to keep everyone's attention for more than 1 hour. This is especially true for online meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to keep your meetings under 1 hour so everyone can contribute in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#listen-to-understand-and-dont-speak-just-to-be-heard" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Listen to understand and don't speak just to be heard.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a participant of the meeting, try to be a good listener:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen with the intent to understand, not to respond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to speak up only if you have something to contribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid speaking just to be heard or to leave your mark on the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final thoughts
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software developer, I attended thousands of meetings during the last ten years. I witnessed awful discussions and productive conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've met with people that like to use meetings as an excuse to take a break and with people that only call a meeting after an exhaustive preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience tells me that meetings can be a game-changer tool if they're used properly. It's up to each organization to follow validated methods and make a clear and complete plan for each meeting to take full advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-there-any-good-tip-that-im-missing-let-me-know-in-the-comments-below" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is there any good tip that I'm missing? Let me know in the comments below 👇

      <title>The Most Important Thing to Understand About Component Composition 🚀</title>
      <author>Tomasz Kula</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 10:42:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/realtomaszkula/the-most-important-thing-to-understand-about-component-composition-3ia4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/realtomaszkula/the-most-important-thing-to-understand-about-component-composition-3ia4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you are working on an e-commerce application and are tasked with creating a product page that renders a call to action button to buy awesome Nike shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the app has a following component tree:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; product-page
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card-content
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cta-button
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You want to render "Buy Air Max" as a label of the call to action button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is the button component is deeply nested in the component tree, and the product model information is available in the top most component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; product-page &amp;lt;-- Here we know the product name
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card-content
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cta-button  &amp;lt;-- Here we want to render the product name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-struggle" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Struggle
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might jump in and create the &lt;code&gt;@Input()&lt;/code&gt; in each component and pass it down to the button component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- product-page.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[productName]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"productName"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- card.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;card-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[productName]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"productName"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- card-content.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;cta-button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[productName]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"productName"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/cta-button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- cta-button.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Buy {{ productName }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It works fine, but there are couple of issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are adding &lt;code&gt;@Inputs()&lt;/code&gt; to components which don't use them, only passing them down to the child components.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; product-page 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card &amp;lt;-- I don't care about the product name
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card-content &amp;lt;-- I don't care about the product name
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cta-button  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes adding additional &lt;code&gt;@Inputs()&lt;/code&gt; painful. If button needs more data from the product page, you have to pass it through two other components. This process is sometimes referred to as prop drilling.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; product-page &amp;lt;- We know the product price
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card &amp;lt;-- I have to add @Input() for price
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; card-content &amp;lt;-- I have to add @Input() for price
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cta-button &amp;lt;-- I have to add @Input() for price
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes unit testing more difficult as you have to test passing the &lt;code&gt;@Inputs()&lt;/code&gt; in each component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Solution
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve this problem using a different approach. How about we use content projection instead of drilling props with &lt;code&gt;@Inputs()&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare the previous solution, with the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- product-page.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;cta-button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Buy {{ productName }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/cta-button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- card.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-content&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ng-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- card-content.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-content&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ng-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- cta-button.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-content&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ng-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach has the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We no longer add &lt;code&gt;@Inputs()&lt;/code&gt; to components that don't need them so we avoid prop drilling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Components become more extensible. You can pass as much information to the button component as you'd like, without touching the card components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the previous points, unit testing becomes much easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-benefits" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Benefits
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see how we might benefit from this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you are now tasked with extending the call to action button with a price tag - "Buy Air Max at $199".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With content projection approach, we only need to make a small change in the product page component:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- product-page.component --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;cta-button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Buy {{ productName }} at {{ productPrice }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/cta-button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/card-content&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/card&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! See how easy it is? No props drilling, no test changes for the child components, no problem :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you're having a great one, and I'll see you for more web dev posts in the future 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>dato.rss - RSS with Ruby</title>
      <author>Davide Santangelo</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/daviducolo/dato-rss-rss-with-ruby-3fj1</guid>

  &lt;a href="#intro" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My latest side Rails project is Search Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://datorss.com"&gt;dato.rss&lt;/a&gt; is a simple, clean and fast RSS search engine with a RESTful API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the project is divided into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; Quickly search through the millions of available RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESTful API:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns feed data into an awesome API. The API simplifies how you handle RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds. You can add and keep track of your favourite feed data with a simple, fast and clean REST API. All entries are enriched by Machine Learning and Semantic engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#search" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Search
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search is just implemented with Full Text Search Postgres feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;em&gt;pg_search Gem&lt;/em&gt;, which can be used in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi Search:&lt;/strong&gt; Search across multiple models and return a single array of results. Imagine having three models: Product, Brand, and Review. Using Multi Search we could search across all of them at the same time, seeing a single set of search results. This would be perfect for adding federated search functionality to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Scope:&lt;/strong&gt; Search within a single model, but with greater flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the implementation I found very useful the article &lt;a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/full-text-search-ruby-rails-postgres"&gt;https://pganalyze.com/blog/full-text-search-ruby-rails-postgres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;ALTER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;TABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entries&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;COLUMN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;searchable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tsvector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;GENERATED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;setweight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_tsvector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'simple'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;coalesce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'A'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;setweight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_tsvector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'simple'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;coalesce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'B'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;setweight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_tsvector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'simple'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;coalesce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'C'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;STORED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use some features such as adding a new feed you need a token with &lt;strong&gt;write&lt;/strong&gt; permission. Currently only I can enable it. In case contact me&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TIL • I discovered GitHub for Unity and GitHub CLI commands</title>
      <author>Michelle Mannering</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably the coolest thing I learned this week, is how to better use GitHub with Unity. One of the problems with Unity is there are a lot of tiny files and some of them have exceptionally long file names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github-for-unity" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub for Unity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search of the term “how to store Unity files on GitHub” gave me an interesting result: &lt;a href="https://unity.github.com/"&gt;GitHub for Unity&lt;/a&gt;. This is an open source project which adds GitHub directly into Unity. It’s almost like working with GitHub desktop, only within Unity itself. You can choose the files you want to add, enter your commit message, and then commit to main all from Unity. But this still didn’t solve the problem of these crazy long file names that don’t seem to fit nicely into GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vJ70wriM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://practicaldev-herokuapp-com.freetls.fastly.net/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/github-for-unity"&gt;
        github-for-unity
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity"&gt;
        Unity
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      GitHub for Unity
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
&lt;a href="https://unity.github.com"&gt;GitHub for Unity&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GitHub for Unity extension brings &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub into &lt;a href="https://unity3d.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, integrating source control into your work with friendly and accessible tools and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reach the team right here by opening a &lt;a href="https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues/new"&gt;new issue&lt;/a&gt;. You can also tweet at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubUnity" rel="nofollow"&gt;@GitHubUnity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/github-windows/unity" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ea4dd250803e336cb006953976c5d573cbc448b545d1bd4bb58682f78f66fef2/68747470733a2f2f63692e6170707665796f722e636f6d2f6170692f70726f6a656374732f7374617475732f6769746875622f6769746875622d666f722d756e6974792f556e6974793f6272616e63683d6d6173746572267376673d74727565" alt="Build Status"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Notices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug"&gt;list of known issues&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure you have backups of your work before trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From version 0.19 onwards, the location of the plugin has moved to &lt;code&gt;Assets/Plugins/GitHub&lt;/code&gt;. If you have version 0.18 or lower, you need to delete the &lt;code&gt;Assets/Editor/GitHub&lt;/code&gt; folder before you install newer versions. You should exit Unity and delete the folder from Explorer/Finder, as Unity will not unload native libraries while it's running. Also, remember to update your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Building and Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github-for-unity/Unity/master/docs/contributing/how-to-build.md"&gt;How to Build&lt;/a&gt; document for information on how to build GitHub for Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That’s when one of my viewers (remember I am streaming while I’m learning) chimed in and said I should use the command line. I’ve been doing a lot of work using the &lt;a href="https://cli.github.com/"&gt;GitHub CLI&lt;/a&gt; and it’s been amazing. Being able to clone, fork, create repos and more from the terminal makes life a lot easier. I totally forgot (or rather didn’t really know how) the command line allows you to make lots of changes all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#github-command-line-for-uploading-long-unity-files" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GitHub Command Line for uploading long Unity files
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;, which means you specifically identify files for git to ignore; or rather not bother committing them to your repo. If you want all your files in one place then this isn’t really an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do to get all these long file names onto GitHub? Use the command line. Here’s the commands we discovered to help you commit your Unity files to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command will tell you whether the CLI is installed, as well as information about what version you have. Plus it gives you a list of useful commands to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you need to navigate to your local git folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd #add your file location for your local project here&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to change all the long file names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;` git config --system core.longpaths true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will look like nothing happens, but all the names changed. If this doesn't work for you, then run your terminal as admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add all the files to your local git:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; git add . &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt; add . &lt;/code&gt; means that you're all all the files in your local directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LzaNAtDu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/87sfnzh1yx7eh07eoi2x.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LzaNAtDu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/87sfnzh1yx7eh07eoi2x.gif" alt="git long"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit all the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; git commit &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of changes will happen, and colours. Make sure you then finalise the commit by adding the commit message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; git commit -m #add your commit message in here &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might take a while depending on how big the repo is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage they are still on your local machine. Now you just need to add them to GitHub. Do this by using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0_v4QKaI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5vdhif6msaf74p3zqpwy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0_v4QKaI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5vdhif6msaf74p3zqpwy.gif" alt="git add"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#join-me-on-stream" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Join me on Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun learning about this and really excited to see some more open source projects as we stream. If you want to join in on these streams, &lt;a href="https://twitch.tv/MishManners"&gt;follow me on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and tune in when we go live. Guaranteed fun times, learning, and lots of great networking.&lt;br&gt;
If want to watch these recordings then check out the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/910770320"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/910781876"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; streams on Unity game dev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#join-the-lego-game-challenge" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Join the LEGO Game Challenge
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also using the &lt;a href="https://store.unity.com/lego-microgame"&gt;LEGO Microgame&lt;/a&gt; to test this all out and have some fun. Participate in the &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/challenges/6811cf30-f944-4dfa-8714-9b38be6fbb52?query=&amp;amp;sort=top"&gt;LEGO Microgame challenge&lt;/a&gt; to win cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Secrets of An Authenticated  GitHub Action Workflow
</title>
      <author>Brian Douglas</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 23:26:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/github/the-secrets-of-authenticated-github-action-workflow-3i5o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/github/the-secrets-of-authenticated-github-action-workflow-3i5o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions is a combination of primitives for users to quickly ship integrations for their repos. Some of these primitives include the API, webhooks, and authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach towards authentication has previously been centralized around the &lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;. Before GitHub Actions, your need to create these manually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are unfamiliar tokens, let me point you to the docs on &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token"&gt;creating a personal access token&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub automatically creates a &lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt; secret to use in your Github Action workflows. You can use this &lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt; to authenticate in a specific workflow runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you enable GitHub Actions, GitHub installs a GitHub App on your repository. The &lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt; secret is a GitHub App installation access token. You can use the installation access token to authenticate on behalf of the GitHub App installed on your repository. The token's permissions are limited to the repository that contains your workflow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see "&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token"&gt;Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Permission&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Access type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Access by forked repos&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;actions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;checks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;contents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;deployments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;issues&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;metadata&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;packages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;pull requests&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;repository projects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;statuses&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read/write&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a token that requires permissions that aren't available in the given &lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;, you can create a personal access token and set it as a secret in your repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before each job begins, GitHub fetches an installation access token for the job. The token expires when the job is finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt; to create an issue in my team's repository. As an aside, GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub, and that means most teams have a repository associated with them, including (finance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The permission to create and manage issues is granted through the &lt;strong&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/strong&gt;. To leverage it, I pass it to my created Action directly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;01 13 * * &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Top &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;createAnIssue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Create an issue&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;actions/checkout@v2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Create an issue&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;bdougie/create-an-issue@e43b083ea71e22e77a81ffb4a55dacb2addb71ed&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/TOP5.md&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer just learning to code with a desire to focus on web development but confused on what path to take. Be that front-end or back-end web development or perhaps you have already started your journey and are questioning whether you are on the right path? This would be a good article for you to read. It’s important to have a good understanding of both front-end and back-end web development when starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front-end development is commonly referred to as client-side development and that focuses on everything that you see, experience, and interact with on a website or an application.&lt;br&gt;
On the flip side of things, we have back-end development, and it’s commonly referred to as server-side development and that’s going to be things that are more focused on functionality, data, algorithms, and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend-development" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Front-End Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;― Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front-end development encompasses everything on the website or application that you’re used to seeing. Things like layouts, dropdown menus, buttons, and responsive design. The core three languages you’ll need to learn if you want to do front-end development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies all enable us to design our website and also allow for interaction on the client-side which is the browser. Also, there are front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Stylus, Semantic UI, Tailwind CSS, and so on for CSS which speeds up workflow. React, Vue, and Angular for JavaScript, are tools developers leverage to develop advanced web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BYVN9PWY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613084576262/OhA4JGeRF.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BYVN9PWY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613084576262/OhA4JGeRF.jpeg" alt="pexels-photo-3800536.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great analogy to describe front-end development is kind of like a restaurant. There’s the dining room which is the main restaurant where a client sits down, a serving staff brings the menu, the client reads, makes an order, and their food is served. This is client-side, this is what the user sees in the browser, they can interact with the website using JavaScript and see the information that’s been displayed using HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough said about front-end development, now let’s move on to back-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backend-development" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Back-End Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back-end web development is the core computational logic of a website, software, or information system. A back-end developer creates components and features that are indirectly accessed by a user through a front-end application or system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;― Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back-end is the structure and processes behind the curtains that make everything run, these include storing and organizing data, creating algorithms and complex logic for a seamless experience on the front-end. The languages a back-end developer should be well versed in are Python, PHP, Ruby, or Java, and also, it’s interesting to note that JavaScript can also be used as a back-end language with something like NodeJS which allows you to execute JavaScript not just in the browser but in a back-end environment. Also, there are frameworks like Express for NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Flask/Django for Python, and these speed up development using the particular back-end technology you chose. The main job of these frameworks is simply to reduce the amount of repetitive stuff that a developer has to do. They make our lives as developers so much easier by cutting down some of the grinch work and saving us a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OK7rbwkJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613084943848/FYc2b_EOH.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OK7rbwkJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613084943848/FYc2b_EOH.jpeg" alt="photo-1524491561693-20766fdcd934.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo by  &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@kennyluoping?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;Kenny Luo&lt;/a&gt;  on  &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward with our analogy, on the back-end, we’ve got the kitchen, and this is analogous to our server, this is the place where all of our dishes get prepared and served. When the client asks for pizza, that order gets sent to the server, the server should be able to send back what it was that the client ordered, which is the actual pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the larder where all the ingredients are stored is of course the database, this is where all of our user data, our event data, all of the data that makes our website work is stored. So, this is where the divide between the front end and back end happens. It’s between the dining room of the restaurant and the kitchen and larder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back-end technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, etc, enable us to interact with databases and have business logic on a server and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The back-end consists of things such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A server that will serve up your files that’s your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A database that can store your user data as their logins and passwords,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications which are where you create your business logic, you determine how your web applications work, for example, things such as calculating flight prices or making payments, that sort of stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you want to book a ticket for an event on a website and you enter your name and buy a ticket, now that information which consists of your name, how many tickets you bought, and your registration details such as your email gets saved to the website’s database. You can just imagine these databases as these giant excellent spreadsheets living somewhere, and almost all of your data that you’ve entered gets saved onto these spreadsheets, and that means that when you come back at a later date, you’re able to log back on to the website and it would be able to retrieve from its database all of the data that is associated with your account, in this case, it would retrieve your tickets to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also have what we call full-stack developers, and you can tell by the name that it’s the combination of both front-end and back-end development. It is the flexibility of working with the front and back end that makes you so much more desirable as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope having a basic understanding of this will help you choose the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
