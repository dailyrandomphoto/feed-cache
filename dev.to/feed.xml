      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of using PowerApps with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations. Part 1 is &lt;a href="https://dev.to/robvanb/d365-f-o-and-powerapps-3m1k"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a short post, as there is not much to it.&lt;br&gt;
As seen in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/robvanb/d365-f-o-and-powerapps-3m1k"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, you can link to a (canvas) PowerApp from the D365 F&amp;amp;O UI by using the 'PowerApp' button.&lt;br&gt;
However, you can also 'embed' the (canvas) PowerApp in the UI, but this has to be done through actual F&amp;amp;O development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this doesn't make a lot of sense. The whole idea of the NoCode/LowCode PowerApps is that you do NOT need a developer (and consequent downtime and deployment).&lt;br&gt;
But since the option is there, I figured I'd try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official documentation is here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/embed-power-apps#developer-modeling-a-canvas-app-on-a-form"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/embed-power-apps#developer-modeling-a-canvas-app-on-a-form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt;: I know the example below makes no business sense. I'm showing sales order lines in the PowerApp that are already present in the F&amp;amp;O form that I add the App to. But since I already had the App from part 1, I figured I'd just reuse it to show the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-the-app-to-a-screen-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding the App to a screen (form)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual dev task is very simple. For this example we will be adding the App from part 1 in a new tab in the 'Sales Orders' inquiry form. ('Retail and Commerce -&amp;gt; Inquiries and Reports -&amp;gt; Sales Orders').&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form name is 'MCRSalesTableOrderHistory', so we first create an extension to that form in Visual Studio.&lt;br&gt;
Then we simply add a tab page, and add a 'PowerAppsHost' control to the page.&lt;br&gt;
In the properties we set the AppId and the field that we want to pass to the App as the key. (Review &lt;a href="https://dev.to/robvanb/d365-f-o-and-powerapps-3m1k"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; for details)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EZFRVOHQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/knjemcct1h5poknli9p3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EZFRVOHQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/knjemcct1h5poknli9p3.jpg" alt="VS_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scaling of the App in the UI is pretty terrible. I manually set the height and width in the control's properties, but it still renders it with a very tiny font. &lt;br&gt;
I have not tried to modify the actual App to use a larger font, but in my opinion this should not be necessary.&lt;br&gt;
In any case, it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work, the order lines of the order I selected in the main grid are displayed in the PowerApp.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WJKF_sms--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/unurc82d4dzxpccmtba8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WJKF_sms--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/unurc82d4dzxpccmtba8.jpg" alt="FO_form_2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you see where I set the properties to try and make it bigger (did not work):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_HiwA8Ti--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j59cw50rlixrix907w44.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_HiwA8Ti--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j59cw50rlixrix907w44.jpg" alt="VS_2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add embedded PowerApps directly to the F&amp;amp;O UI. It works. However, I have trouble finding a scenario where you would want to do this.&lt;br&gt;
The only thing I can think of is when you have a PowerApp that serves up data/functionality of an external (non-F&amp;amp;O) system.&lt;br&gt;
But still the rendering in the UI looks pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I made 100 CSS loaders for your next project</title>
      <author>Temani Afif</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/afif/i-made-100-css-loaders-for-your-next-project-4eje</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/afif/i-made-100-css-loaders-for-your-next-project-4eje</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You either make a super fast website/application or you use loaders. I think most of us fall into the second category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question is: what loader should I use? the "loading" text, the 3 dots, a progress bar, the Batman symbol?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You no more need to bother yourself searching for loaders. Find below a collection of 100 different CSS loaders. From the simple one to the more fancy one, you will find the most suitable for your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each loader is done using a &lt;strong&gt;single&lt;/strong&gt; element. Yes, only one &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, nothing more. You don't have to copy a ton of code. Add a class to your div and start loading!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of content
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#the-dots"&gt;The Dots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#the-bars"&gt;The Bars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#the-spinner"&gt;The Spinner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#the-continuous"&gt;The Continuous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Backstage: cryptographic R&amp;D internship at Cossack Labs</title>
      <author>Cossack Labs</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 12:52:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cossacklabs/backstage-cryptographic-r-d-internship-at-cossack-labs-24dg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cossacklabs/backstage-cryptographic-r-d-internship-at-cossack-labs-24dg</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cryptography is easy, getting into cryptography is hard"—yay or nay? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! I'm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vixentael"&gt;Anastasiia&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/"&gt;Cossack Labs&lt;/a&gt;. We are a data protection company and our work is closely related to applied cryptography, both traditional and cutting-edge. Recently, we’ve launched an invite-only cryptographic internship, aimed at computer science students who want to work in the applied crypto space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I’d like to share some backstage details about our crypto R&amp;amp;D internship program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔸 &lt;strong&gt;Crypto R&amp;amp;D at Cossack Labs&lt;/strong&gt; 🔸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto R&amp;amp;D has been our main area of interest since Cossack Labs’ launch in 2014, and based on R&amp;amp;D we've built our product line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being focused on data security, we developed &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/products/"&gt;a number of data protection solutions&lt;/a&gt;: open source crypto libraries, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra"&gt;software for transparent data encryption in databases&lt;/a&gt;, verifiable audit logging system, a framework for operations on end-to-end encrypted data, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our crypto R&amp;amp;D engineers work on &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/whitepapers/"&gt;complex and interesting issues&lt;/a&gt; at the forefront of modern cryptography: zero knowledge proofs, private information retrieval, smpc, searchable encryption, transaction privacy, and other applied issues in this domain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cover a full cycle of modern cryptographic problems: from scientific papers and math, test implementations and PoCs — to production-ready implementations of cryptographic controls in software and integration with third-party infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔸 &lt;strong&gt;Who are crypto R&amp;amp;D engineers?&lt;/strong&gt; 🔸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto R&amp;amp;D lies at the intersection of multiple technologies: cryptography, software engineering, information security, and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, our crypto R&amp;amp;D engineers are either engineers with a cryptological education and a good understanding of the software development process and limitations (from performance to maintainability), or software engineers with deep experience in applied cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔸 &lt;strong&gt;Crypto R&amp;amp;D internship&lt;/strong&gt; 🔸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, crypto R&amp;amp;D engineering is a rare specialisation that demands to develop more than a few skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not many universities have rich &amp;amp; real-world cryptology education, which makes this profession even harder to enter. During the job interviews, we often see how big is the gap between university knowledge and &lt;a href="https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/bestpapers.php"&gt;the discussions in a global cryptographic community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill this gap, we launched our own internship for computer science students interested in cryptography. Currently, we’re beta testing the program with several interns involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training program is very practical and consists of several large topics to be covered in 4-6 months. Our interns are undergrad students, so they combine university courses with the internship and work with us in a part-time paid remote job mode — with flexible hours, regular calls and reviews, mentored by me and my colleagues who are academic cryptographers, software and security engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔸 &lt;strong&gt;Who and why needs crypto R&amp;amp;D internship&lt;/strong&gt; 🔸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students 🎓, the internship is a chance to learn more about modern cryptography &amp;amp; data protection and find out if it fits their future career expectations. Also, it’s a great opportunity to work with a group of software developers and applied cryptographers, leave a track record in open source projects, practice teamwork, analyze scientific papers, and present their own research results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us 🔐, the internship is an option to "lure" students into this interesting field, give them the advantage to meet cutting-edge cryptography, and, of course, tutor specialists that can work with us at the applied cryptography forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔹 &lt;strong&gt;Internship agenda&lt;/strong&gt; 🔹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack the program in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comprises theory (books, courses, scientific papers) and practice (Rust coding, problem-solving, implementation of crypto primitives).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus not on coding per se, but on the ability to discuss problems and solutions with colleagues, explain the code, and teamwork. The level of tasks is gradually becoming more sophisticated and approaches the real-life tasks of our engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔹 &lt;strong&gt;Basics&lt;/strong&gt; 🔹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, interns study the fundamentals: how cryptographic primitives work under the hood, why using padding and what are padding attacks, how stream ciphers work, CTR bitflipping, dangers of using &lt;code&gt;IV == key&lt;/code&gt;, how hashes work, what's behind of &lt;code&gt;xor nonce&lt;/code&gt;, how RSA/DSA/ECDSA works, key exchange algorithms, side-channel attacks, Merkle trees usage, and other basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use challenges from &lt;a href="https://cryptopals.com/"&gt;cryptopals.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cryptohack.org/"&gt;cryptohack.org&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at understanding the nature of common cryptographic implementation errors. All challenges should be written in Rust and went through a typical code review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this part, interns work on implementation of the already known symmetric cipher on Rust, and their solution must pass test vectors (theoretical correctness) and be compatible with already known implementations of this cipher in Bouncy Castle and OpenSSL (practical correctness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔹 &lt;strong&gt;Real world crypto&lt;/strong&gt; 🔹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the real world work starts. We introduce interns to the world of popular cryptographic libraries, help them to make their first OSS contributions, and let them practice with our cryptographic library &lt;a href="https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt; which provides a high-level crypto API on 14 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the internship, the topics are getting closer to the cutting-edge crypto. We involve interns in the daily work of our cryptographers, such as ZKP, zkSNARKs, private transactions, &lt;a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com/blog/crypto-signed-audit-logs.html"&gt;private verifiable audit logs&lt;/a&gt; — they are reading the same whitepapers as we read and designing crypto modules with our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔹 &lt;strong&gt;Teamwork skills&lt;/strong&gt; 🔹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the cryptographic skills and coding, crypto engineers should be able to "emerge" from the academic world and communicate their thoughts to developers. Each specialist has their own background, and the ability to "translate" information into the language of other people is worth a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We immerse interns in a world where they need to communicate with colleagues in pull requests, discuss problems, and design software in a team. Typical research work can be given as "read the paper, understand how the described technology works, analyze whether it is suitable for the given task, and explain to your fellow non-cryptographers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of our interns said after his presentation: "There are no boring things in crypto" :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔹🔸 &lt;strong&gt;What's next?&lt;/strong&gt; 🔸🔹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our internship is currently undergoing closed beta testing. After finishing, we will adjust the program and, most likely, make the internship a public practice at Cossack Labs. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are interested in applied cryptography, here’s something I can recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Converting String to Float in Python</title>
      <author>hrishikesh1990</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 12:33:52 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/hrishikesh1990/converting-string-to-float-in-python-47mm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this short tutorial, we look at how we can convert a string object into a floating object, we look at different methods and we discuss the limitation as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is a part of our initiative at &lt;a href="https://flexiple.com/"&gt;Flexiple&lt;/a&gt;, to write short curated tutorials around often used or interesting concepts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Content
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#why-would-you-need-to-convert-a-string-to-float-in-python"&gt;Why would you need to convert a String to Float in Python?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#solution-using-the-float-function"&gt;Solution: Using the float() function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#limitations-and-caveats"&gt;Limitation and Caveats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-would-you-need-to-convert-a-string-to-float-in-python"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why would you need to convert a String to Float in Python?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing data types in python is a common practice, and python has provided us with functions to facilitate this. However, one frequently looked up method is converting a string to float. The most common places where you would come across this is while reading and working with files. In such cases, you would need to convert numerical values from a string into float/ int before you can use any operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the above example you would come across similar instances where you would need to convert a string to float in python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution-using-the-float-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution: Using the float() function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this solution we use the most common method to convert any data type including a string to float in python; &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syntax of float():&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; can be an int or a string. It could contain signs, this would not affect the value returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code and Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"123.123"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;123.123&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;f3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see the above strings were converted into a floating object. The only thing you should keep in mind is that the string should contain a numerical decimal or integer value, only then would the float function be able to convert the string to float. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check the data types you can use the &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; function before and after using the &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt;. This function returns the data type of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt;, values of other data types can be converted into integers and strings using the &lt;code&gt;Int()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;12.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;f3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"123"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;f4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;12.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"12.3"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#limitations-and-caveats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Limitations and Caveats
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned earlier, the string should contain a float value else &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the number outside the range of a floating variable it would return &lt;code&gt;OverflowError&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And lastly if the no value is passed as an argument it returns 0.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Growth hacking for developers</title>
      <author>Conti</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 11:46:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/conti/growth-hacking-for-developers-9i0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/conti/growth-hacking-for-developers-9i0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is out of scope to dive deeper in some of the concepts you will read below, so I will stay on the basics, and I will try to break the ice in this topic from a technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-growth-hacking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Growth Hacking?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a set of methodologies, techniques and mindset that allow you to increase your digital product revenues. "Growth" starts from the need to validate an hypothesis to improve a specific area of your product, and in order to do so, a set of experiments must be developed and deployed in your production environment. When an experiment has been very successful, we call it "hack".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#differences-between-digital-marketing-and-growth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Differences between Digital Marketing and Growth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all lets review a classic product funnel (also called "Pirate funnel") which let you analyse how your users go from "knowing" your digital product to "pay" for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: users know about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 Acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;: users register in your product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3 Activation&lt;/strong&gt;: users use your product as you instructed them to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4 Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;: users pay for your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5 Retention&lt;/strong&gt;: users are hooked onto your product, they have a habit of use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6 Referral&lt;/strong&gt;: users tell their friends good things about your product.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m_jQg6c7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf542grsbc4gti4cmoig.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m_jQg6c7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf542grsbc4gti4cmoig.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, Digital Marketing is intended to explore mostly step 1 and 2, while Growth goes from the beginning of the funnel until the end of it, and iterates to continuously improve the funnel efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-are-you-telling-us-that-we-should-give-access-to-our-cicd-to-a-group-of-digital-marketersexpertsinnovators-interested-in-doing-spam-to-our-users-through-some-code-snippets-out-of-our-qa-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So, are you telling us that we should give access to our CI/CD to a group of digital marketers/experts/innovators interested in doing spam to our users through some code snippets out of our QA process?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they need a way to validate their hypothesis to improve the funnel, so what we do, as developers/tech experts, is to offer them a specific method to run experiments in production environment without interacting with us or our roadmap. How? Google Tag Manager, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could use Google Tag Manager to allow them to add &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; tags based on DOM triggers, users segments triggers, etc. They could also add tools such as Google Optimize or Optimizely to build UI tests A/B and use different variants to validate their hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, as a developer, used to think that a feature such as a classic test a/b do not need to be outsourced to an external tool, but man, I was wrong. Both services mentioned above do an excellent job in their free tier, so we do not need to re-invent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-technical-roles-are-needed-in-growth-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which technical roles are needed in Growth? Why?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth Hackers are experts in consumer psychology, innovation, creativity and be able to apply scientific methods to validate their hypothesis, so taking this into account it is difficult for them to build a decent technical knowledge to develop their custom own experiments based on code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of &lt;code&gt;no-code&lt;/code&gt; tools out there that help them to build experiments, but they often reach a point in the hypothesis validation process in which these tools are not enough, and a custom development need to be made. That is when we enter to the play field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiments vary from simple &lt;code&gt;modal windows&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;popups&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CTA bars&lt;/code&gt;, etc, to more complex backend processes, such as building a custom GeoIP location service to trigger specifics experiments to different users segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I wrote a basic tutorial for the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/producthackers/your-own-geoip-service-1-2-maxmind-geoip-aws-sam-52go"&gt;GeoIP service&lt;/a&gt;, in case you are interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your "Growth A-Team" wants to be able to manoeuvre without limitations, both front-end and back-end developers are needed. Cloud platforms knowledge such as AWS, Azure, etc are also important skills to deploy securely and fast experiments based on CDN features, redirections, specific API's endpoints, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-so-our-growth-hackers-are-testing-experiments-through-gtm-whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok, so our Growth Hackers are testing experiments through GTM, what's next?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a hypothesis has been validated using experiments, the normal course of action is to integrate this development into the product roadmap, in order to apply that successful knowledge to the product itself. And from there, iterate again to find more ways to increase funnel performance and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-this-experimentation-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages and disadvantages of this experimentation process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Fast hypothesis validations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; Fast client side validation for the experiments that will occur on their site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; No development resources usage in case the experiment could be completed with a "No-code" approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Expect quality assurance concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Experiments may not comply at first with security and data protection policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; High chance to maintain legacy code if there is not a development process behind these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this content, a bit different what we are used to read here, but I think that our frequent isolation as developers is a barrier to obtain knowledge about other disciplines that interact directly with our world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Graduating soon .. my past, present and future plans 👀</title>
      <author>Iqrah Nadeem</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 11:35:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/iiqrah/graduating-soon-my-past-present-and-future-plans-1nnl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/iiqrah/graduating-soon-my-past-present-and-future-plans-1nnl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi 👋 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Iqrah and I am about to graduate with a BSc. (Hons) Computer Science degree soon 👩‍🎓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in high school, I made the decision to pursue one of the coolest subjects I had ever come across. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still vaguely remember one of the very first CS labs in school where I was introduced to Python and wrote a simple script with variables, operators and print statements. It got me extremely excited ✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then I was only a user, following instructions given by the computer to use various apps. But that day for the first time ever I sensed the power of writing code to make a computer do what I want, communicating in this half-English, half-gibberish language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first year of university, I was ecstatic to come across this thing called hackathons 💖. I attended my very first, and many more, on my own, fell in love with the format and went on to form a hackathon society, helloHackers, and host local hacks days and an annual hackathon,  ManMetHacks, at my university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted everyone at my university to experience a hackathon at least once in their student lives but it clashed with the feelings of being ashamed at not really winning many hackathons or any at the start, so I truly felt like I don't deserve to be the one advocating for it because I must be not smart enough, even though I know hackathons are more than just winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always struggled with feeling proud of any achievements. I always have the mindset that if I can do it, anyone else can, it's nothing special. But if someone else achieves anything, they must be extremely talented and special. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending tons of hackathons, meetups, conferences and tech events has made me acquainted with a whole lot of people, but again, I don't know why but I feel like I'm causing too much of an inconvenience if I reach out to them, so I avoid that until extremely necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in my first year, I learnt about spring internships, applied and got accepted for one. It was a week-long internship with all expense paid for staying at a fancy hotel, travel, food and stipend. The experience was fun in terms of enjoying the materialistic perks but the "work" experience itself was pretty dull. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't enjoy sitting hours on end listening to presentations about how the company functioned. It felt more like a week-long marketing campaign than an internship and the only project we were required to do was a group presentation on Cryptocurrency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I brushed off the experience thinking it was a one-week thing and carried on with my uni life but never applied for short internships again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second-year of uni I learnt about this organisation called Code First: Girls, worked extremely hard on advertising it to the students and was successfully able to set up a chapter and run multiple cohorts of the Python and web development course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first time teaching code and I loved every second of it. The feeling of introducing coding to people brings me a lot of joy, it's one of the most fulfilling things I have experienced ✨.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uni life, for the most part, brought me joy because a lot of our assignments are hands-on project-based and the hackathon duties were always fun to do, except trying to find sponsors, that is my least favourite part about planning hackathons. It was not all sunshine and rainbows but receiving support from my lecturers to start things like the society and CF:G chapter is something I'll always be grateful for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my second year, I also came across the concept of placement years. Prior to this, I was under the impression that I'll have to finish my degree first before I can apply for a full-time role but placement years are essentially a year off from studies right before your final year where you complete a year-long work experience in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed intriguing because I had never had a full-time role before and I would get to experience what it is to work in the industry before graduating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad part about this was the application process. Time-consuming forms, annoying aptitude tests, timed coding interviews, cold rejection e-mails and a whole lot of stress and feeling of worthlessness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing studies, extracurricular and job applications, all at the same time, really took a toll on me but I REALLY wanted to try out the placement year so I applied to any and all opportunities I could find, accepted the very first offer I received and called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from the very moment I accepted the offer, I wasn't too excited about the role, so in hindsight, I didn't only do a disservice to the company but also myself by accepting the offer without much thought, but I didn't know any better then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the pay was good, I got to experience living in a flat that was not a student accommodation, learn adult stuff like setting up bills, pay rent, think about credit score etc but the actual job itself was draining and not fulfilling at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would cry to and fro from work, delay sleeping because it would mean when I wake up I would have to go to work again and try to leave from work as early as possible. My line manager and everyone except one person in the team seemed very nice but the work just didn't align with my goals and I felt like my work was not having any significant positive impact on the world. I was getting paid to spend time on working something that the world will totally be okay without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring back a bit of joy, I continued to travel back to Manchester every week right after work to teach CF:G, attend hackathons some weekends and also started a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/iiqrah"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; to let out my creativity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this helped to an extent but I had reached a dark place and I could not continue any longer. I contacted a counsellor at my University and reached out to my parents for help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's only been one other time when I have felt this extent of sadness and distress, so eventually, I had to make a call for my own happiness and sanity, and discuss the resignation process with my line manager. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a confrontational person, so this was extremely awkward to do but it had to be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to stay at least 9 months on placement for my student visa to not be revoked, I had reached a place where I was ready to even drop out if it meant resigning earlier but the winter holidays and paid leaves helped me get through the duration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had maxed out on my paid leaves so it meant either continuing for a couple of extra weeks than 9 months or get paid less for my last month, I chose the latter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fully aware that I am extremely privileged to be able to do this, but it was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this experience, I was exceptionally unmotivated to do anything really, especially completing my degree. This is also the time the pandemic hit, so in-person hackathons and events stopped, I haven't been the biggest fan of online events but I am getting used to it now, especially YouTube and live-streaming.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original plan was to find a full-time developer job after graduation but that doesn't seem that appealing anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was trying to convince myself to suck it all up and just go with the traditional graduate route of applying for grad jobs, be a little more mindful of accepting an offer and hope for the best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am aware that this placement was a one-off work experience and I see a lot of people loving their job so it's not that I won't ever want to find a full-time role again but I need some time to process and understand before I commit to something of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be gratulating soon and haven't applied for a single job yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been ignoring emails from all the recruitment agencies I sighed up for and don't really have an offer that I can brag about to my circle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this again, I know, comes from a place of privilege that I am super grateful to have but it kind of makes me feel guilty too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a talk with my parents and asked for one more year of their support after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this one year, I want to only work on things that I want to work on and not because someone else is telling me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to concentrate on my health, my content creation skills, do a bit of coding too so that I don't get too rusty and overall just do what I want to do, within reason.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no surety that I'll figure everything out in this one year but I won't be able to live with myself if I don't take this one year off for myself 🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If things don't work out, I'll resort to doing things that I am supposed to do as opposed to things that I want to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be ideal if both of those aligned but as of now they don't, and having the privilege to make a choice, I am choosing to prioritise myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does come with a bit of baggage of feeling like a failure for not applying and finding any jobs and having to leech off of my parents for another year, considering they've already done so much for me already but I need to make peace with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's all that I want to pour out for now 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official one year starts when my results are out in June or July so I still have a few weeks to plan a few things for my year off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's excitement mixed with fear of the unknown but wish me luck I guess 🤞🏼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K bye.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://dev.to/kozlovzxc/js-interview-in-2-minutes-promise-4fhl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kozlovzxc/js-interview-in-2-minutes-promise-4fhl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is a &lt;strong&gt;Promise&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is an object which represents the current state and value of the operation. There are three states for Promises - pending, success, failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longer answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Basically, the idea behind the Promises is fairly simple to understand. It is just a container that will only resolve when some calculations are done. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it will be easier to understand if we just implement it on our own.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataHandlers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalHandlers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Apply handlers one by one and initialize every following handler with the previouses result&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onResolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataHandlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;acc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Just call every onReject&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onReject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Just call every onFinal&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalHandlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We need to set timeout, so our function&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// executed after we set .then, .catch, and .finally&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onResolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onReject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onReject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataHandlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;errorHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;finalHandlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's test it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dataPromise&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Finally!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Finally!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Finally (1)!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Finally (1)!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rejectPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;rejectPromise&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Finally!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Finally!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;throwErrorPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;throwErrorPromise&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// hello&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Finally!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Finally&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This one will produce two errors instead of one.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Can you come up with the fix?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doubleErrorPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doubleErrorPromise&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'first'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'second'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Uncaught 'second'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This is how it should work&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fixedDoubleErrorPromise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fixedDoubleErrorPromise&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'first'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Uncaught 'second'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-life applications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes it is a bit easier to use &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"&gt;async/await syntax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes you will need Promise helpers functions like &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#static_methods"&gt;Promise.all&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"&gt;MDN/Promise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>9 Hiring Tips for Team Leads and Software Engineers</title>
      <author>Vitor Paladini</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 11:19:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vtrpldn/9-hiring-tips-for-team-leads-and-software-engineers-5end</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vtrpldn/9-hiring-tips-for-team-leads-and-software-engineers-5end</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I realized that ever since my first full-time job as a frontend engineer I was somewhat involved or responsible for hiring new people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I always found hiring... Strangely rewarding? I don't know. I have this weird predisposition to deal with work like it is some kind of strategy game. Hiring feels a lot like adding reinforcements to my XCOM squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, this hiring game is far from an easy one, and after many screened candidates, many mistakes, and zero formal HR training, I learned a lot of stuff that I'd love to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to this article, filled to the brim with advice for engineers (and team leads) that suddenly faced a need to add people to their team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind that while some of my learnings are actionable, some others are straight-up opinions, and both are direct consequences of my professional experience. So grab (and share!) what resonates with you and feel free to skip what you don't find applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#treat-candidates-with-the-utmost-respect-and-dignity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Treat candidates with the utmost respect and dignity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting fast with rule freaking zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me mad that this needs to be said, but it does. No candidate should &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; be ignored; no candidate should &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; be left waiting weeks for a status update. That's basic human decency and the absolute minimum you can do when hiring people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the rant, but I've seen friends being treated like crap far too many times. This kind of behaviour is &lt;em&gt;unacceptable&lt;/em&gt; and I wonder why it happens so often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One plausible theory I have is that recruiters (be it HR or engineers) usually fall into this hole where they can't notice the enormous asymmetry of the hiring process and treat people like mere tickets on aboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, as a recruiter, you go through dozens of profiles a day and disqualifying people is just part of the job. When you're finally done, you get a pat on the back, a "job well done", and move forward with other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicants, on the other hand, have much more at stake. Not only because applying for a new job usually takes a significant amount of time, but also because a new job might mean a critical and long-waited career change, more money and safety, a breath of fresh air, a self-realization boost, and fresh, exciting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean you should hire people "because they want that job so badly!!! 😩", but keeping that asymmetry in mind will help you stay empathetic and treat candidates with respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-super-specific-about-what-you-want-what-you-can-offer-and-how-you-hire"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be super specific about what you want, what you can offer, and how you hire
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring takes a lot of mental energy. Replying dozens of emails answering the same question about benefits and stipends over and over is not an intelligent use of that energy. So do yourself a favour and write a comprehensive job listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; detailed list of what does the company expects from the position. Think requirements, values, years of experience with XYZ, what the candidate can say or show to increase their chances, etc. Help them help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And be as detailed, if not more, about what the company can offer as compensation for the role. Salary is a piece of obvious information that should be up top, and you should try and be as specific as you can, a hard number is ideal, but a salary range that accounts for experience works well enough. Don't forget benefits, PTO and sick-days policies, home-office budget, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, do remember to add a section where you explain how the hiring process will be handled. A couple paragraphs describing each step and how long they usually take is enough to keep candidates informed. Being transparent is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like good engineers write new test cases after a newfound bug, make sure to update the job listing with extra info after a candidate emails you with a new question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-some-kind-of-system-where-you-can-keep-track-of-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have some kind of system where you can keep track of everything
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I'm feeling a little bit optimistic, I think that recruiters ignore candidates not because they don't care but because they're terribly disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, that's somewhat understandable. It is easy to see how dealing with hundreds of candidates can be troublesome when you don't have a system to help you go through applications. However, trusting the task of keeping up with hundreds of people to your brain is hard to excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So whenever I have to deal with more than a pair of candidates, I create a Trello board or something similar, like a Google Sheet, to keep control of the process. I'm a fan of creating super-comprehensive pipelines where I can move people through each step so, for a standard hiring process, I'd have columns for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application received &amp;gt; Application reviewed &amp;gt; First meeting invite sent &amp;gt; First meeting confirmed &amp;gt; Skill assessment sent &amp;gt; Skill assessment reviewed &amp;gt; Meeting with hiring manager invite sent &amp;gt; Meeting with hiring manager confirmed &amp;gt; Offer sent &amp;gt; Hired&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary depending on how your recruiting process works, of course, but having a clear picture about every single candidate and where they are in the pipeline brings some much-needed peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-checklist-to-help-you-filter-our-candidates-objectively"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a checklist to help you filter our candidates objectively
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success! You've promoted your job listing very well, some industry influencers even shared it on Twitter, and now you have eighteen hundred applications to sift through. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that number of applications is probably not realistic for the majority of job openings. But be it 1800 or 18, you might not have the time to book a 30-minute chat with &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; that sends you an application. So you need a way to filter these candidates in a fast, fair and objective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's where a checklist comes in handy, and if you wrote a detailed job listing, you're halfway there already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by gathering everything you wrote on the "what we expect from this position" and turn it into a checklist. Does this candidate have 5 years of experience with Node? ✅ Do they have prior leadership experience? ✅ Their past experiences are good evidence of seniority? ✅. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so provides an objective way to compare suitable applicants and gives you a fair (and quick) way to disqualify candidates that don't match the opening requirements. There is no problem with sending a "Thanks, but we expect more experience for candidates applying for this position" if you were transparent about what that amount of experience means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#write-down-with-a-few-canned-wellthought-email-templates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Write down with a few canned, well-thought email templates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great hiring experiences happen when the people behind them are engaged and motivated to do it. So, as it happens in many situations in our industry, if you don't really feel like doing it, you'll do it half-assed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't take that as discouragement. I firmly believe that engineers should be the protagonists of hiring, and "not feeling like it" should be expected from time to time. Hiring is a communication-intensive process that can leave the best, most extrovert engineers feeling drained after a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what do we do when we don't want to work on a problem? We find a way to make that problem easier, more pleasurable to work with. And one thing that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; helps is emails templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go back to our hiring pipeline for a sec:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application received &amp;gt; Application reviewed &amp;gt; First meeting invite sent &amp;gt; First meeting confirmed &amp;gt; Skill assessment sent &amp;gt; Skill assessment reviewed &amp;gt; Meeting with hiring manager invite sent &amp;gt; Meeting with hiring manager confirmed &amp;gt; Offer sent &amp;gt; Hired&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you need to update candidates every time their status changes, be it progress or disqualification. Typing down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello candidate,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we are happy to invite you to the next step /&lt;br&gt;
unfortunately, we decided to not move forward with your application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for each step, for each candidate, gets old real quick. So do yourself a favour and write that email only once and use it as a template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pro HR tools like Recruitee gives you some fancy dynamic tags like [candidate_name] or [position_name], so you don't even need to worry about replacing strings. But even if you don't have those, simply copying and pasting a template (and remembering to change the candidate's name, for god's sake) will save you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, it is good to have a positive (we're moving you to the next step) and a negative (unfortunately, we're not going forward) template for each stage of your pipeline. Just remember rule zero and write those messages with extra care and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good thing to keep in mind is that the longer you took to disqualify a candidate – say, they were dropped out on the last step before hiring – the more invested they were in the position. So take some extra time to write additional feedback for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if you create a dozen templates, you'll still likely have to write some original replies for edge cases. Just make sure to update your job opening page with the information if it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-let-the-ball-on-your-court-for-long"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't let the ball on your court for long
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long recruiting processes suck. Candidates get more anxious (and uninterested) by the week, recruiters get demoralized by slow progress, and sometimes the process takes so long that the open position starts to get questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you need that extra person on your team so badly, why you're taking so long to find them, huh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor hiring decisions, however, also suck tremendously. And sometimes, the only way to prevent that is investing &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time in assessing candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds a lot like a no-win scenario, drag the process for too long and risk losing great candidates to other companies, rush like hell and risk adding a Python backend engineer to your React frontend team. Pretty much an HR &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru"&gt;Kobayashi Maru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do two things to deal with this impossible situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question your leadership (or yourself) about how long the hiring process should be. It is essential to have a "baseline" process that works most of the time, but sometimes you can speed up one step or two to make things go faster without significant negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the process can't be made any faster, prevent it from going even slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to communicate an update to a candidate, do so immediately. If a candidate is unresponsive, check if they're still interested. If other people in the company need to take action, keep bugging that until they do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No candidate should be left waiting because you're "like, super busy" with other tasks. An email takes like 2 minutes, even less if you already created some templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-aware-of-hiring-biases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be aware of hiring biases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human beings are fascinating animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to look into the mirror and see clear-thinking, rational, fair individuals. But we are constant victims of cognitive biases that very much affect our decision-making without consent and, most of the time, without our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don't stay alert of these biases, we might favour candidates for unfair reasons, like them being surprisingly good looking person, or their life stories being similar to ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, sometimes a friend or strong referral applies for the position. Instead of rationally assessing them and weighing pros and cons, we just search for information to confirm the initial assumption that they're a good candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of brevity – and the already mentioned lack of formal psychology &amp;amp; HR education – this section won't feature a list of biases, only a &lt;em&gt;strong recommendation&lt;/em&gt; for you to research more about it on reputable sources. Doing so will help you hire better and give you insights into some unconscious decisions you make every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind, and this is a suggestion I'm comfortable with making, try and have at least one more person with you when evaluating CVs and during meetings with candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be the same colleague pairing with you every time. Just having one more person sharing their thoughts about a candidate is a powerful tool to help both of you recognize and counter biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#take-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Take action
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I found myself in this unusual scenario where three engineers, out of five, left my team in the same month. Each of them had good reasons to do so, and I was happy that they could find new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; pleased about, though, is that my then team had some optimistic goals that were no longer attainable with two people instead of five. And to make things worse, the HR dept was notoriously slow and unresponsive. Some teams usually had to wait for months to meet with a promising candidate, things we're not looking good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully (or, should I say, &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt;), the company had a strong ownership and autonomy culture, so I convinced myself that by jumping over HR and handling recruiting all by myself, I'd be 100% aligned to the company expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's what I did. I still had a talk about compensation and benefits with HR – as a mere Team Lead, I didn't have &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; level of autonomy. Still, our agreement was that I would pick the candidates, and they would just work the final bureaucracy of hiring contracts, background checks and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for a couple of weeks, I didn't write a single &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; and devoted my time to writing job opening pages, headhunting, screening candidates, assessing tech skills, and doing all the communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that period, I went through HR material like I was reading the docs of a fascinating new framework. Whenever I was conflicted with a decision or unsure about how to proceed, there was good advice on the internet. Hiring is not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And things went surprisingly well! We hired three competent junior engineers with great cultural fit and still got to meet the quarter goals. I still catch myself wondering how we did it and feel content to have grabbed that bull but the horns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, if there's a moral to this anecdote, it is that sometimes the only way you can put a fire down is by dropping the firehose and finding some more firefighters to team up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remember-that-theres-more-to-a-good-engineer-than-raw-coding-skills"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remember that there's more to a good engineer than raw coding skills
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filtering candidates is a big, if not the most significant, part of recruiting. You want people to help you on a mission, and you want to pick the best among all applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes the "best" candidate varies a lot, though. Being super good with this week's stack is an obvious thing to notice, sure, but there are still many subtle and equally important skills to consider before deciding and who you'll hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, try and picture a talented engineer that can't communicate their thoughts clearly, either written or verbally. Or a super fast designer that works fantastically under supervision but lacks the self-motivation to keep pushing when no one is watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing great work nowadays requires a diverse skill-set, especially if we consider the remote work boom. You need people that: can work under little to no supervision, self-organize over a clear mission, collaborate well while being precise with their words, manages their time efficiently, and display strong emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which can be... Hard to find, yeah, but just like a person can be a junior in tech skills, you can expect them to be inexperienced with these so-called "soft skills". This is fine, a good manager/team lead should develop soft skills as much as they promote tech expertise among the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind that values like integrity, honesty, and respect are not negotiable and should be expected from the greenest intern to the most seasoned veteran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-it-all-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping it all up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm quite confident that you'll go from unstructured, chaotic hiring to a pretty darn good process by following these tips. Most of it might sound like straight-up common sense to experienced people, but trust me, the "me from the past" would've love to be taught some of those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that in mind, I'm 100% sure that I still have a lot to learn about it. I mean, hiring is a complex process with a lot of variation and moving parts, and everything I know is "derived from" and "limited to" my career as a frontend engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future reference, I have this (very well recommended) book on my reading list called "Scaling Teams" from Alexander and David Loftesness. I should be going through it shortly, so you can expect either a quick revision of this article or a new "lesson learned" article about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned and until next time. 👋&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 front end projects with design files to help you improve your HTML and CSS skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a designer who's relatively OK-ish at HTML and CSS. When I was starting out, though, I wasn't able to find designs that I wanted to code, and so I designed them and then coded them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took much time up and that's exactly why these templates are great for beginner developers looking to improve their HTML and CSS skills.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Freelancer vs. Company Employee</title>
      <author>Andrew Baisden</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 10:53:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/freelancer-vs-company-employee-5hep</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/freelancer-vs-company-employee-5hep</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important talking points for programmers is which path they want to go down. Do you want to be a freelancer or an employee that works for a company. Let's compare the two and see what the difference is between both of them. They both have their pros and cons however there is nothing stopping you from alternating between the two throughout your developer career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freelancers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Freelancers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancers are the type of people who are self employed. They often work with multiple clients as they are not tied down to a company structure where they would be expected to work on a few or less projects at a time. One of the defining qualities of a freelancer is having the freedom to do what ever you want and follow your own set of rules. Being your own boss comes with countless advantages as you are solely responsible for all the work that you do. You create and live to your own personal standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant difference between Freelancers and Employees is that Freelancers don't usually have a team of people that they work with. I suppose it could be compared to that of a lone wolf going off on their own and finding their own feet in the world. Freedom does lead to an increase in creativity though and with it comes many benefits such as remote working and setting your own work hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However with it comes downsides. For one Freelancers have to pay their own taxes and it is not quite as fun when you have to spend a long time sorting through all of your paperwork to make sure that you are getting paid the correct amount and dealing with all of the numbers. Company employees don't need to worry about any of this finance stuff as they have accounting and payroll departments that do all this stuff for them. All they have to do is work and they get paid weekly or monthly depending on what company they work for and the structure there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another drawback of being a Freelancer is that you don't get any company perks like bonuses, healthcare, company car or stocks... It is also a little bit more difficult to have protection and union rights like companies do. This was a problem recently because of the coronavirus when furloughed workers were still getting paid whereas self employed were left out to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#company-employees"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Company Employees
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company employees are permanent workers who get paid a fixed salary. Unlike Freelancers they have permanent employment where their income is guaranteed each month so long as they work for the company. In contrast Freelancers income is dependent on the work they get. If there is no work then they can go weeks or even months with no stable income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees also have scheduled work hours for the week where they are expected to either be in the office or remote working from home during those hours. Freelancers can work as much or as little as they want any day of the week including weekends. Company employees normally work week days only for office work although weekends can be an option too if overtime is required or if the job dictates that you should be available for weekends too. Like in the retail and restaurant industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are working as an employee at a company you will usually be working alongside other people in a team based atmosphere. Working in a team is a really great way to make new friends and collaborate on the projects that you work on. This is an area where Freelancers miss out because the job itself is for one person unless they outsource some of the work to others. But as a plus Freelancers are not required to work overtime whereas employees might have to do so and without extra pay because they don't have an hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perks and bonuses can be included within the contract itself and you have a team based learning environment where you can get help from your colleagues if you find yourself stuck on a problem. The ability to have more than one brain trying to solve a problem makes it far easier to troubleshot issues. Compare that with a Freelancer who could often be stuck on a problem for hours that could have been solved within minutes with help from a team member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever path you choose to go down know that you are going to learn something new either way. If you want to have as much flexibility and freedom as possible then go down the freelancer route. However if you need stability in your life and colleagues that have your back then working for a company is a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope that you enjoyed reading this article and learned something from it. As a content creator and technical writer I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping other people reach their goals.

      <title>Jumping on the Crypto Train</title>
      <author>Aditya</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 10:51:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/adityavinodh/jumping-on-the-crypto-train-51kp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adityavinodh/jumping-on-the-crypto-train-51kp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LdVuPkRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3q1q2ejukyejk8oioa5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LdVuPkRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3q1q2ejukyejk8oioa5.jpg" alt="Banner Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a cryptocurrency?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies are a form of a completely digital currency. You might think it is similar to online banking, or credit or debit cards, but all of these methods still involve a middle man - your bank or card providers. Cryptocurrencies use a technology called the blockchain to completely get rid of any third person. You can directly make transactions with whoever you want, in a secure manner, without involving any other person. There are a few popular examples of these digital currencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the recently trending Dogecoin. Bitcoin was the first major, successful attempt at a cryptocurrency, and the following currencies that were created using similar technology (but with minor differences), are called altcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the blockchain?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not too important to know the specifics, but most cryptocurrencies rely on this technology to function. In simple terms, the blockchain is a chronological ledger or chain of data that is updated and synchronised across multiple computers across the internet. Every transaction is public, including the unique identification for both parties involved in the transaction, and the amount transfered. There is a complex cryptographic task that the computers must solve and agree on. This is why every transaction takes around a few minutes or sometimes hours to get approved and verified. Due to this design, the data or transactions can never be "hacked" or changed. It is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O8BqpKBZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.slalom.com%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252Finline-images%252Fblockchain-diagram-2-100.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O8BqpKBZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.slalom.com%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252Finline-images%252Fblockchain-diagram-2-100.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="Blockchain Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use it?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is meant to be a replacement for traditional currencies, but it is far from becoming widely adopted. To actually use these cryptocurrencies, you first need a wallet. This can be a physical hardware wallet that you can buy, or a digital wallet that you can download, like a mobile app. Using an app as a wallet is the easiest, and is what I recomment. You can use an app like &lt;a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/"&gt;Coinbase Wallet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://metamask.io/"&gt;Metamask&lt;/a&gt;. You need to buy and trade cryptocurrencies from an exchange. Make sure to do your research and use a reliable one. You can use your bank account or credit/debit card to purchase the cryptocurrency of your choice. For beginners, I recommend something like &lt;a href="https://uphold.com/"&gt;Uphold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com/"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; (Different from Coinbase Wallet). Once you are done with the purchase, these exchanges usually provide a hosted wallet which is where your crypto will be stored. It is okay to leave it there, but it is usually recommended to transfer it to a separate wallet for security reasons. So, from the hosted wallet on one of these exchanges, you can transfer the cryptocurrency to your own wallet (something like Metamask), or even withdraw it to your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fees-and-costs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fees and costs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact fees and cost of the transactions will vary depending on which exchange you use, but most exchanges, especially new ones, have a 0% commission and fees policy for transfering from one crypto to another, and sometimes for also buying. But you often have to pay a network fee when withdrawing to a bank account or transfering to your or someone else's wallet. This fees depends on the network, and is often called network fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-to-consider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Things to consider
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#purpose-of-the-cryptocurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Purpose of the cryptocurrency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every currency is created with a specific purpose in mind. Consider this while making a decision to purchase or invest in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and Ethereum for example, are very popular currencies, but are also quite slow compared to other altcoins. It takes longer for transactions to complete, and have high network fees. It is okay if you are planning to make a long term investment, but it is usually not recommended for small, frequent transactions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (Not Bitcoin (BTC)) is an example of an altcoin which is a fork from Bitcoin. It was made in order to be fast and scalable, and has a much lower network fee than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency-networks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency networks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple cryptocurrencies or tokens can use the same network to operate and function. Bitcoin uses the bitcoin network, ehtereum uses the ethereum network, Basic Attention Token (BAT - Used by the Brave browser) also uses the ethereum network, and Bitcoin Cash uses its own Bitcoin Cash network. The network used by the currency or token is important to consider, because it determines if you can convert it to another token, and how much network fees you will need to pay. Certain wallets like the Coinbase Wallet, only allow you to convert tokens to others if they use the Ethereum Network, other tokens can be stored and used, but not be converted to other forms.&lt;/p&gt;

  Should you use it?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, and therefore have a high risk. The value of your tokens can drastically change everyday, and thus pose a problem to be used as a daily currency. But, if you want to explore and try it out, its definitely something to dig deeper into. I would recommend to start with $10 - $15 as it is mostly the minimum amount required for the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the Brave browser, which I highly recommend, you get paid for watching optional advertisements that are completely privacy focused. You get paid in BAT (Basic Attention Token) which is based on the Ethereum Network. You can link it with an Uphold account. Once you reach a sufficient balance, you can transfer it to your own wallet. No credit/debit cards are required.&lt;/p&gt;

  NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFTs stands for Non Fungible Tokens. These are getting a lot of hype recently, and are in simple terms, a digital collectible. Its like collecting stamps or coins, but a digital version of that. They are also based on the blockchain, and help people purchase unique, non-replacable digital items, like a Tweet, an image, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
