      <title>The Importance of Self-Advocacy for Career Advancement</title>
      <author>Nahrin Jalal</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-importance-of-self-advocacy-for-career-advancement-2nh6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-importance-of-self-advocacy-for-career-advancement-2nh6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year marks five years (!) since I &lt;a href="https://dev.to/nahrinjalal/the-one-where-i-share-my-journey-to-tech-anj"&gt;started my career in the tech industry&lt;/a&gt;. To commemorate the milestone, I want to share a practice that has played a monumental role in my career advancement over this time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent self-advocacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I so often tell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NahrinJalal/status/1050078722605416450"&gt;my students&lt;/a&gt; how imperative it is to share their accomplishments and elevate their visibility regularly. A lot goes into this, such as weekly accomplishment tracking, connecting your achievements to compensation, scheduling weekly meetings with your manager, collecting testimonials, and more. However, the most repeated blocker I hear is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don't know how to tell their story effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories have three parts: a problem, a solution, and a result. If you accomplished something at work recently, you likely had to go through all three of those phases to that point. So now it's time to think about yourself as the protagonist of this story and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crafting-your-story" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Crafting Your Story
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, reflect on a professional accomplishment that you're proud ofâ€”ideally one that took place recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, answer these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenge did you overcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you break into a new industry or find success with a difficult client? What is the headline of your story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight your contribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly share how &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; solution addressed the issue. How were your strengths and passions essential?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the business impact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did you make money or save money for the company? Did you contribute to innovation, revenue, growth, or culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to keep your story short! Your final result should be about 3-4 sentences (or bullet points) long. Your manager doesn't have time to read an essay, but she will appreciate and remember your impact if she can quickly understand how you solved a problem for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, bear in mind that not every key accomplishment may fit into this storytelling structure. Please still share those other accomplishments with your managerâ€”ensuring that you're still effectively highlighting how you impacted the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it all boils down to how you made a difference. Be proud of what you have achieved and share your accomplishments widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#seek-support-when-you-need-it" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Seek Support When You Need It
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-advocacy is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling, remember that you are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the only one feeling this way, and it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; get easier with practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, never think you need to go it alone. Reach out to a mentor. Vent to a trusted friend. Let this incredible community support you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Most Recent Achievement Was...</title>
      <author>Debra-Kaye Elliott</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 14:55:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/my-most-recent-achievement-was-1al2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/my-most-recent-achievement-was-1al2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a year of lows, highs and more lows. To say challenging would be putting it mildly. The struggles continue. Nevertheless, I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of the lows, the highs I achieved were both unexpected and amazing ðŸ’™:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My first tech blog post &lt;a href="https://dev.to/debrakayeelliott/navigating-the-world-of-web-development-4eao"&gt;Navigating the World of Web Development&lt;/a&gt; relating to so many others in the dev community on this journey &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the Virtual Coffee community that's so supportive of where I am and encourage me to never give up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being featured by CodeNewbie for the &lt;a href="https://community.codenewbie.org/codenewbie/debra-kaye-elliott-the-go-getter-43mh"&gt;February 2021 Community Member Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, my biggest achievement ever! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey is not one to be navigated alone. It has been challenging. It has been demotivating, more times than I care to admit. It has made me feel like I'm not progressing. This is why participating in the right communities is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; important. The right people will meet you where you are and not judge you, will help you through your struggles, help you learn, encourage you to keep going and celebrate your wins with you. The saying goes "Surround yourself with positive and uplifting people," and those are the only types of people I want in my circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest goal is to be the best developer I can be, and work with great people in a supportive environment. A developer will do great work and grow in an environment where they're supported, their voice is heard, their team listens, they feel valued and are celebrated. That's where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been more than a challenging journey. Nevertheless, I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing with discomfort. Change.</title>
      <author>Holger Blank</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/s2engineers/dealing-with-discomfort-change-3boo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely, if ever, talk or write about my personal journey in public. Mainly because I feel uncomfortable while doing so. Time to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time as a co-organizer of tech-community events  like &lt;a href="https://jsconf.eu"&gt;JSConf EU&lt;/a&gt; and others for the last 10+ years I had the opportunity to listen and learn a lot. But as I figured out really soon, I also had the need to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn't been that one single event that helped me to see the undeniable structural facts of our unequal society and workplaces around me. I learned, slowly, over years. I was able to see things clearer over time. Most of the time I felt uncomfortable with a lot of things I've seen and learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my personal journey, as a highly privileged white-male, I was lucky to have a group of people around me that helped me to reflect the situation, making me feel uncomfortable, developing my views including also co-creating small things that hopefully made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'm glad that the team I'm working with most of the time, is not only incredibly open for change but also drives a lot of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raffaele (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixari"&gt;@pixari&lt;/a&gt;) from our Munich based team wrote an incredible article about his journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest spending 11 minutes reading that one (not only) to every of my male colleagues. I also propose to spend many more minutes following all the links he has collected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__link"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/pixari" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/s2engineers/step-up-listen-up-shut-up-50ca" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Step up. Listen up. Shut up.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Raffaele Pizzari ãƒ» Mar  3 ãƒ» 11 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#shecodedally&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#genderequality&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#choosetochallenge&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The next post I recommend reading is from Feli (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kotzendekrabbe"&gt;@kotzendekrabbe&lt;/a&gt;). Feli and me first met at JSConf EU 2015, since 2016 we're working together. Since then, Feli made me feel uncomfortable more than once. I'm thankful for every single time!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="/s2engineers/nevertheless-feli-coded-choosetochallenge-yourself-4enn" class="ltag__link__link"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__link__content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Nevertheless, Feli Coded - ChooseToChallenge Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Feli (she/her) ãƒ» Mar  4 ãƒ» 3 min read&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__link__taglist"&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#shecoded&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#womenintech&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#choosetochallenge&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="ltag__link__tag"&gt;#career&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becoming uncomfortable is always my starting point for change. And it could become yours too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest not only to allow others to make you feel uncomfortable, but creating a culture where everybody is aware of their unearned privileges and is fostering a culture where being confronted is valued as a joint and common starting point of change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>She Coded, 2021</title>
      <author>Laurie</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/laurieontech/she-coded-2021-1d0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/laurieontech/she-coded-2021-1d0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn't sure if I wanted to write one of these this year. If you're on twitter you may know that last week was full of bad sexist takes that were incredibly demoralizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it's tradition. Once a year, I walk away from tutorials and tech posts, and I write about all the things I don't normally choose or want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I want to take about lived experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all move through the world a bit differently. Yet we all have similar experiences as humans. Those may seem like conflicting statements, but they're not. And it's more important than ever that we understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I move through this industry as a white woman. There is inherent challenge in that to be sure. Some of which I didn't truly experience until this year, for myriad reasons. And having that experience diminished or ignored is hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I share a story of discrimination, however well-intended, a man telling me what to do differently next time is unhelpful. They're telling me what they would do, what would work for them. But they've never experienced this industry as I do. And what works for them won't work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm a white woman. So that means there are just as many experiences of discrimination and harm caused by this industry that I have not experienced. And my advice does not belong in those conversations. Because I don't know how to navigate the experience of a Black woman, or a disabled woman, or so many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job is to believe those experiences. Full stop. To listen, to learn, to find ways to advocate with the voice and privilege I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discrimination exists on a spectrum. I expect those who don't experience sexism to listen to my lived experiences. To believe me. To learn from me. But intersectionality is everything. And I have a lot to learn too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding may be for machines, but this industry is full of people. And we have a long way to go until everyone has the same experiences and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

  My name is just Sharon, I do not have any nicknames(at least that I know of)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-do-you-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where do you work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Braun Group &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work as an Innovation and Business Development Manager at B. Braun Group, a healthcare company that manufactures medical devices and solutions. My job entails identifying internal and external innovative ideas which we can develop into new products to protect and improve the health of people across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My high school Physics teacher inspired me to study engineering at the University. Since then, I've had an incredibly supportive network of mentors who have influenced the changes in my career path to what I'm doing today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-your-favourite-music-genre" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is your favourite music genre?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My playlist has a little bit of everything - from Jazz to traditional Luhya music. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, never stop learning. Stay curious and updated in your field.&lt;br&gt;
Second, it is okay to have a non-linear career path. Keep an open mind and always be on the look out for new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-keep-yourself-up-to-date-in-your-field" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you keep yourself up to date in your field?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read - a lot! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-would-you-describe-your-job-to-a-bunch-of-5-year-olds" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find new companies which can be friends with my company, and we can all play together and make cool products that help sick people feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently supporting the roll out of our new company strategy. It's exciting to see how a company that was founded over 180 years ago is adopting new technology and preparing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an ICT4D Intern at a Community Knowledge Centre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-toughest-challenges-youve-had-at-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming Imposter Syndrome and learning to negotiate and advocate for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are dramatically changing the Healthcare industry, from enabling early detection to AI-assisted surgeries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to pick one - but I'd say everyone needs to pay as much attention to their soft skills as they do to their technical skills. Emotional intelligence, great communication skills and creative problem solving skills will get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I have. I quit my job to move to a new country for a 1 year fellowship program that had no guaranteed future after that. It did pay off. I experienced a lot of growth over the one year, and the work that I did during the fellowship built a foundation for a new job with the same company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-we-follow-you" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can we follow you?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you do?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Founder/CEO of GlobalX Investments/GlobalX Innovation Labs based in Nairobi, Kenya.  GlobalX's vision is to drive a more diverse, inclusive and competitive digital economy with a focus on emerging technologies, that opens up equal opportunities for all.  Our main purpose is to use technology to provide solutions for businesses and for social impact. GlobalX provides opportunities for children, youth, developers &amp;amp; entrepreneurs/businesses to learn, innovate, and scale up their knowledge in hardware and emerging technologies. In a nutshell, GlobalX feeds into the innovation pipeline by closing the skills, funding and organisational/corporate digital transformation gaps. GlobalX focuses on SDGs 4 (Quality Education);5 (Gender Equality);8 (Decent Work &amp;amp; Economic Growth); 9 (Industry, Innovation &amp;amp; Infrastructure; 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 17 (Partnerships for the goals).I am also passionate about empowering Women in Tech and contributing to the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Africa and globally. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love working in tech because first, I like to make positive impact in society through innovations. Secondly, I get bored easily, so I like to do stuff that keeps me engaged and allows me to try different things, discover and keep learning. Being in tech allows me to do this. I always look forward to creating or being part of teams that create solutions for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-your-favourite-music-genre" class="anchor"&gt;

  What is the best advice you can give to someone who just started their career?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe in yourself and seek all the support you require to succeed, but you must be ready to knock many doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you keep yourself up to date in your field?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read widely, speak at and also curate/hold tech events.&lt;/p&gt;

  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of, seen, built or learnt how to build robots? Coded using scratch? Heard of, seen or built a drone or best still flown one? My work involves helping build or giving guidance/teaching individuals or companies to build or do these type of things. My work also involves helping people who create these things start/run businesses, just like the shopkeeper where you buy bread from runs their shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working on an initiative that aims to increase the representation of women in Artificial Intelligence. This was born out of my participation in the ITCILO AI Lab between Aug-Nov 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related innovations are definitely the industry game changer. It is estimated that by 2030, AI will contribute $15.7 Trillion to the global GDP, making it the biggest commercial opportunity in todayâ€™s fast changing economy. AI basically refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. From disease mapping and prediction tools; song or TV show recommendations from Spotify and Netflix; conversational bots for customer support and marketing; to delivery of blood to remote locations that would be typically hard-to-reach, AI has definitely had a major contribution so far and continues to. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;

  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I have-getting into entrepreneurship. It has paid off especially in terms of impact, growing my professional brand as well as making me learn about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Software Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-or-what-inspired-you-to-pursue-the-career-you-have-today" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guy named Arthur Kennedy is the who introduced me to coding and opened up my mind about technology. His patience and brilliance made me want to be more like him. I am really grateful to him for that and the amazing ladies from Rails Girls Mombasa and Nairobi who we not only gave each other hope in our coding journey but took up the challenge to teach and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-your-favourite-music-genre" class="anchor"&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid, allow yourself to make mistakes that is how you learn, ask the dumb questions and be very patient with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-keep-yourself-up-to-date-in-your-field" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you keep yourself up to date in your field?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to read tech blogs, follow tech blogs on twitter, I recently started picking coding challenges on exercism and hackerrank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-would-you-describe-your-job-to-a-bunch-of-5-year-olds" class="anchor"&gt;

  How would you describe your job to a bunch of 5 year olds
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the apps you use on the internet? I build thoseðŸ˜Ž.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-cool-thing-are-you-working-on-right-now" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What cool thing are you working on right now?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently worked on implementing a feature that allows you to link your your forms from ona to Tableau for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-your-first-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was your first job?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does an intern count? I am currently at my first job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-toughest-challenges-youve-had-at-work" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the toughest challenges you've had at work?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started out as an intern, I had to learn a new language within the three months. It was also my first time working on code that goes to production. It was the toughest yet the best experience ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-upcoming-technological-innovation-will-dramatically-impact-the-industry-in-the-next-five-years" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What upcoming technological innovation will dramatically impact the industry in the next five years?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe machine learning and robotics is something people will  embrace even more. 2020 has made us realize we don't really need to be at the same place to get things done therefore dependence on machines will increase as we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skill-do-you-think-everyone-should-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skill do you think everyone should learn?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;critical thinking. You might be a good developer but if you can't think how to implement your code, you will stay at the same place. As my mentor says, coding is easy as long as you know what you are coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#have-you-taken-a-huge-leap-of-faith-at-work-did-it-pay-off" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think pick up features or new technologies at work is always a leap of faith for me. Sometimes I might take longer to even deliver but my end goal is not to just complete but to come out better and with knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-we-follow-you" class="anchor"&gt;

  Who or what inspired you to pursue the career you have today?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by tech ever since I was a kid. I particularly chose to pursue a software engineering career because I loved how it gave me the opportunity to solve problems as well as create things that are important for humanity. I also love how versatile my career is, especially because I am that person who enjoys exploring new things, hence as a software engineer, I  am able to do a lot of different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am excited about finally launching  a program that I have always wanted to start. It will be a mentor-ship program for women in stem. I have always wanted to empower other women and it means a lot to me that I am finally going to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  Have you taken a huge leap of faith at work? Did it pay off?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. I had a Perl web scraper that I needed to update. It was old, ugly, messy. It used xml and wsdl, which I hadn't worked with before. But it really helped me understand a lot and learn a new language&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/t/shecoded"&gt;#SheCoded&lt;/a&gt; initiative from DEV and I've been involved for 4 years now. I just looked up what I shared in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lauragift21/nevertheless-egwuenu-gift-coded--54ka"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lauragift21/nevertheless-egwuenu-gift-coded-27a4"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lauragift21/nevertheless-gift-egwuenu-coded-1h52"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm very happy to see my growth in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this year is no different. I'm quite happy with what I've done so far even with the obstacles and challenges that I face every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent achievement was when I got the award for MVP in developer technologies from Microsoft MVP Program.&lt;/p&gt;

      I became a Microsoft MVP this week. Feels so unreal to be awarded this..while I'm waiting on the plague to get to me here's an official announcement. Very proud of myself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/FBgBo6lMSV"&gt;mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicPrâ€¦&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This was a huge deal for me because it makes me feel like the work I put into creating value for developers is being recognized and celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocating for myself means always showing up, putting my work out there as I've learned if you don't advocate for yourself no one else will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Put yourself and your work out there every day and you'll start meeting some amazing people." â€” Bobby Solomon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest goal is to be the best version of my version in everything I do. In my work as a developer, in contributing back to the community and navigating my passion for content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know when it's right to step in and help pivot our voices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support and Donate to Women-led non-profit organizations: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/FrontEndFoxes"&gt;Frontend Foxes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.shecodeafrica.org/donate"&gt;She Code Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.com/donations.html"&gt;Black Girls Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love being in Tech and I'm excited to do even more as long as I'm here!&lt;/p&gt;
