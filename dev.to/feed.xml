  What is Live Streaming?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5Wswp3JR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://blog.videosdk.live/content/images/2021/07/video-conf-vs-live-streaming.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5Wswp3JR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://blog.videosdk.live/content/images/2021/07/video-conf-vs-live-streaming.jpg" alt="Live Streaming vs Video Conferencing"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live streaming refers to the concept of streaming digital video content over the internet. On a Live stream technology, one can watch, create, and share videos content online. It needs an internet connection, a smartphone, or a PC to enable the live streaming activity on a device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an aid to big corporates and small businesses for branding, marketing, and advancement. Live streaming has become a modern technology to make a digital presence in the community. In contemporary living, going digital is the only way out to make a successful existence. Even live streaming has today been popular with gaming, content creation, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live streaming happens to broadcast media online over several social media platforms. A live streamer, at once can stream content over multiple platforms increasing reach with broader visibility. A live stream is organized by a host who invites the viewers to his streaming session. A live stream allows comment and chat facility on an ongoing streaming session. It also allows a huge number of viewers to participate in the stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live streaming is telecasted with a delay or lag of 5 to 10 seconds for the viewers. It is encoded in different resolutions, enabling the support for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS) and the good part is that live streaming can be recorded for viewing later using the VoD facility, allowing video playback. It is a boon that with unstable internet connectivity too the streaming on our device doesn’t stop, as it adjusts the viewing quality of the video. Unfortunately, if a viewer faces disconnection, live streaming is a benefit in this case, as it allows playback of the recorded stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction | videosdk.live Documentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live streming lets you stream your live videos with just few lines of code. Reach to your audience across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#what-is-video-conferencing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Video Conferencing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video conferencing is a technology that allows meeting in closed groups with close people. Video conferencing is today a prominent mode of communication in corporate houses. Video conferencing allows connecting people from all around the world on a single screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video conferencing connects people over a low latency video and audio transmission over IP. It allows talk and chat features over conferencing where people can be verbally communicative and can discuss and generate solutions. A video conference generally has limited participants, who are the ones invited by the host. Generally, video conferencing systems are secured with passcodes initiated by the host for the participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video conferencing system provides no lag in the delivery of messages to the participants. Under low latency streaming, video conferencing often causes participants a glitch, in case of poor connectivity. When a participant of a conference faces a power cut or a disconnection, the conference immediately stops for him. Concerning, he cannot view the previous discussions. A video conference can only be streamed on-demand when it is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction | videosdk.live Documentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-time comunication SDK is built with blend of webRTC and optimised UDP protocol. Our SDK helps developers to add real-time audio and video calls to any mobile app or web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the blog explain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog explains how live streaming contrasts with video conferencing. Both live streaming and video conferencing are real-time technologies. These are the modern technologies of the digitally trending community. Beyond par, we are increasingly consuming these forefront advancements. They have been among the most useful communication tools in recent times. In this blog, we will learn how these technologies have their pros and cons and how they are similar to and different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live streaming - Pros and Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A huge number of participants can join a live stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A live stream also works in an unstable internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows the video playback option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A live stream can be recorded in HD quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It supports on-demand services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A live stream supports streaming over multiple platforms at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports screen sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two-way communication is difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not support participants’ visibility to the host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chat box is available only for comments
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video conferencing - Pros and cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible two-way communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports screen sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allotted space for participants’ visibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saves time and money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy scheduling of meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time communication without lags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limited number of participants can join&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor video quality in case of unstable internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited streaming platform support
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarities between live streaming and video conferencing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Live-action:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the technologies work on live platforms. They stream the content live to the viewers, where the viewers can chat and converse to bring out conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Involvement of participants:&lt;/strong&gt; These technologies are designed to draw maximum engagement. Participants are allowed to join the stream with their audio and video by the hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Screenshare:&lt;/strong&gt; Both live streaming and video conferencing allow screen sharing options, displaying pre-recorded content and images to the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Chat features:&lt;/strong&gt; These technologies allow chat options for the participants in ongoing streaming. The participants can comment/converse with the host via chatbox.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissimilarities between live streaming and video conferencing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Viewer screen space-&lt;/strong&gt; Live streaming does not allow viewers to share screen space with the live streamer. One can only communicate via chat. Whereas in video conferencing, the participants have an allotted box where they can be seen as well as can see the other participants in the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility-&lt;/strong&gt; Live streaming is accessible to a huge number of viewers at once, also on different platforms. Whereas, in video conferencing, only limited participants are allowed into the meeting, making it a kind of closed group meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Communication ease-&lt;/strong&gt; There is an ease of communication with video conferencing due to a limited audience in the meeting, where everyone can put their points to conclude. In a live stream, no conclusion can be derived as it is merely a stream where people can only watch certain content and comment on the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scalability-&lt;/strong&gt; A live stream is encoded in several resolutions to make it available in a manageable quality for each device type and its connectivity. Whereas in video conferencing, the video outcome becomes poor due to low latency.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-better-option"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a better option?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both video conferencing and live streaming have their benefits and different use cases. It all depends on one’s need for the time. All you need is a mobile device and an internet connection whenever you think of using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, a company has launched a product for which it is looking for a public announcement, and also to increase its branding and market value. In this case, the company opts for live streaming where it makes an announcement that gets into the knowledge of millions of viewers. The company excels in its strategy with live streaming. In the same situation, if the company opts for video conferencing, it may convey its product to only some thousands of people, which also tends to be costly as well as gives a low reach to the product. These states live streaming to be a better option for announcements and huge engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for instance, if a company has to make some decisions with the team, which does not require external public at all. In this case, the company opts for video conferencing. The foremost reason is that video conferencing technology works in real-time, where the messages are delivered instantly to the receiver. This technology also keeps a window for each participant, which leads to the active participation of each one during the meet. Video conferencing is favorably a better option for small group communication, where the general external public is not kept as an ideal viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While some digital marketers are still discovering the power of social media, those who are on the cutting edge of technological progress are raising awareness about chatbots and how to build a bot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f646"&gt;The rapid rise of chatbots has been made possible thanks to the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Younger generations of consumers, who have grown up with at least one chat window permanently opened, find it natural to communicate with their favorite brands and companies through interactive messenger chatbots that mimic real conversations with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28af"&gt;By integrating chatbots with e-commerce platforms, it’s possible to monetize existing social media accounts by helping consumers find products or offering personalized recommendations based on their instant messaging profiles and personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Considerations in Building Enclaves for Multiparty Computation (Part 1)</title>
      <author>Jack F.</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 11:16:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/oblivious/considerations-in-building-enclaves-for-multiparty-computation-part-1-nc0</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/oblivious/considerations-in-building-enclaves-for-multiparty-computation-part-1-nc0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a short overview of some of the qualitative considerations you may want to take into account when designing and building multiparty computation protocols on secure enclaves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input privacy or multiparty computation is a general term to describe software that combines sensitive input from multiple sources to produce an output, without revealing any parties' sensitive data to one another. As an example, let’s imagine there are two companies, Bank A and Insurance Company B, who wish to collaborate on a new product for their customers. An obvious first question may be to ask, who exactly are our shared customers in terms of their interests and demographics. Needless to say, neither the bank nor insurance company would be willing to hand over their customer lists to one another, so their two options are to find a trusted third party who can broker the transaction or perform some sort of multiparty computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the term multiparty computation was specific to purely cryptographic protocols. In particular, homomorphic encryption, which has received a lot of attention from cryptographers since Craig Gentry’s 2009 thesis on Fully Homomorphic Encryption, is often used as a primitive in many multiparty computation protocols. Nevertheless, purely cryptographic protocols have their pros and minuses. They are ultimately the most secure approach if they are designed and implemented correctly. However, there are currently no normative standards available (only informative ISOs and guidelines by community groups) and to the best of our knowledge at the time of writing this, only one company has managed to get FIPS certification which is a slow and expensive process. We have no doubt the users of this technology will ultimately have to foot the bill for this process which may be prohibitive unless it becomes ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach to multiparty computation is to use a trusted execution environment, or specifically a Secure Enclave. There are broadly two types of secure enclaves, a fully hardware-based enclave such as Intel's SGX chips or a software-defined enclave such as AWS Nitro Enclaves. The former has a security model based on physical interventions while the latter leverages the same technology used for multi-tenancy cloud environments (virtual machines running via EC2s for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these two technologies do broadly speaking the same functionality from the perspective of the developer. They run your code in an isolated environment with very limited IO. Importantly they attest the code that is running inside the enclave via a cryptographic hash of the program. This attestation, in turn, is used to “prove” to a key management service that the enclave is safe to share decryption keys with. This means two or more parties can encrypt their data separately and send it into an enclave. Only when inside the enclave will the data be decrypted and a pre-agreed program can perform some computation on the data. Equally, data can be encrypted before sending it back out of the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#planning-the-enclaves-functionality-the-ideal-functionality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Planning the Enclaves Functionality: The Ideal Functionality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with writing code. Whether your language of choice is C, Python, Rust, or PHP (to name a few) the paradigm itself is pretty much the same at a high level. You declare variables, functions, and maybe classes and describe how they interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, building an enclave application is simply writing code. However, it differs from the perspective of how the code perceived from different parties' viewpoints. Cryptographers use the term ideal functionalities to describe this. Basically, it boils down to how, in an ideal world, would the system work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can break this down further and ask ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the parties involved in the computation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What inputs do each of them provide and what outputs do they receive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What order do inputs and outputs get sent to the trusted execution environment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What calculation does the trusted execution environment perform?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What code, parameters or arguments does the trusted execution promise to all parties?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first important step in building any enclave application is to make sure you thoroughly understand the above questions and their answers, and ultimately that the ideal functionality is fit for purpose. Ideal functionalities are often implemented in practice and one needs to be extremely pedantic about exactly what each party learns about each other's secret inputs and outputs. This is compounded when sensitive information is used more than once and privacy loss is compounded. Theoretical frameworks such as UC and AC Composability must be leveraged to keep track of the leakage of sensitive information if there is any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a very simple example. Assume we have three parties, namely Alice, Bob, and Charlie, with secret inputs A, B, and C respectively. Further, let us assume these are all integer values between 0-10, and a priori the best guess they could make about each other's values is purely random (a uniform distribution over 0-10). Let’s assume our enclave returns A+B+C to Alice and both Bob and Charlie receive no output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did Alice learn? Well, she learned only a single number, the sum of all three sensitive inputs. So she doesn’t know exactly what Bob or Charlie’s values are. But that doesn’t mean she learned nothing about their inputs. If Alice’s value was 5 and the total she received was 12, then it has actually changed her guessing probability over Bob and Charlie’s values (neither can be over 7 in this example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in this trivial example Alice’s guessing probability of Bob and Charlie’s input was simply a truncation of possible values, in real-world applications it typically changes her distribution of uncertainty. These information leaks can easily compound in unintuitive ways and quickly Alice’s best guess at Bob and Charlie’s inputs can become very likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately all parties in a multiparty computation have to accept the security definition involved and this will very much depend on their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#coming-up-in-part-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coming Up in Part 2:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we will discuss security considerations in implementations on AWS Nitro.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trine about robots, her home on wheels and consistent work 🤖🚐💻</title>
      <author>Annika_H</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/s2engineers/trine-about-robots-her-home-on-wheels-and-consistent-work-6h5</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-are-you-what-are-you-doing-how-did-you-get-to-where-you-are-now-tell-me-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who are you, what are you doing, how did you get to where you are now? Tell me everything!😁
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm Trine, person of undefined gender, people are free to use whichever pronouns they want. I live in my house on wheels with my pug Billy. I'm a web developer trainee at SinnerSchrader in Berlin. I moved to Berlin about 12 years ago when I was 20 and spent many years in random jobs that paid the bills, but didn't bring me any joy. I never lasted long in any of them. I started an apprenticeship to become a carpenter, I applied to costume design at UDK, I went to Australia for a bit, I worked in several different customer and tech support jobs. I once spent 4 months on a stop motion short film, I think it has reached around 200 views on YouTube so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of consistency in my past, as you can see, but that changed a few years ago when I joined a one year web development course at DCI in Berlin. This shift from random jobs to something very specific was so exciting and I remember being super motivated by the fact that I could specialize in something without having to go to university for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the course I joined SinnerSchrader in June 2020. I loved it from day one, everything was new to me and I was learning so much every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we were also in the middle of a pandemic. I still lived in a flat in Berlin back then, but I was struggling more and more with all the restrictions and very limited social life. So in September last year I bought a van with "Kofferaufbau". With tons of support and understanding from work, friends and family I was able to take three months off work to go to my dad's place where him and I built my house on wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work is now the consistent thing in my life and my house is moving all the time. I think this was a healthy shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sounds-like-you-really-mastered-worklifebalance-what-do-you-like-most-about-your-job"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sounds like you really mastered work-life-balance!😁 What do you like most about your job?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's such a cliché, but I love solving problems! I don't know a better way to describe it. When I need to build something it can be a struggle to break it into smaller pieces, but once everything has it's own frame I can lose myself for hours, just solving one problem after the other. And I also love that technology keeps evolving which means there will always be new things to learn. This motivates me a lot. I want my life to be an adventure and if I'm able to have a job that's also an adventure - I couldn't ask for more :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sounds-dreamy-but-there-have-to-be-challenges-too-right-what-has-been-the-biggest-challenge-so-far-and-how-did-you-face-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sounds dreamy. But there have to be challenges, too, right? What has been the biggest challenge so far and how did you face it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I sometimes lose overview! I've learned how important it is to me, that things are clearly defined. I get very distracted if there are lots of vaguely defined goals, tasks, expectations etc, it makes me feel overwhelmed and confused. I've learned that, if it's not already provided in e.g. subtasks, I have to start everything with setting up a "frame", something that helps me understand where my focus should be. If it's a task at work and the description isn't completely clear to me, I start out by defining my own frame. I also try to use this to structure my days, which of course isn't always possible due to team work, meetings etc. But this has helped me to get less overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-envision-your-future-do-you-have-a-plan-or-are-you-more-relaxed-about-everything-to-come"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you envision your future? Do you have a plan or are you more relaxed about everything to come?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my vision: The robots have become even more advanced and are taking over many of the human tasks. This at first leads to (even) more unemployment, but luckily the humans soon realize that this is an opportunity to reduce the work hours for everybody. Unemployment falls, well-being rises. Everybody is happy. Besides that I don't really have any plans, I don't even know where I will be living next week. I only know that I have found a job that makes me happy and that I want to continue improving and learning new skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interesting-vison-tell-me-if-you-could-choose-to-do-anything-you-like-for-a-living-what-would-it-be"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interesting vison! Tell me, if you could choose to do anything you like for a living, what would it be?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another cliché: this, this is my dream job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm so happy with my colleagues, the culture and of course the job itself. But if this is too boring, here's my alternative:&lt;br&gt;
I would like to befriend a very rich person who doesn't have any ideas. I have many ideas, but unfortunately not enough resources to make them all happen. So if my new friend would grant me access to their bank account, I would also like to do that for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS transform : complete guide on CSS transform. Everything you need for good developer</title>
      <author>Modern Web</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:52:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kunaal438/css-transform-everything-you-need-for-a-good-developer-4obc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kunaal438/css-transform-everything-you-need-for-a-good-developer-4obc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, welcome. In today's article we'll learn about CSS transform properties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS transform is used to change shapes, scale the element, rotate it and much more. Let's see some transform properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css-transform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CSS transform
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#syntax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Syntax
&lt;/h6&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is how we use css transform. Let's see some of it's value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#translate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Translate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translate value is used to change element's position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;translateX(px) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to place element in X axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;translateY(px) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to place element in Y axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;translateZ(px) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to place element in Z axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;translate(x,y) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a short form for translateX and translateY&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;translate3d(x,y,z) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a short form for translateX, translateY and translateZ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PlbWbs7V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tkbkgh1fkc2ik20u1cw5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PlbWbs7V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tkbkgh1fkc2ik20u1cw5.png" alt="Frame 1 (2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scale
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scale is used to scale element in x, y, z axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scaleX(px) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to scale element in X axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scaleY(px) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to scale element in Y axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scaleZ(px) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to scale element in Z axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scale(x,y) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a short form for scaleX and scaleY&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;scale3d(x,y,z) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a short form for scaleX, scaleY and scaleZ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---D4l7eRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2wvny7iwo0b1di1035qa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---D4l7eRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2wvny7iwo0b1di1035qa.png" alt="Translate"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rotate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rotate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotate value is used to rotate element's position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rotate(deg) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It is used to rotate element in 2d dimension&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rotateX(deg) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to rotate element in X axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rotateY(deg) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to rotate element in Y axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;rotate3d(x,y,z) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a short form for rotateX, rotateY and rotateZ&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rDOvrDOQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3fqujn46uc3fmiwhryz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rDOvrDOQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3fqujn46uc3fmiwhryz.png" alt="Translate (2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RotateX and RotateY value will behave like scale if you don't use perspective.&lt;br&gt;
Use prespective property like this. For example, our HTML structure is like&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"parent"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"element"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we give CSS like this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1000px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rotateX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;10deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xAKpCJ3L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bbiunjvhcwnfg3gmfyuu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xAKpCJ3L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bbiunjvhcwnfg3gmfyuu.png" alt="Translate (3)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should give perspective property to the parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#skew"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Skew
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skew value is used to define 2D skew transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;skewX(deg) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to skew element in X axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;skewY(deg) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is used to skew element in Y axis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;skew(deg) &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it is a short form for skewX and skewY&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TI0yRKJn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hiycml2q7h7e1ickxzsp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TI0yRKJn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hiycml2q7h7e1ickxzsp.png" alt="Translate (4)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's sit about CSS transform values. I hope you understood each and everything. If you have doubt or I missed some point let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/jahongir2007/creating-simple-telegram-bot-in-node-js-and-telegraf-js-step-by-step-30pn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will learn how to create a simple bot in Node.js and Telegraf.js. It's very easy. Let’s first learn what Node.js is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Node.js?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js is a runtime application. It allows you to use the JS programming language outside the browser. With Node.js you can work with data analysis or write a telegram bot and create HTTP servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-telegrafjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Telegraf.js?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telegraf.js is a framework for Node.js that allows you to create awesome bots in Node.js runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-download-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Download Node.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2JugyWn9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1kp3otek1mfva304z74.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2JugyWn9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1kp3otek1mfva304z74.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After downloading Node.js, let's check its version.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZQpgeqMX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ntz72zbhps5sti4slxg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZQpgeqMX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ntz72zbhps5sti4slxg.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-creating-file-for-our-simple-telegram-bot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Creating file for our simple telegram bot
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir bot-app
cd bot-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5pURBin2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qq9mffkf4l6nyvc0zszo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5pURBin2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qq9mffkf4l6nyvc0zszo.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-with-the-help-of-botfather-we-will-create-our-new-bot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: With the help of Botfather we will create our new bot
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we create a bot in Botfather, it provides us with a bot token. The bot token, on the other hand, helps us write logic to it in node.js. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zt764tCw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1lec5d01iw5l1oh9ukbo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zt764tCw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1lec5d01iw5l1oh9ukbo.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-we-download-telegrafjs-via-npm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: We download Telegraf.js via NPM.
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install telegraf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We start creating the bot by downloading Telegraf.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-creating-bot-in-nodejs-and-telegrafjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5: Creating bot in Node.js and Telegraf.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first create a file called &lt;code&gt;bot.js&lt;/code&gt;. Importing Telegraf in &lt;code&gt;bot.js&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// bot.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telegraf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;telegraf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// importing telegraf.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we declare a variable named bot and add to it the token of the bot we created in botfather.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// bot.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telegraf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1928550358:AAH9Y4Bscfu2-y_OptOkzi3VyhbLaV84a8Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We saved our bot token to the bot variable &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We write down what our bot will do when it receives the start command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// bot.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
   Hi, I'm a simple bot
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's check it out now:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bsMjqYNJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gljw6l8jxwh5kk0lg5ui.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bsMjqYNJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gljw6l8jxwh5kk0lg5ui.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’ll add some options to our boat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// bot.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
   Hi, I'm a simple bot (please write /help)
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter what the bot will do when the word /help is typed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// bot.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
   Hello, world!!!
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All codes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telegraf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;telegraf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// importing telegraf.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Telegraf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1928550358:AAH9Y4Bscfu2-y_OptOkzi3VyhbLaV84a8Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We saved our bot token to the bot variable &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
Hi, I'm a simple bot (please write /help)
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
   Hello world!
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9AZavroh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/roitxhwjvh3rk3fz7fx1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9AZavroh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/roitxhwjvh3rk3fz7fx1.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day in shoes of father developer</title>
      <author>Pavel Polívka</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:58:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/day-in-shoes-of-father-developer-11k8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pavel_polivka/day-in-shoes-of-father-developer-11k8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I want to go over my daily routine and describe my work process. It's important to have some kind of routine each day. I do not stick to it 100% as developers we are supposed to be agile and as such we sometimes need to change our plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daily routine is changing with time and my priorities. So do not take this as the best plan you can do. Take it as an inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#priorities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Priorities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my daughter was born my priorities changed a lot. I realized that I do not want to spend all her childhood at work. I used to go to the office every day, the commute took me 2 hours per day. Spend 8 hours there working. One-hour lunch. I did not see her for more than a few minutes per day. Add some open source work and side-project work in the evenings and I did not see my girlfriend that much more. So my biggest priority became to &lt;strong&gt;be more with my family&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is still very important to me though. I really enjoy what I do and you know it brings money to our family. To be successful in my work I cannot effort to just sit through 8 hours of work every day, I need to learn new stuff, improve my skills, etc... So another priority is &lt;strong&gt;my work&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last priority on this list is &lt;strong&gt;myself&lt;/strong&gt;. When I started with this priority shift I kinda did not realize that myself should be my priority as well. I was not feeling very happy. I was tired all the time. And to be honest I missed some of my me time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I realized my priority shift I realize I need to do something with my life and routine. The first thing I did was I changed jobs. I realized that if I want to spend more time with my family I need to work from home. My current job offered one day per week, which was not enough and I kinda wanted to change that job anyway. Now I work mostly out of the home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we did, we moved out of the city to a village bit outside Prague. Not we have nice 4 bedroom house and I have my own office in there. I still get to leave and go to the office so that I have a routine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#morning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Morning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning we (as a family) woke up at around 7 AM. This is mostly driven by the hour daughter that simply wakes up at that hour. I do not have an alarm set up. Days, when she wakes up a little bit later, are a nice surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing in the morning we do our personal hygiene and have a nice family breakfast together. Then I spend some playtime with my daughter and around 8:30 I go to the office to start the workday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note here when I spend time with my family I try for it to be at least one hour of uninterrupted time. Less seems like cheating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#work-day"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Work Day
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing in the morning I will compile a TODO list. I start by copying the tasks that were not finished yesterday I will add new ones from email, calendar, etc... I prioritize those by the ABCDE method and start the work on the A task. During the day I am adding tasks to my list. If those are not finished I will prioritize them the next day. If anything urgent comes up I deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to do my work with the Pomodoro technique. I use &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef"&gt;Marinara Chrome Extension&lt;/a&gt;. I do 20 minutes focus intervals and 5 minute breaks between those. I usually try to do at least 8 focus intervals per day. During these, I do my best working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During breaks, I recently started to do Twitter. I want to build some online following so during a break I will take time to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of my 8 hours is spent doing meetings, emails, ad-hock work, or low-priority tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently for some meetings, I started to go for walks during those. I just take headphones, phone and go to the on the walk meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a week I am trying to write a blog article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lunch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lunch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch is another important part of my day for me. It's another meal we are having together as a family. After lunch, my daughter goes to sleep and I either spent that time going back to work (so that I can stop early that day) or spent it doing errands. Like grocery shopping, etc... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evening"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evening
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I try to end my work as soon as possible. I can always work for few hours in the evening, I cannot spend that time with my daughter tho as she is already asleep. I try to spend at least two to three hours here every evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she is sleeping there are some options I try to balance into my week. I either exercise, spend time gardening, doing side projects, or doing some other hobby (I love Warhammer 40k miniature painting). Then I spent some time with my girlfriend either watching TV, playing board games, etc... Some evenings we spend apart reading or doing our own things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekends
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the weekends I try not to work at all. My goal is not even to start the computer. We are trying to go on trips, spend days at the pool, etc... &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#installation-free-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation (Free Version):
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1install-with-npm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1)Install with NPM:
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i @hypertheme-editor/chakra-ui
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or if you use Yarn:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add @hypertheme-editor/chakra-ui

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2configure-themeeditorprovider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2)Configure ThemeEditorProvider
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ThemeEditorProvider /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component just below your &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ChakraProvider /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, like in this example for NextJS:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as React from 'react'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import theme from '../my-theme'
import { ThemeEditorProvider } from "@hypertheme-editor/chakra-ui"

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    &amp;lt;ChakraProvider theme={theme}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;ThemeEditorProvider&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Component {...pageProps} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/ThemeEditorProvider&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ChakraProvider&amp;gt;
  )
}

export default App
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3add-the-themeeditordrawerbutton"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3)Add the ThemeEditorDrawerButton
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ThemeEditorDrawerButton /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where you need it, the component provides ChakraUI ButtonProps, so you can place it where you prefer and change the button behaviour:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as React from 'react'
import { Box } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { ThemeEditorDrawerButton } from '@hypertheme-editor/chakra-ui'

function Layout() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
      ...rest of layout
      &amp;lt;ThemeEditorDrawerButton pos="fixed" bottom={4} right={2} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
  )
}

export default Layout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enjoy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enjoy
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a theme editor for your ChakraUI projects. Click the Export button to obtain a droppable theme in js or ts format in a ZIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-pro-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation (Pro Version):
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-obtain-a-license-key"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Obtain a license key
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypertheme Editor PRO is hosted on a private NPM registry accessible with a license.&lt;br&gt;
Don't have a license key? (Get PRO license)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://hyperting.gumroad.com/l/hypertheme-editor"&gt;Get you license&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-configure-your-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Configure your project
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a .npmrc file in the root folder of your project with the below content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@hypertheme-editor-pro:registry=https://npm.hyperthe.me
registry=https://registry.npmjs.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-login-to-hypertheme-editor-pro-npm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Login to Hypertheme Editor PRO NPM
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To login in the private registry you have to run npm run login, when asked use hypertheme as the Username and your license key as the Password:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm login --registry=https://npm.hyperthe.me

Username: hypertheme
Password: &amp;lt;YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&amp;gt;
Email: (this IS public) &amp;lt;YOUR_EMAIL&amp;gt;

Logged in as hypertheme on https://npm.hyperthe.me/.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-install-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Install it
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install with NPM:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i @hypertheme-editor-pro/chakra-ui
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or with yarn:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add @hypertheme-editor-pro/chakra-ui
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-set-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Set up
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation is super easy and fast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the component &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ThemeEditorProvider /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;just below the  component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the component &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ThemeEditorDrawerButton /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import * as React from "react"
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { ThemeEditorProvider, ThemeEditorDrawerButton } from '@hypertheme-editor-pro/chakra-ui'
import theme from './my-theme'

function App() {
  return (
    &amp;lt;ChakraProvider theme={theme}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;ThemeEditorProvider&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ThemeEditorDrawerButton pos="fixed" bottom={4} right={2} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/ThemeEditorProvider&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ChakraProvider&amp;gt;
  )
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6enjoy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6.Enjoy
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have an inline editor in your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#credits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Credits
&lt;/h4&gt;

      <title>Create &amp; share your CV for anyone to review it online</title>
      <author>Rotimi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rotimi_je_suis/create-share-your-cv-for-anyone-to-review-it-online-1e1a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many job seekers apply to 80-100 jobs per day or per week. Most job seekers never get feedback or replies as to what went wrong their CVs and application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My platform provides an online intuitive system where job seekers are able to create and share links to their CVs with anyone for a quick review per section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--unzQ4XeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wxnhomaemrlqxf4bixua.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--unzQ4XeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wxnhomaemrlqxf4bixua.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the CV review equivalent of reddit's "roast my startup".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video introduction showing how the online CV review feature works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video link is &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rHgxRF2iVSE"&gt;https://youtu.be/rHgxRF2iVSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My platform is relatively new. Hence I am giving free premium coupon codes to the next 50 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register here &lt;a href="https://kwickbox.cloud"&gt;https://kwickbox.cloud&lt;/a&gt; and then I'll be sending your free premium coupon code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unable to create webpack bundle for chrome extension</title>
      <author>Sajal Arora</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 08:16:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sajal_arora_bf838c9eb6a01/unable-to-create-webpack-bundle-for-chrome-extension-4a4e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sajal_arora_bf838c9eb6a01/unable-to-create-webpack-bundle-for-chrome-extension-4a4e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am fairly new to chrome extension development. I am trying to use webpack for bundling since I am using node modules. The entry file in my case is &lt;code&gt;service-worker.js&lt;/code&gt; since that's where the modules and packages are being imported. I end up with the following error on build.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReferenceError: window is not defined
    at shouldUseActiveX (service-worker.js:870)
    at createHTMLParser (service-worker.js:843)
    at Object../node_modules/turndown/lib/turndown.browser.es.js (service-worker.js:877)
    at __webpack_require__ (service-worker.js:1594)
    at Object../src/service/save-url-section.js (service-worker.js:1372)
    at __webpack_require__ (service-worker.js:1594)
    at service-worker.js:1658
    at service-worker.js:1887
    at service-worker.js:1890
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that this question had been asked several times before for different scenarios. The &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object in background is not allowed. But in my situation I have&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;       &lt;span class="nx"&gt;chrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scripting&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;executeScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;tabId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tabId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./foreground/saveUrl.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in my &lt;code&gt;service-worker.js&lt;/code&gt;. Now I am assuming that the path mentioned in the &lt;code&gt;files&lt;/code&gt; array is getting resolved and bringing all the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; into the bundled file which is why I am ending up the above error. I really need help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW this is my webpack config&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NODE_ENV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// popup: path.join(__dirname, "src", "popup", "popup.js"),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;service-worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;service-worker.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;globalObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__dirname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;[name].js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;css$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;style-loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;css-loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;exclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/node_modules/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;RegExp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileExtensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
