      <title>Is there a way to convert dynamically allocated memory to static memory OR copy ptr contents in C/C++?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, static memory is memory that is memory that is assigned, managed, and freed for you (an example is &lt;code&gt;char const* str = "Hello World!";&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
C/C++ will clean that string up for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dynamically allocated memory is memory you request, manage, and must clean yourself (an example is &lt;code&gt;Type_t* array = malloc( sizeof(Type_t)*arrLength );&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm messing around with C strings in C++, even testing ideas for my own &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type. - And I was creating a &lt;code&gt;String +(char c)&lt;/code&gt; method, when I thought of something: "How can I return a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; object whose &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; property is statically allocated, and not dynamically allocated?".&lt;br&gt;
Since the only method of adding a character to an immutable string I can think of involves using &lt;code&gt;malloc( (oldStrLen+1)*sizeof(char) )&lt;/code&gt;, which is dynamically allocated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, is there a way I can copy the contents of a pointer to a &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; statically allocated pointer, or convert dynamically allocated memory to statically allocated memory in C/C++?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks!&lt;br&gt;Cheers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <title>Electron Adventures: Episode 99: Should You Use Electron?</title>
      <author>Tomasz Wegrzanowski</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:40:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/taw/electron-adventures-episode-99-should-you-use-electron-4cek</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/taw/electron-adventures-episode-99-should-you-use-electron-4cek</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So now that my 100-episode Electron Adventure series is coming to a close, I want to spend the final two episodes on a retrospective. This episode will be about Electron, and the next one about the series itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#idea-behind-electron"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Idea behind Electron
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform GUI development has always been a huge pain. Your choices were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write the app multiple times, once for each platform, in multiple different low-level languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use some "cross-platform" lowest common denominator solution like various Java toolkits that results in an awful experience for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just drop the whole idea and make the app single platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, web development was ridiculously easy, and ridiculously powerful, and it was all cross-platform by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the whole idea behind Electron was basically "screw all that, we'll just ship a whole browser with the app". And it worked. So well that today you'd be very hard pressed to name any decent cross-platform GUI apps that aren't Electron apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-electron-controversial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is Electron controversial?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever anyone mentions Electron, it instantly triggers haters who absolutely cannot stand the idea of bundling the whole browser. The haters are especially bitter because they are losing utterly, and they cannot even begin to offer any alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first objection is that it takes too much space. This was always a stupid argument, and it got even worse as time goes. Even the shitty entry level laptops have 256GB+ disks these days, so if you download 100 Electron apps at 100MB each - not something a typical user does - even that's less than 4% of your laptop's disk. And this becomes less and less relevant as time goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really this isn't Electron specific issue. The whole software world moved hard to "bundle all the things" mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days where an app would just use whatever happened to be installed on a local machine are gone. Every app comes with a &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; or its equivalent specifying exact versions of every single dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that goes even further. Instead of just bundling some JavaScript libraries with &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, or some browser with Electron, more and more apps just bundle a whole Linux distribution with Docker, and run that. Or they bundle a whole collection of Dockers for different parts of the app, with multiple Linux distributions inside. Some recent languages like Go basically decided to not even support traditional shared libraries - if you use some code, you have to bundle it into a single executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electron deciding to bundle the browser back in 2013 was ahead of its times, but now this is hardly a controversial decision. Everyone bundles everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-based-alternatives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web based alternatives
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the series, we tried a huge number of alternatives to Electron, and found all of them to be pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's two kinds of alternatives to Electron. The first is all the other web-based solutions that just don't bundle the browser, and use whatever's installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle this works, as long as the user has a recent version of Chrome or such, like with Ferrum. But they need to be strict about it, and if no Chrome (or Chromium) is found, they need to just tell the user to install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even that doesn't quite solve the problem. Electron bundles two things - browser and node. Even if we use user's browser, we still need to bundle the backend language, and none of the languages have easy cross-platform bundling story. OSX comes with really old versions of Ruby and Python, Windows comes with .NET, Linux comes with whatever each distro decides (at least some sort of Python), none of them were made with portability in mind. It would be great if we could just ship an app in a Docker to the user, just like we can with servers, but we're not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, every alternative we've tried that used OS-bundled HTML view, like Safari, os whatever Qt has, and so on - all of them have been a total disaster. The web is easy to develop for, as it's basically all Chrome, or things that try to keep up with Chrome. Not having to deal with IE11 or obsolete Safari or some half-working toolkit-specific browsers is definitely worth paying for with a 100MB download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#non-web-alternatives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Non web alternatives
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing we tried were a bunch of non-web-based alternatives. I tried to pick the most promising ones, and skip the obvious trash, but none of them were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's no surprise really. Every Java-based GUI I've seen was a barely functioning disaster, and Qt-based GUIs were not much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention none of them really solve our problems. OK, so we don't bundle the browser, but is telling user to "install Java" or "install Qt" actually better than telling them to "install Chrome"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I said before, we'd still need to somehow install the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-choices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best choices
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think anything can really compete with Electron when it comes to cross-platform desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best Web based alternative would be either "just run in the user's browser" (Jupyter style) any of the "ask the user to install Chrome" solutions (Ferrum style). I think these could be turned into viable solutions with modest effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging only by the quality of GUI programs I've used, I suspect the best of the non-Web alternatives would be .NET. It comes preinstalled with Windows, which is otherwise the most painful system to target, and it can sort of work on other systems. As I was writing the series on a Mac, I never tried that, but I've seen others be somewhat successful with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qt based solutions were mediocre at best, and Java based solutions were all an unmitigated disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-electron"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use Electron
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I recommend Electron so strongly, what do I recommend using with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the language, vanilla JavaScript. We've long been promised ability to use any language for web development, but so far none of such promises have been delivered. Flavored JavaScript (CoffeeScript, TypeScript, etc.) don't really offer anything meaningful for their cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the framework, you can't go wrong with Svelte, which is the leading 3rd generation framework. There's nothing too wrong with using React, which was the leading 2nd generation framework, but React is extremely limited by being based on web capabilities and thinking from the mid IE era, and has a big advantage that you're more likely to know it, but looking forward, Svelte is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think other frameworks really have much to offer that those two don't. I really wanted to try Imba 2 with the series, but Imba 2's tooling was really getting in the way of Electron, and I was able to fix some of these issues but not all, so I ended up dropping the idea (I definitely ought to PR those fixes). Maybe Imba will be the next Svelte, but it's not there now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Electron, due to its origin in attaching browser frontend to node backend with some IPC duct tape, many of its architectural choices are really awkward, with many concerns being on the wrong side of the frontend/backend divide, or even worse split between both. Fortunately, there's a lively ecosystem of npm packages that deal with a lot of that awkwardness around things like managing window positions, saving user settings, and so on, and you should absolutely check if there's a package that solves your problem instead of forcing yourself to use plain Electron alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#coming-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coming next
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that concludes everything I wanted to say about Electron. In the final 100th episode of the series, I'll look back at what it was like to write a 100-episode daily blog post series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week III Task Force 4.0</title>
      <author>Placideh</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:24:01 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/placideh/week-iii-task-force-40-o94</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Can't Lie 🤣 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello again, now I could say that I am already a Task Force🦾 , this week was cool and super I have experienced working as a team and the merits from it. Basically this is the week that the team(Task-Force) really become one element, by this we started working together brainstorming to come up with a great &lt;strong&gt;MVP&lt;/strong&gt;(Minimum Viable Product), I have also liked the way we started sharing our own personal life experience which was also a great takeaway like Empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have loved the Soft skills that I have been introduced to, ain't going to lie it was really a valuable sessions. As Backend Developers we also have to work and collaborate on Technical skills that's where the team working , cooperation and creativity comes to play, This week we have worked on &lt;strong&gt;ERD&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Entity relationship diagram&lt;/em&gt; mainly we've designed possible Entities to be used in our project not only that we have  created their cardinalities as well as creating their &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; queries . throughout SQL I have come to see a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;json&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; datatype in MySql🤔 That's made me  realize that This Field is all about learning journey, The more you learn the more you tend to find you know less but, in anyways it is great and super.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to see you the next Week !!! ✌.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TypeScript ANY vs UNKNOWN—A Deep Dive</title>
      <author>Tom Dohnal</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 21:23:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tomdohnal/typescript-any-vs-unknown-a-deep-dive-3iem</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tomdohnal/typescript-any-vs-unknown-a-deep-dive-3iem</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we'll dive deep into what &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; types are, what are their similarities and differences, and when (not) to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can find a video version of this article on YouTube! 📺)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6UUEeq0oSg"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR;
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ANY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;whatever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript (error in runtime!) 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 


&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// UNKNOWN&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;whatever, too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Fails TypeScript check (prevents runtime error) 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mnemonics to help you remember the difference 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; first letter is an "A" -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Avoid&lt;/em&gt; TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; first letter is a "U" -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Use&lt;/em&gt; TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chapter-1"&gt;The &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; Type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chapter-2"&gt;The &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; Type&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chapter-3"&gt;Use Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-any-endraw-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; Type
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type is something like an escape hatch from TypeScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your variable is of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, you can:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. Assign whatever you want to it 👇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hi, how is you? :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;password?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. "Do" whatever you want with it 👇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript but error in runtime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ("...is not a function")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript but error in runtime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ("...Cannot read properties of undefined")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, using &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; allows you to use variables &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; type checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOHRx9PB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sndm73objhbmpssml6gx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uOHRx9PB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sndm73objhbmpssml6gx.jpg" alt='soldier being shot by an arrow saying "any"' width="636" height="767"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;a href="https://devrant.com/rants/3015646/i-dont-usually-post-memes-but-this-one-is-just-a-little-too-on-the-nose"&gt;https://devrant.com/rants/3015646/i-dont-usually-post-memes-but-this-one-is-just-a-little-too-on-the-nose&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you lose the main benefit TypeScript has to offer–preventing runtime errors due to accessing non-existing properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might now wonder &lt;strong&gt;why the heck would I even use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; if it means giving up type checking altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, you should strive to avoid it. To do that, I'd advise you to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1) Use &lt;code&gt;"strict": true&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file to disable &lt;em&gt;implicit&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implicit any&lt;/em&gt; means that if you don't annotate a variable or a function parameter in TypeScript, it'll be &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; by default. With &lt;code&gt;"strict": true&lt;/code&gt;, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error if you've got an unannotated variable of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-explicit-any.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;no-explicit-any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rule in &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint"&gt;TypeScript ESLint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This will give you an ESLint warning whenever you use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are some situations where &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; is helpful. We'll cover the main use cases in &lt;a href="#chapter-3"&gt;the final section&lt;/a&gt; in depth. Nonetheless, it can be useful when migrating JavaScript code to TypeScript or when dealing with untyped external libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Careful! Some built-in TypeScript types use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When using functions like &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse(...)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fetch(...).then(res =&amp;gt; res.json())&lt;/code&gt;, the type of the result is &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use something like &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse(...) as { message: string }&lt;/code&gt; to give it a proper type. Nonetheless, it's useful to know about these as it's very easy to accidentally use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; without even knowing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use rules such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-unsafe-assignment.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;no-unsafe-assingment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint"&gt;TypeScript ESLint&lt;/a&gt; to get warnings in such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does TypeScript behave in this &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; type-safe manner? Well, one of the possible explanations is that there was no other way to type these built-in JavaScript functions as there was no &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type that would be better suited for this job. Let's have a look at what it does and how it differs from the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-unknown-endraw-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; Type
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type was added to TypeScript in 2018 with its version &lt;code&gt;3.0&lt;/code&gt; release. Its purpose was to provide a type-safe alternative to &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs:&lt;br&gt;
TypeScript 3.0 introduces a new top type &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; is the type-safe counterpart of &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type"&gt;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#new-unknown-top-type&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the phrase "type-safe counterpart of &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;" suggests, the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type is similar to the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type in some way but different in others (namely, unlike &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, it's type-safe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first examine the similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; assign whatever you want to an &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This works pretty much the same way as the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; type 👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hey, how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;re you doing? :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;signUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;email?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With variables of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; you could do anything with such variables (call them, access random properties on them, etc.). This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case with &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;, TypeScript &lt;strong&gt;makes &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; assumptions about your variables&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error in TypeScript 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error in TypeScript 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Error in TypeScript 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is very helpful as it prevents you from accidentally accessing non-existent properties, treating strings like functions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type as of something like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the actual definition of the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type. It's just a simplified model to give you a better intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-narrowing-with-raw-unknown-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type narrowing with &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the code snippet above, TypeScript doesn't allow you to do almost anything with the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it's very useful as it keeps your code type-safe and prevents you from the dreaded runtime JavaScript TypeErrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it's quite limiting as we'd like to be able to manipulate our variables, call properties on them, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got 2 options for how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Type Guards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can use type guards to narrow down the possible types. You can use &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements or custom &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates"&gt;type predicates&lt;/a&gt; to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logSecretMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// in this if-block we know `message` is of type string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// so we can call the `toLowerCase()` method on it&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Type Assertions (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; type-safe)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, we can always use type assertions. This is way easier but we lose the type-safety as we use whatever type we want and TypeScript will just "trust" us that we made no mistake:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// OK in TypeScript but it *fails* in runtime 👇&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknownVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toFixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-cases-for-raw-any-endraw-and-raw-unknown-endraw-types"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Cases for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; Types
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got understanding of what the &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; types mean, let's have a look at when (not) to use each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb is that &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; should be avoided since using it makes you lose most of the TypeScript benefits. If you don't know what type a certain variable or a function parameter is, always prefer &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, there are some valid use cases for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#migrating-to-typescript-from-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Migrating to TypeScript (from JavaScript)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; is very useful when migrating JavaScript codebase into TypeScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you've got a large JavaScript file which exports many functions and you want to convert it to TypeScript. Without using &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;, you'd need to type every single function in this file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of work and you might just be interested in typing one of the exported functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can use &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; to quickly type the functions you're not interested in and only give proper types to the one function you're currently working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be also useful to create an alias for &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; (such as &lt;code&gt;type TODO = any&lt;/code&gt;) so that you can later come back to your temporarily typed functions and give them proper types.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// auth.ts (migrating from auth.js)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We can just type the `signUp` function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;signUp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use `TODO` to quickly type the `resetPassword` function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resetPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use `TODO` to quickly type the `logIn` function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functions-with-unknown-arguments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functions with unknown arguments
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously stated, the &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; type should be preferred when dealing with variables which types we can't determine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example could be a generic logger function 👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendMessageToAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Had we used &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; instead, we could have accidentally tried to use properties such as &lt;code&gt;.toLowerCase()&lt;/code&gt; (wrongly) assuming that &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, using &lt;code&gt;unknown&lt;/code&gt; instead keeps things safe for us 😇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our New Revolutionary Enterprise Product -  &lt;a href="https://www.eimsolutions.com"&gt;SCH ( Supply Chain Hub )&lt;/a&gt; , from EIM Solutions, SCHinfoTech.com, is helping Companies streamline their business processes. It helps companies digitize the connections, interactions &amp;amp; end to end business process integration with :-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suppliers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt; ( Factory )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It connects an organization's ERP systems, digital landscape and digital processes to the &lt;strong&gt;LAST MILE&lt;/strong&gt;. SCH ( supply chain hub ) has 4 modules, that addresses the above 4 business functions, namely :-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCH Supplier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCH Customer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCH Factory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCH Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers can subscribe to 1 or more of the above modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9kz-Z8AS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1636916968316/lkCZmm-H5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9kz-Z8AS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1636916968316/lkCZmm-H5.png" alt="SCHLogo_Blue.png" width="880" height="204"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCH is a cloud based PWA Web Application that can run on its own, or integrate with Backend Systems like SAP ERP or any others systems, depending on customer preference. It can run on any cloud platform, even on-premise in customer's data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can run on any browser, any device, of any screen size ( mobile / tablet/ laptop/ desktop ). It can also be installed as a Native App on Windows or Mobile, from Browser, Google PlayStore or IOS AppStore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a very attractive, user friendly and interesting UI Experience, which is very intuitive and easy to operate for any Non IT business user. Its screens are mobile responsive and behaves like any other Native App when it runs on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company can subscribe to multiple SCH modules. After a user logs in, he/she can see those modules, which he/she has access to, as clickable UI cards as shown in the above image. He/ She can click one of those modules, to get inside it, and start executing it's business processes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCH is being used by multiple companies, across the globe, like Coca Cola , Aditya Birla, Toyota Boshuku, L&amp;amp;T IDPL, Cavinkare, Mahindra CIE, Jindal Steel Works, Olam etc. They use SCH to connect with their suppliers, customers, factory and maintenance, and make their business processes efficient, profitable, contact less, paper less, and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many more customers are currently getting onboarded, as I am writing this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zE66eD2t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1636914464234/vPvO1JPvj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zE66eD2t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1636914464234/vPvO1JPvj.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-11-14 23.43.45.png" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host a static website on AWS under a minute with Terraform</title>
      <author>Emre Oztoprak</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 20:23:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/host-a-static-website-on-aws-under-a-minute-with-terraform-3hmd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/host-a-static-website-on-aws-under-a-minute-with-terraform-3hmd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a static website and you want a simple solution, S3 and Cloudfront are great choices. S3 with Cloudfront secure, scalable way to host static content. Also, we will get an SSL certificate for our domain and it will be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the deployment of this terraform module, make sure your hosted zone exists in Route 53 and move your domain to Route53 by changing NS records on your DNS provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icnRWvWe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7tophd1lmax66q2podj4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--icnRWvWe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7tophd1lmax66q2podj4.jpg" alt="terraform-s3-cloudfront-route53" width="750" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use 4 AWS Services;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;S3 - Storing website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudfront - CDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certificate Manager - SSL Certificate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Route 53 - DNS records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are using Cloudfront we don't need the public bucket, so we will create a private S3 bucket. We will use OAI (Origin Access Identity) settings when we create Cloudfront. This means that only our Cloudfront distribution can access and read the files in our S3 bucket. Also, we will create an SSL certificate from Certificate Manager and Cloudfront redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X9mtn7kV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8gxdt39ga82ch41dafw6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X9mtn7kV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8gxdt39ga82ch41dafw6.png" alt="cloudfront-oai" width="555" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First clone the repository&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:emreoztoprak/terraform-aws-s3-cloudfront-acm.git

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Change these two variables in the &lt;strong&gt;terraform.tfvars&lt;/strong&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
SiteTags = "Example" (Tag value of the resources.)

domainName = "example.com"

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can now run this module when you change the variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform init
terraform plan
terrafom apply --auto-approve

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the deployment is completed upload your website files to in S3 Bucket. I configured DefaultRootObject as index.html. Basically, when users access your root URL they will see index.html file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just uploaded a simple HTML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations. You made it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aE1WUO-6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zvx04yfdub78ls5g9z0e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aE1WUO-6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zvx04yfdub78ls5g9z0e.png" alt="aws-cloudfront" width="880" height="558"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you find this tutorial helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's talk quality - Part 1</title>
      <author>Sociable Steve</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 20:17:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sociablesteve/lets-talk-quality-part-1-4ecm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sociablesteve/lets-talk-quality-part-1-4ecm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quality of engineered software systems is something which is commonly overlooked by non-technical decision makers in many companies, of every size. There are two main reasons behind this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers don't know how to discuss the problem with non-technical stake-holders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lack of data about how quality issues affect engineering efforts in a way that non-technical decision makers can understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first part of a series about how we can understand and talk about quality in a way that our non-technical colleagues can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-current-landscape"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The current landscape
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since software quality is inherently something seen and driven by engineers, the current approach to quality is to look at the problem in terms of what can be measured and understood automatically, and reported on quickly. The reports and information that are produced are technically focused, and offer little in the way of understandable reporting for the non-technical stake-holders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like SonarQube, Snyk, CodeClimate, and other static analysis tools do a great job at letting software engineers know where problems exist. Tools like prometheus, NewRelic, and the ELK stack help operations understand the current issues in a running stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#beyond-code-quality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Beyond code quality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, and even years, I've been contemplating the scope and size of quality for engineered software systems. The first step is some kind of definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high quality software system is one that is easily maintainable, scale-able, extendable, and meets the needs of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a single sentence, this definition covers a wide range of activities, and we still need some way to further define how we measure and report on quality. This leads me to three broad categories of measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Development measure covers metrics related to the development process of the software system. This isn't just the code, but the quality of activities around the code as well, such as code reviews, QA activities, and developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclomatic Complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Duplication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PR Review Quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production Bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-production Bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer Experience

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to get started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overly monolithic / Hard to navigate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#operational"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Operational
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Operational measure covers metrics related to how the software runs in whatever environment is ends up in. This covers things like resource usage, scalability, observability, and issue recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource usage

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging frequency

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall log lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log lines per request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log relevance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observability

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to understand where an issue is occurring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to understand usage patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy can the system be scaled?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alerting

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to know when there is an issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sentiment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sentiment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can measure how the operational and development teams are doing, there is also a reality that software systems are developed to fix a problems. Understanding the sentiment of the systems consumers (users, customers, etc.) is also a great indicator of the overall quality of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some example measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the system meet the needs of the user?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the system easy to use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the system performance sufficient?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you worry when the system is included in product development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By considering quality as something more than just how well the code is written we can start to get a better understanding of quality from many different angles, and start to understand where we need to focus our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post I'll cover how we can start measuring these metrics, before going onto reporting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how many people have join the ranks of coders over the last few years. Whether you are a professional coder or just code for fun, learning this skill will definitely change your outlook on life and how you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of online tutorials, bootcamps, YouTube videos and blogs, learning the basics of coding is extremely easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some of these resources are limited in what they offer. Sure, you can learn theory, algorithms, data structures, etc. But if new developers would like to improve certain skills, for example, how to structure a large application, how to create performant and secure code, how to create test cases, log and fix bugs, documentation, communication with other team members, etc they need to get their hands wet. One of the best ways to do this is to join an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many new developers though, joining an open source project seems daunting. They may feel they do not have the skills to contribute, and such fears are understandable. I could spend the rest of this article explaining why they shouldn't let fear stop them from joining an open source project, but instead I will offer another solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#another-free-alternative"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Another Free Alternative
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many articles talk about how to use GitHub, Gutbucket, Gitlab, or a similar open source repository to upload your code. Many of these articles fail to help new developers to see the rich and vast amount of information these free repositories have to offer to new developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use GitHub as an example. You can create a free account using your email address. You can search, download, read through and play with code that experienced developers have created and uploaded for other people to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-the-benefits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are the benefits?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these repositories are real, live code that thousands of people use everyday. You will learn valuable lessons on how to structure code, how to use code to tackle a problem, proper documentation, proper testing, logging and resolving bugs, how to commit code with proper commit messages, how to structure branches and releases, how to use CI/CD (if the repo is using it), how to write performant code, how to write secure code, etc.&lt;br&gt;
You can learn so much from these projects. You can learn at your own pace. And this is a free method to improve your coding skills.&lt;br&gt;
The main point is you do not need to join an open source project to improve your coding skills. You are welcome to download the code, read it, run it, play with it, and learn from it.&lt;br&gt;
Build your skills. Build your knowledge. Build your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-do%C2%A0it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to do it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most popular projects will have a Readme file, an example folder, a test folder and a src folder. "src" is short for source, and this is where the bulk of the code can be found.&lt;br&gt;
First, read the Readme file to understand the purpose of the project and how to set up everything. Next, take a look at the example folder. Usually the examples are simple so it will be easy to understand the code. Play around with the examples. This will also help you later when you are looking in the src folder. Finally, take a look at the tests. Run them and see if you understand what's happening. See if you can write your own test case following their format. Obviously, a big project will have comprehensive test cases. But still this is good training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as reading books can open your mind to the world around you. Reading open source code will open your mind to the world of software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
