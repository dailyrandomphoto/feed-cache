&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week i was privileged to be among the amazing speakers at &lt;strong&gt;Cisco DevNet Create 2021 Conference&lt;/strong&gt; to speak on how we can use deep learning techniques to detect network attacks, in this article i am going to convert my session slides into a technical article, i hope you enjoys reading the article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZHaZ1bAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a13w1mdjv9oyauptwz23.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZHaZ1bAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a13w1mdjv9oyauptwz23.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the continuous development of computer network technology, security problems in the network are emerging one after another, and hence new threats and challenges have emerged to wireless communication system, especially in cybersecurity and it is becoming more and more difficult to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the current network administrators, how to successfully prevent malicious network hackers from invading, so that network systems and computers are at Safe and normal operation is an urgent task.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent vast amount of data being produced everyday, we have access to extensible dataset to learn from and tackle sophisticated attackers who can easily bypass basic intrusion detection systems (IDS). This is where deep learning comes into play. During this presentation we will discover how we can use deep learning to detect network attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first let understand network attacks and deep learning as different domain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-deep-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What is Deep Learning&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to human, learning by examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognise important traffic signs. It is the key to voice control consumers devices like tablets laptops and mobile phone, and currently it is becoming the key technology in network attack detection, using deep learning we can detect an irregular patterns that may be cause my malicious software in the users devices, let say laptop and be able to detect, clean or recover system from the malicious  software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine of a case where the attacker is using brute force attack, where they are trying to submit many passphrases with hopes of eventually guessing the password correctly, we can analyses the closeness of the correct password and the passphrases being submitted and enhance more security measures like asking for secrete name that the user submitted while creating let say the user account to identify  if the person or the system (eg bot) trying to login is really the legitimate owner of the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-network-attack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What is Network Attack&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network attacks as defined by forcepoint are unauthorised actions on the digital assets within an organisation network, here malicious parties usually executes network attacks to alter destroy or steal data, where the perpetrators in network attacks tends to target network perimeters to gain access to internal systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two network attacks are the passive network attack where the malicious  party gains unauthorised access to network monitors and steals private data with out making any alterations and the active network attack which involves modifying, encrypting or damaging data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the common methods which we use protecting the network includes use of antivirus, use of firewalls intrusion detecting systems, information  technology  policies, encryption, ensuring every device in a network is capable of restricting access using passwords, and detecting the attacks early using machine learning and deep learning  techniques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-deep-learning-techniques-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Why use deep learning techniques ?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays deep learning has dominated the various fields and disrupting the way we used to do many thing especially with the recent breakthrough in the artificial general intelligence, not only  do these deep learning techniques enabled rapid progress in every field they are applied, but even surpassing human performance in many of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial general Intelligence is on par with human capabilities, that is artificial general intelligence systems can perform any task that human can with greater efficacy than human can in several  activities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these tasks is image classification and pattern recognition.&lt;br&gt;
Unlike more traditional methods of machine learning techniques, deep learning classifiers are trained through feature learning rather than task-specific algorithms.&lt;br&gt;
What this means is that the machine will learn patterns in the images that it is presented with rather than requiring the human operator to define the patterns that the machine should look for in the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it can automatically extract features and classify data into various classes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-case-detecting-cloud-network-attack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Use case detecting Cloud Network Attack&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to detect cloud network attacks, you first you should start by understanding the problem, then follow the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1). Collect the cloud network dataset.&lt;br&gt;
2). Clean the data and perform feature engineer. &lt;br&gt;
3). Choose the deep learning model to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recurrent neural network, deep neural, network, grey wolf optimisation, or convolutional neural network are major choices to consider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4). Test the performance of our trained model and optimise the results &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5). Deploy the best performing model in our network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bravo we now have our network batman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember it is very important to understand the detection framework that is the approach you are using to detect the network attack, now enough of learn go practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-connect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: This post includes affiliate links; I may receive compensation if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello devs, if you are looking for best Udemy courses to learn JavaScript then you have come to the right place. I am a huge fan of Udemy and in this article I am going to share best Udemy courses for JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt; is a great platform, they make learning affordable with their frequent sales where you can get a $200 sale for just $10 but its also a big ocean, where finding the quality courses is not easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people buy courses on sale and they never complete it because they stuck with out-date and boring courses. If you join a boring course you are not going to watch more than 10 to 20 minutes and given that you have only spent $9 you will most likely to forget about it but that's a big waste of your time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, you shouldn't buy any random course on Udemy but I get it you only buy after seeing reviews and number of students, but can you trust those numbers? Well not always as many Udemy instructor promote their courses for FREE and most of the students joined using FREE coupons.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why its important to do your own research and only join Udemy courses with great instructors and great quality. Thankfully you will find them easily if you do your research but if you are in hurry then I am here to help you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have shared &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/05/top-10-udemy-courses-to-learn-python-programming.html"&gt;best Udemy courses to learn Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-udemy-online-courses-for-java-developers-4c9ab70cd01f"&gt;Java development&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/15-best-udemy-courses-programmers-can-buy-on-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-2020-a803874f41d9"&gt;Software development&lt;/a&gt; and here I am going to share best Udemy course to learn JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are truly the awesome courses and created by experts like Max from AcadMind, Jonas Schmedtmann and my favorite Brad Traversy of TraveryMedia. They are up-to-date, engaging, and comprehensive and they are worth of your time and money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-best-javascript-courses-on-udemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6 Best JavaScript Courses on Udemy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without wasting anymore of your time, here is my list of best Udemy courses to learn JavaScript. If you think a great Udemy JavaScript course is missing on this list feel free to suggest on comments and I will try to include them to make this list even better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-javascript-the-complete-guide-2021-beginner-advanced-udemy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fjavascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced%2F"&gt;JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2021 (Beginner + Advanced)&lt;/a&gt; [Udemy]
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most comprehensive and modern course you can find on JavaScript - it's based on all my JavaScript knowledge AND teaching experience. It's both a complete guide, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an extensive reference to the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers, as well as experienced JavaScript developers, get a lot out of this course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a huge course because it's packed with important knowledge and helpful content. From the core basics, over advanced concepts, and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Modern JavaScript from the beginning - all the way up to JavaScript expert is the &lt;em&gt;best Udemy course to learn javascript&lt;/em&gt; and the must-have JavaScript resource for any aspiring web developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fjavascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I5QZzcpr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1L4guCdrUwI/X5JJFC7LsCI/AAAAAAAAj7g/LEooHFGKH8sN2vz8bd6ZuciHeni9SNhKQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h225/JavaScript%252B-%252BThe%252BComplete%252BGuide%252B2020%252B%252BUdemy%252Bbest%252Bcourse.jpg" alt="best course to learn Javascript for Beginners"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-the-complete-javascript-course-2021-build-real-projects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fthe-complete-javascript-course%2F"&gt;The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: Build Real Projects!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another JavaScript course from Udemy which I held in high regard. This course is created by Jonas Schmedtmann, one of the best Udemy instructors for learning web technologies like HTML, CSS, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-5-free-courses-to-learn-web-design-in-2021-27beb817944f"&gt;Web design&lt;/a&gt;, and JavaScript and this course is his master price. In this course, you will learn JavaScript by actually developing real-world projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also one of the highest-rated Udemy JavaScript courses and full of Projects, challenges, quizzes, JavaScript ES6+, OOP, AJAX, Webpack, and everything else you need to master JavaScrkpt from scratch to depth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonas explains the core concepts in javascript in much more depth than are usually glossed over in other courses. And he does it in a manner that is clear and concise. If you can get just one JavaScript course, I recommend getting this one. If you like &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/12/top-5-project-based-courses-to-learn-java-python-javascript.html"&gt;project-based learning&lt;/a&gt; then you will love this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fthe-complete-javascript-course%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Anh9ZUq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3OPSBvlRc0U/X5JJdOwou-I/AAAAAAAAj7s/A28DEXlS1wQ-s60JB_LhUEu8J9HdYTPrACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h223/The%252BComplete%252BJavaScript%252BCourse%252B2020%252BBuild%252BReal%252BProjects%252521%252B%252Bbest%252Budemy%252Bcourse.webp" alt="best online course to learn JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-modern-javascript-from-the-beginning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmodern-javascript-from-the-beginning%2F"&gt;Modern JavaScript From The Beginning&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning JavaScript, Brad Traversy is one of the best instructors you can get. I have watched his Youtube video, particularly the JavaScript crash course, and ever since fallen in love with his teaching style. He has got a calm presence and his voice are just made for teaching and this course also shows that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite courses to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-online-courses-to-learn-javascript-in-2020-af5ed0801645"&gt;learn javascript in Udemy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and it focuses completely on JavaScript (No frameworks or libraries). You will learn by building projects which is the best way to learn JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about social proof, the course has been taken by more than 67K students and it still has on average 4.7 ratings from close to 20K participants which is phenomenal. I strongly suggest you watch the previews of this course and if you love them it will make it easy for you to commit your time to this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmodern-javascript-from-the-beginning%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f_y_jg-T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lWQVw4H1Id8/X5JKbvJPmjI/AAAAAAAAj8M/N3CWMonAgvwa2LPa6OVIpYRLitbqPpGVACLcBGAsYHQ/w387-h218/Modern%252BJavaScript%252BFrom%252BThe%252BBeginning%252Bby%252BBrad%252BTraversy.jpg" alt="best Udemy course to learn JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-the-modern-javascript-bootcamp-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=39197&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmodern-javascript%2F"&gt;The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Mead is another great instructor you can trust in learning web development concepts. Having attended his Node JS complete developer courses I had high expectations with this course and I wasn't disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D Cube with animations... Only CSS👀 feat.Naruto</title>
      <author>Krutik Raut</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 07:55:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reboot13_dev/3d-cube-with-animations-only-css-featnaruto-26a9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reboot13_dev/3d-cube-with-animations-only-css-featnaruto-26a9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/reboot13/embed/wvdWQGb?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's Get Started &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from basic CSS properties, I have used some properties which change the 2D page of the view to a 3D one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS properties:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;perspective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;perspective-origin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;transform-style&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;transform (translate/rotate)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a 3D cube we have to first make a block that contains the structure of the cube&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets White HTML first&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="scene"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class="box"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="top"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="bottom"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="left"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="right"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="back"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="front"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scene contains the body of the cube, I have given the CSS class names to the sides of the cube which I guess makes sense to you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding the Magic of CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  background-color: #ff9152;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
  perspective: 20em;
  perspective-origin: 50% calc(50% - 10em);
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have given a background color to the body, used flex to center the elements 
Use the perspective property to make the body 3D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkout docs for perspective at W3school:  &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_perspective.asp"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting &lt;em&gt;perspective-origin&lt;/em&gt; by calculating the height of the body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perspective-origin property defines at which position the user is looking at the 3D-positioned element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.scene {
  position: relative;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  animation: rotateX 7s infinite linear;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Setting the position  to relative so the elements inside it can be positioned to absolute&lt;br&gt;
respective to the scene&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a &lt;em&gt;transform-style: preserve-3d&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transform-style property specifies how nested elements are rendered in 3D space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us style the cube:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.box {
  height: 120px;
  width: 120px;
  position: relative;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  animation: rotateY 5s infinite linear;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just gave some height, position, and animation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Styling the sides of the Cube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.top,
.bottom,
.left,
.right,
.front,
.back {
  position: absolute;
  height: 120px;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  width: 120px;
  background-color: rgba(20, 116, 241, 0.281);
background-size:cover; 
box-sizing:border-box;
border: 5px solid #fff;
}
.front {
  transform: translateZ(3.7rem);
  background-image: url("https://cdn140.picsart.com/355182439052201.jpg?to=crop&amp;amp;type=webp&amp;amp;r=310x310&amp;amp;q=75");
background-size:cover;
}

.right {
  transform: rotateY(270deg) translateZ(3.7rem);
background-image: url("http://pm1.narvii.com/7533/be35ca4f98dd1790e03d932bc70c8d3588359105r1-281-281v2_uhq.jpg")

}
.back {
  transform: rotateY(180deg) translateZ(3.7rem);
background-image:url("https://cdn.costumewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sasuke-uchiha.jpg");
background-size:cover;
}
.left {
  transform: rotateY(90deg) translateZ(3.7rem);
background-image:url("https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000736438537-zvc9fi-t240x240.jpg");
background-size:cover;
}

.top {
  transform: translateY(-50%) rotateX(90deg);
scaleY(-1);
background-image:url("https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/c6/87/c2c687c78da549431b8903e0aad90184.png");
background-size:cover;
}
.bottom {
  bottom: -120px;
  transform: translateY(-50%) rotateX(90deg) scaleY(-1);
background-image: url("https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/08b81b8e-00c6-4f69-83c6-94bfc79f05c7/scale-to-width/755");
background-size:cover;

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the transform property and with use of translate and rotate will give the desired shape of the cube&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the background with characters from &lt;strong&gt;#Naruto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added Some keyframes to animate the cube&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@keyframes rotateX{
  25% {
   transform: rotateX(-180deg);
  }
  50% {
    transform: rotateY(-360deg);
 }
  70%{
   transfrom: rotateX(-180deg)
}


}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And we are done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clean Your Storage Using Appwrite's Swift Cloud Functions</title>
      <author>Damodar Lohani</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/clean-your-storage-using-appwrites-swift-cloud-functions-1h4f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9qolJzdq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u46i2voh9hi6qch63tmn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9qolJzdq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u46i2voh9hi6qch63tmn.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all those Swift developers out there, we have a good news! We have just announced our Swift SDK to work with the server-side APIs of Appwrite. You can learn more about our Swift SDK in our &lt;a href="https://dev.toswift-SDK-announcement-post"&gt;Swift SDK announcement post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial however, we are going to write, deploy and run a storage cleaner cloud function with Swift. Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-appwrite-cloud-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤔 What are Appwrite Cloud functions?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/functions"&gt;Appwrite Functions&lt;/a&gt; are a way for you to extend and customize your &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io"&gt;Appwrite BaaS&lt;/a&gt; functionality by executing your custom code. Appwrite can execute your custom code in response to any Appwrite system event like account creation, user login, or document update. You can also schedule your functions to run according to a CRON schedule or start them manually by triggering your function from an HTTP endpoint using the Appwrite client or server APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🗒️ Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to continue with this tutorial, you need to have an latest version of Appwrite console that you can access and have a project you can use to test this function. If you have not already installed Appwrite, please do so. Installing Appwrite is really simple. Based on your operating system, run one of the following commands. Installation should be done in less than 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unix"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unix
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt; /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--entrypoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"install"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    appwrite/appwrite:0.11.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#windows-cmd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Windows CMD
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight powershell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;//var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"%cd%"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--entrypoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"install"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;appwrite/appwrite:0.11.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#windows-powershell"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Windows PowerShell
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight powershell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;${pwd}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;--entrypoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"install"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;appwrite/appwrite:0.11.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also find detailed installation instructions on the Appwrite official &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/installation"&gt;installation docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%EF%B8%8F-activate-swift-functions-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔓️ Activate Swift Functions Environment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the Swift environment to be available in Appwrite Cloud Functions, you need to enable it. It can easily be done using the environment variables. In the Appwrite installation folder  find &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file. In the file find the environment variable &lt;code&gt;_APP_FUNCTIONS_RUNTIMES&lt;/code&gt; and there in the comma separated list add &lt;code&gt;swift-5.5&lt;/code&gt; to make Swift environment available in the Appwrite Functions. After that, you can load updated configuration using &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initialize-function-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔑 Initialize Function Project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a project folder where you will create all the necessary files for your function. We will call this folder &lt;code&gt;storage-cleaner&lt;/code&gt;. Inside run the following command to create a new Swift project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:/app &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-w&lt;/span&gt; /app swift:5.5 swift package init StorageCleaner
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will initialize a new Swift package project. It should create bunch of files, important ones to notice are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── Sources/StorageCleaner/main.swift
└── Package.swift
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-appwrite-swift-sdk-dependency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ➕ Add Appwrite Swift SDK dependency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;storage-cleaner&lt;/code&gt; folder in your favorite text editor. Add the following code to &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;PackageDescription&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"StorageCleaner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-swift"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"0.1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//TODO update version&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;targets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;executableTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"StorageCleaner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Appwrite"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"sdk-for-swift"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;testTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"StorageCleanerTests"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"StorageCleaner"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we are adding Appwrite sdk for swift under dependencies as well as under executable target dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#write-your-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✍️  Write your Function
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;Sources/StorageCleaner/main.swift&lt;/code&gt; and update it with the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight swift"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Foundation&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;cleanStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                            &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;deletedFiles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;leave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;leave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Total files deleted: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;deletedFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;try!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;cleanStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The environment variables that we are accessing here are either already available or are later set on the Appwrite Function's settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚙️ Build
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deploy this to Appwrite Functions, we need to build the project. Our runtime is based on the slim version of official Swift docker image so we will use the official Swift docker image to build our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the terminal in the &lt;code&gt;storage-cleaner&lt;/code&gt; directory, run the following command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:/app &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-w&lt;/span&gt; /app swift:5.5 swift build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This should build the project. Ensure that your folder structure looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── .build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/StorageCleaner
├── Sources/StorageCleaner/main.swift
└── Package.swift
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There might be other files and folders as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-function-in-your-appwrite-console"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ☁️ Create a Function in Your Appwrite Console
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login to your Appwrite console and open the project of your choosing. There, from the sidebar, tap on the &lt;code&gt;Functions&lt;/code&gt; menu. In the functions dashboard, tap the &lt;code&gt;Add Function&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Xo3_kaE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eo6ew64agz0j7pfvrlcd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Xo3_kaE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eo6ew64agz0j7pfvrlcd.png" alt="Add function"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dialog will be presented. Give your function a name of your choosing. We will call it &lt;code&gt;storage cleaner&lt;/code&gt;. Next to the environment, we are using Swift, so we will choose Swift 5.5. Then tap create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🧑‍💻 Deploy Tag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you tap create in the above step, you are taken to the newly created functions overview page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find the ' Deploy Tag ' button at the bottom of the function's overview page. If you tap that button, you will get instructions for deploying. Switch to the &lt;code&gt;Manual&lt;/code&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pwEWH3a1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0tuvysc8gnsexdxwu54.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pwEWH3a1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0tuvysc8gnsexdxwu54.png" alt="Deploy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to create a tarfile of your code first. In the command line within your code folder and in bash go ahead and run this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-zcvf&lt;/span&gt; code.tar.gz &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--strip-components&lt;/span&gt; 1 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-C&lt;/span&gt; .build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/ debug/StorageCleaner
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the tarfile is ready, in the Manual tab in the deploy tag dialog, attach the code.tar.gz and in command type &lt;code&gt;./StorageCleaner&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#activate-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✅ Activate tag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you deploy the tag, it will be listed under tags on the &lt;code&gt;Overview&lt;/code&gt; page. And there you will find the option to upgrade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-environment-variables-and-schedules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  💡 Adding Environment Variables and Schedules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the function's page, switch to the &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; tab from the &lt;code&gt;Overview&lt;/code&gt; tab. A function can be triggered based on an event or a schedule you choose. This particular function will be scheduled. We will schedule it to run every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scroll below to find the Schedule text field. There, paste a CRON Syntax for scheduling. For every day use &lt;code&gt;0 0 * * *&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below that, under the &lt;code&gt;Variables&lt;/code&gt; section, tap the &lt;code&gt;Add Variable&lt;/code&gt; button. and add the following variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;APPWRITE_ENDPOINT&lt;/strong&gt; - Your Appwrite Endpoint (instead of localhost, use the ip address of your machine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;APPWRITE_API_KEY&lt;/strong&gt; - Your Appwrite API key with &lt;code&gt;files.read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;files.write&lt;/code&gt; permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DAYS_TO_EXPIRE&lt;/strong&gt; - Days for files to expire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, tap Update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%EF%B8%8F-verify-its-working"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨️ Verify it's working
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To verify everything is working, in the Overview tab, tap the &lt;code&gt;Execute Now&lt;/code&gt; button. Then visit the &lt;code&gt;Logs&lt;/code&gt; tab to verify the output or errors are as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a cryptocurrency exchange?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies started a revolution in the field of exchanges. This concept that it cannot be regulated by a particular third party is something completely new. The people who are active in the cryptocurrency world are rising day by day and this population needs to use a cryptocurrency exchange. The best cryptocurrency exchanges make it easy to buy and sell digital currencies like Bitcoin, ethereum, and other altcoins. Best cryptocurrencies facilitate the action of buying and selling cryptocurrencies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vSpwFA35--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-1-1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vSpwFA35--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-1-1.png" alt="crypto exchange development"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-cryptocurrency-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is cryptocurrency exchange development?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency transactions work on blockchain to make a decentralized exchange value happen. A cryptocurrency exchange platform allows the traders to exchange their coins with other coins, or to hold them and sell them in the future. Because the cryptocurrency world is getting more popular among the people, it has made several companies and governments from different countries invest in digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features of Cryptocurrency exchange software development
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Customizable in a high degree&lt;br&gt;
• Secure and reliable&lt;br&gt;
• Faster and cheaper&lt;br&gt;
• High-security features&lt;br&gt;
• Admin and user control panel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips to develop a successful website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The website needs to be completely secured. Ensure the customers your website is bulletproof because they want to invest their hard-earned money here in your platform. Hackers are everywhere and this fact is not hidden from anyone so be ready and prepared for their attacks. You have to be sure it doesn’t have any weaknesses or bugs to open a door for hackers to break in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Users are not patient they want everything to be fast, webpage which is loading slowly is a user killer. They would leave the platform for good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;User interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An attractive front-end design will engage users to interact with the platform more. They prefer to reach their destination on the platform with less effort and clicks. A good user interface helps the user to reach its destination and do his desired actions in a fast and convenient way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don’t forget about marketing assume you have a fast, secure, and convenient platform that is working perfectly but nobody doesn’t know about your platform, with the correct methodology for marketing you have to make your website known to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-the-cryptocurrency-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before the cryptocurrency exchange development:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before developing a crypto exchange platform it’s so crucial to know the budget you have for this project. Knowing your budget will help you and the Development Company to decide about the features, options, and customization of the website. The time it takes to develop the platform varies based on the customization of each website. &lt;br&gt;
Gain complete knowledge about all the factors that decide the development price and choose the type of exchange you want to launch. Based on the exchange type and the features, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radindev.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-development-cost/?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cost&amp;amp;utm_id=devto"&gt;cryptocurrency exchange development cost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will be different. The DEX development cost will be different than developing a centralized and so on. Different methods are being used to launch an exchange website which we are going to discuss in detail in the following each of them has some advantages and disadvantages and they have an effect on the development cost. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_dODIQ9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-1-2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_dODIQ9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-1-2.png" alt="features shape the cryptocurrency exchange cost"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-factors-decide-the-cryptocurrency-exchange-development-cost"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What factors decide the Cryptocurrency exchange development cost?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type-of-the-exchange-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type of the exchange development:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized Crypto exchange:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The customers deposit their funds directly into the exchange, and the third party controls the whole transaction process. It works like a traditional and typical bank exchange where transactions take place after being approved. The exchanges depend on the person who is in control of the funds. The centralized exchange manages order books, which record all the buy and sell orders. The disadvantage of this type is that because they are stored in a specific place the possibility of hackers attack is so high. It is hard little to trust the security of these platforms.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Decentralized crypto exchange:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Users can perform anonymous transactions without the need for a middle man, which means it does not depend on a third party to run and control the customer’s funds. The transactions in DEX happen directly peer-to-peer between the two individuals. This type of exchange will reduce the potential for rubbery because it doesn’t actually store the cryptocurrency. But you have to keep in mind that there is no third party in the exchange so solving all the errors and problems is on the traders.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid exchanges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hybrid exchanges have the good features of both DEX and CEX exchanges. Hybrid crypto exchanges address the issue of centralized and decentralized exchanges. It has the usability and liquidity of centralized exchange and security of the decentralized exchange. &lt;br&gt;
Each of the categories of exchanges that are mentioned above affects the exchange development cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer-to-peer exchange:&lt;/strong&gt;  p2p crypto exchanges software development refers to transferring cryptocurrencies that are not connected to the central bank and transactions can be executed without the need for a third party or a central organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trading-orders"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Trading orders
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTC order&lt;/strong&gt; over the counter order is simply the decentralized market in which individuals trade different assets directly between two parties without a central exchange or broker.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stop limit&lt;/strong&gt; stop-limit order will be executed at a specified or better price, from the stop price that has been set before. As soon as it reaches the stop limit turns into the limit order to buy or sell at that limit price or higher.&lt;br&gt;
Margin order: margin order is a type of trading that the trader can borrow money from a broker to purchase stock and gain more benefit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future order&lt;/strong&gt; this refers to orders that traders bet on the future value of an asset with the terms that the trader will buy or sell the assets at the price they agreed on it in the future.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OCO&lt;/strong&gt; OCO refers to one cancels the other order, the name of the trading shows how it works, in this type if the stop or limit price is reached and the transaction happens successfully, the other order will be canceled automatically.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N7rV-raj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N7rV-raj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://radindev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Artboard-3.png" alt="exchange development methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-of-developing-an-exchange-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method of developing an exchange website
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;develop from scratch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 One of the main ways to develop your own bitcoin exchange smoothly is to hire a top blockchain developer or an expert dev team. These individuals will have the expertise and experience to ensure that your project is a complete success. This method will require more time, money, and effort. All the process of gathering a development team picking a strategy will increase the crypto exchange development cost but the investment is certainly worth it. Or you can take control and gather a team of experts or do it all on your own this will reduce the overall cost but in case you face any problems you might find yourself in a pickle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White label Crypto exchange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A white label exchange is ready to launch solution which has a ready back-end and it has a fully customizable front-end. The UI AND UX can be quickly customized as each brand's needs and requirements. The white-label software can be launched to the market quickly. You can provide services with your brand to your customers with less price and in a few weeks. It needs less money and a shorter time for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange Clone scripts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The clone scripts replicate all of the main and key features of a successful working exchange script such as Binance, coinebase, etc…&lt;br&gt;
  A cryptocurrency exchange clone script helps to create popular existing exchanges, the clone script enables the exchange owner to replicate the success of the exchange they decide to clone so the possibility of failure is low because it shows that there are people who need this kind of platform to do their crypto currency trading. Clone scripts are the fastest and safest way to develop a website similar to a successful exchange website it also cost less than starting the coding from scratch. The only thing that you should keep in mind is that different organizations may use one clone script so you have to add unique features or exclusive changes to your exchange platform in order to help it to stand out among its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-time-of-development"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The time of development
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to know the exact timing that you need your website to be developed because it determines the crypto exchange platform cost. If you need your platform to be developed in a week it will cost more than a condition when you have 1 month to launch your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;strong&gt;Extra features&lt;/strong&gt; that will influence the exchange development cost:&lt;br&gt;
• Support system&lt;br&gt;
• Mobile app development&lt;br&gt;
• The user interface &lt;br&gt;
• Security features&lt;br&gt;
• Statistical monitoring &lt;br&gt;
• The blockchain development company&lt;br&gt;
• Multi-language support&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this information we hope that you have become more comfortable condition while thinking of features and factors and estimating your budget, to think comfortably with a wider view through the cryptocurrency exchange development cost whether it’s a centralized exchange or decentralized one. &lt;br&gt;
In the end, everything depends on your needs for your business but don’t forget about the certain key features that must be included in the platform when you are considering the crypto development cost and the budget for developing it. &lt;br&gt;
We have tried to mention all the key features and extra features for you to ease the action of making decision for you in this complicated field.&lt;/p&gt;

  About Me
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! I'm Abu Mushonnip, a Software Engineering Student from Indonesia. This is my first post in DEV. &lt;br&gt;
Let me share my experience in Hacktoberfest 2021 which is also my first time join the Hacktoberfest event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source? We love it! there  is so many Open Source Software (OSS) I oftenly used in my daily (maybe you too). Being the part of it is such a pleasure for me.&lt;br&gt;
I actually want to contribute in Open Source since long time ago, but my coding skill say otherwise. So this event actually a good way to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#progress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Progress
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have weak coding skill, my Hacktoberfest journey just end up in 4 respositories and 6 pull requests and also doesn't contain coding though.&lt;br&gt;
At least I know the basic to being contributor, engange with them, and how it works &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contributions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those repos are:&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/jackjack/coinbase-clone-script-how-to-provide-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-like-coinbase-3f00</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the most up-to-date and targeted cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, Coinbase has become an influential peak for traders. Coinbase offers a variety of products, including investing in cryptocurrencies, a great trading platform, corporate maintenance accounts, various wallets for retail investors, and US dollar coins.&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase was founded in 2012 and is a licensed digital currency exchange that supports all US states except Hawaii. In the early days of Coinbase, bitcoin was only available for trading, but it quickly began adding cryptocurrencies that met its decentralized criteria.&lt;br&gt;
Its list includes Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, many more. It has promised to support all currencies in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radindev.com/coinbase-clone-script/?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=coinbase&amp;amp;utm_id=devto/"&gt;Coinbase Clone Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an encrypted currency exchange website script with a source code and white label that supports all Coinbase features so you can create a leading exchange like Coinbase without spending a lot of time and energy. The most important factor to start any exchange is security.&lt;br&gt;
So you have to leave the design and development of the Coinbase clone website script to a company that is completely based on cybersecurity protocols so that the exchange you create using Coinbase exchange Clone Script is completely anti-hacking and very reliable.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, keep in mind that your chosen company will allow you to customize so that you, exchange developers, cryptographic entrepreneurs, can customize it based on your business requirements and needs.&lt;br&gt;
In another definition, the Coinbase clone script is a cryptocurrency exchange platform script similar to the Coinbase exchange, in which you can start trading bitcoins and exchanging your cryptocurrencies for profit.&lt;br&gt;
the wallet integration feature is one of the most notable features of the Coinbase clone script. These clone scripts can be configured to allow users to trade and easily manage encrypted currencies without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is one of the first cryptocurrencies in the world to be owned by the United States. Coinbase was founded in 2012 in San Francisco, California by Brian Armstrong and Fred Arsham.&lt;br&gt;
That same year, Armstrong received $ 150,000 in funding from Coinbase investors. In less than a year, sales reached one million a month.&lt;br&gt;
He also worked with companies such as Dell and Dish Network.&lt;br&gt;
The Coinbase exchange started with a small business that initially only worked with bitcoin, but eventually supported other coins as well, increasing the number of its employees.&lt;br&gt;
This exchange has been constantly growing and improving its features since the beginning of its 7-year life.&lt;br&gt;
It is worth $ 8 billion today. The exchange operates under two brands, Coinbase and Coinbase pro. Coinbase is more focused on customers and investors who want to buy bitcoins with Fiat currency, while Coinbase pro is a more advanced platform for cryptocurrency exchanges that supports other currencies and larger traders. Coinbase Pro was originally known as GDAX.&lt;br&gt;
The Coinbase exchange is still thriving, and even the outbreak of Covid19 has not stopped it, most Coinbase employees work remotely. The CEO claims that telecommuting has been very successful for the company and has been able to attract top talent from other US states, and not only has it not been harmless, but in addition to high profits, it has led to an increase in staff and better services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-coinbase-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does Coinbase work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users must first register on the cryptocurrency exchange platform. By entering user information such as name, email and then setting a password and verifying the email address you can then create a complete account and log informally.&lt;br&gt;
To start using Coinbase, there are two ways to buy cryptocurrency, these two methods are different, and you can choose one of them based on their features, which are described below.&lt;br&gt;
Using your bank accounts or credit card are two ways you should link to an exchange platform account. The two methods of buying cryptocurrency are different in terms of transaction speed and restrictions. &lt;br&gt;
Users who choose to link to their bank accounts are limited to transactions worth $ 2,500 per week. The downside is that it takes 2-4 business days for the purchased and sold coins to be displayed in the Coinbase account. While users who link their credit cards will immediately show the currencies they have purchased and exchanged in their Coinbase accounts. The downside is that this option has a higher trading limit of $ 250 per week.&lt;br&gt;
If the user chooses to buy a coin using a bank account, he/she will be asked to perform one or two trial transactions. If linking a credit card, users must send a screenshot of the card they want to link to Coinbase.&lt;br&gt;
Once the account is set up, users can exchange cryptocurrencies. Before each transaction, the cost of services and the number of coins purchased are displayed to the user. Once the user has sufficient funds, he can start his business. This platform provides details of the trade cost and purchase amount for verification. Once secured, encrypted currencies are stored in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-coinbase-clone-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Coinbase clone script?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This platform is the safest and most reliable exchange of cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrency market. The reason we offer this platform to you is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coinbase interface is understandable to everyone and easy to use.&lt;br&gt;
The exchange platform is enhanced with security features such as two-factor authentication and registry lock.&lt;br&gt;
The cryptocurrencies stored in the Sur are fully insured.&lt;br&gt;
Fast transfer of cryptocurrencies and instant transactions will save you time.&lt;br&gt;
The currency code can be easily traded with Fiat currency.&lt;br&gt;
Unlike the high costs that other platforms on the market charge, Coinbase costs much less per transaction and depends only on the amount of the transaction.&lt;br&gt;
Having a scanner allows users to scan their recipients' QR codes to transfer coins.&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase offers its services through smartphone applications on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wLmc6CmV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kj3fi011njug0w85pz1o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wLmc6CmV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kj3fi011njug0w85pz1o.png" alt="coinbase white clone label script"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinbase Clone Script is a Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange clone exchange.&lt;br&gt;
This script is a similar version of Coinbase with some unique features. It is a ready-made clone script software that customers can start their currency exchange by customizing and using its features. Customization allows users to make certain changes based on their business requirements. In addition to being equipped with Blockchain technology, it uses additional security features for greater encryption and security of the software.&lt;br&gt;
Our Coinbase clone script has a larger user base and an easy-to-use interface that can create a lot of user interaction. The user interface used in our clone software allows users to trade effectively. Digital currency is becoming more and more popular around the world yesterday, so this is the best time to launch a cryptocurrency exchange platform like Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ViVEhKe6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ah94w1x6bugh445abrd1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ViVEhKe6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ah94w1x6bugh445abrd1.png" alt="clone coinbase app"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#comparison-of-kucoin-and-coinbase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparison of Kucoin and Coinbase
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coinbase has more deposit methods, including the use of credit cards and bank accounts, receives lower costs for the purchase of cryptography, and in today's difficult conditions has made the most profit compared to its history and competitors.&lt;br&gt;
While KuCoin has trading costs of less than 0.1%, trading bots and many additional features are among the ways to make money on your cryptography.&lt;br&gt;
Coinbase has a trading volume of $ 213 billion. This exchange has more than 100 commercial pairs available. Supports Fiat currency trading.&lt;br&gt;
KuCoin has a trading volume of $ 36 billion. This exchange has 445 pairs of available trades. Does not support Fiat currency transactions.&lt;br&gt;
Result:&lt;br&gt;
Kucoin is good for low costs, order types, payment options, but Coinbase is better for beginners who want to pay less. It is also great for long-term traders who want high profits and lower losses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding Prisma to a Next.js project</title>
      <author>Chris Bongers</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 06:39:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/adding-prisma-to-a-nextjs-project-2gb7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/adding-prisma-to-a-nextjs-project-2gb7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prisma is a very cool ORM that we can use to access a database in JavaScript projects.&lt;br&gt;
Prisma works with SDL (Schema Definition Language) to make writing migrations and type-safe code a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you'll learn the most by adding it and seeing it in action to see what we are working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-prisma-to-a-nextjs-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding Prisma to a Next.js project
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's start up a new blank Next.js project so everyone can follow along from scratch.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Give your app a name and navigate inside this new folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we need to install the Prisma development dependency like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; prisma
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we're here, let's also add the Prisma client we need to do any calls.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @prisma/client
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-prisma-to-our-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting Prisma to our database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, I'll be using the &lt;a href="https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/setting-up-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku/"&gt;free Postgres database&lt;/a&gt; we created in the article before this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To initialize Prisma, we can run this command inside our project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx prisma init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will add a new entry in our &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file for the database, and more importantly, it creates a &lt;code&gt;prisma/schema.prisma&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is the brain of the operation as it holds all the information we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open this file, and let's add our first model.&lt;br&gt;
I'll be adding a playlist model.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;datasource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;postgresql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;DATABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;generator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;prisma-client-js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Playlist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;autoincrement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="nb"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the type definition for a playlist is pretty simple.&lt;br&gt;
Above that is the needed configuration for Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then open your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file and change the &lt;code&gt;DATABASE_URL&lt;/code&gt; to your Heroku Postgres URL (or any other Postgres URL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to push this schema to our database. We can do that by running the following command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx prisma db push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once it's done, you can open your database, and you should see the following table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5h06f0Nc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634102529962/QlWhDagZi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5h06f0Nc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634102529962/QlWhDagZi.png" alt="Schema table in Postgres database"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've then added a record directly into this database for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LONjQCO0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634102601841/qd42CmxBz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LONjQCO0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634102601841/qd42CmxBz.png" alt="Data in Postgres database"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consuming-the-database-in-nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consuming the database in Next.js
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this data in place, we can try and consume it from our Next.js app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure the Prisma client is up to date with your schema, you need to run the following command every time your schema changes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx prisma generate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's create a simple API call that we can test out to retrieve our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;playlists.js&lt;/code&gt; file inside your &lt;code&gt;pages/api&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PrismaClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@prisma/client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PrismaClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;playlists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prisma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;playlist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findMany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;playlists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we load the Prisma client and query the client for the &lt;code&gt;playlist&lt;/code&gt; table. On there, we run the &lt;code&gt;findMany&lt;/code&gt; query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in an array of objects.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"title"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Chris super chill mix"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"image"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67706c0000bebbf036b60da9286ccbc023a6f1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"uri"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"spotify:playlist:1E8HDaDy8mM2otQwsFqRiD"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there you go, we created our first schema, pushed this to our database, and queried it through Prisma!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the complete code on &lt;a href="https://github.com/rebelchris/next-prisma"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReLU Activation Function [with python code]</title>

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rectified linear activation function (RELU) is a piecewise linear function that, if the input is positive say x, the output will be x. otherwise, it outputs zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematical representation of ReLU function is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X7-pkmC_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vidyasheela.com/admin/include/../../web-contents/img/post_img/35/ReLU.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img title="ReLU" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--X7-pkmC_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vidyasheela.com/admin/include/../../web-contents/img/post_img/35/ReLU.png" alt="ReLU"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vidyasheela.com/post/numpy-tutorials-beginners-to-intermediate"&gt;Numpy Tutorials [beginners to Intermediate]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vidyasheela.com/post/softmax-activation-function-in-neural-network-formula-included"&gt;Softmax Activation Function in Neural Network [formula included]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vidyasheela.com/post/sigmoid-logistic-activation-function-with-python-code"&gt;Sigmoid(Logistic) Activation Function ( with python code)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vidyasheela.com/post/hyperbolic-tangent-tanh-activation-function-with-python-code"&gt;Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Activation Function [with python code]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://vidyasheela.com/post/leaky-relu-activation-function-with-python-code"&gt;Leaky ReLU Activation Function [with python code]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coding logic for the ReLU function is simple,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if input_value &amp;gt; 0:
  return input_value
else:
  return 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple python function to mimic a ReLU function is as follows,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def ReLU(x):
  data = [max(0,value) for value in x]
  return np.array(data, dtype=float)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The derivative of ReLU is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ithUSbom--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vidyasheela.com/admin/include/../../web-contents/img/post_img/35/der_ReLU.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img title="derivative ReLU" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ithUSbom--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vidyasheela.com/admin/include/../../web-contents/img/post_img/35/der_ReLU.png" alt="derivative ReLU"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple python function to mimic the derivative of ReLU function is as follows,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def der_ReLU(x):
  data = [1 if value&amp;gt;0 else 0 for value in x]
  return np.array(data, dtype=float)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReLU is used widely nowadays, but it has some problems. let's say if we have input less than 0, then it outputs zero, and the neural network can't continue the backpropagation algorithm. This problem is commonly known as Dying ReLU. To get rid of this problem we use an improvised version of ReLU, called Leaky ReLU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Python-Code"&gt;Python Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
def ReLU(x):
  data = [max(0,value) for value in x]
  return np.array(data, dtype=float)

# Derivative for ReLU
def der_ReLU(x):
  data = [1 if value&amp;gt;0 else 0 for value in x]
  return np.array(data, dtype=float)

# Generating data for Graph
x_data = np.linspace(-10,10,100)
y_data = ReLU(x_data)
dy_data = der_ReLU(x_data)

# Graph
plt.plot(x_data, y_data, x_data, dy_data)
plt.title('ReLU Activation Function &amp;amp; Derivative')
plt.legend(['ReLU','der_ReLU'])
plt.grid()
plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create Your Own VS Code Extension: A Simple, Step-by-Step Guide</title>
      <author>Rohit</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 05:03:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rohitcodes/how-to-create-your-own-vs-code-extension-a-simple-step-by-step-guide-94</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rohitcodes/how-to-create-your-own-vs-code-extension-a-simple-step-by-step-guide-94</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Section 1: What to keep in mind before creating an extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.1. VS Code has an extensive API, and most of the most common extensions such as Plugins (which lets you integrate extension functionality with your code), are implemented using its C# API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2. However, some functionality which is currently implemented by extensions can be handled in different ways, such as importing files and helping users with syntax highlighting. Using some extensions can be an implementation detail, and hence, be added to your project in a way that can’t be changed later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.3. For each extension that is implemented, you should know its API so that you can use it to implement your own extension. This includes the extensions for the core editor UI, code language UI and some advanced extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to find out what extensions are already available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to contribute&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key point here is that Visual Studio Code is built to be extensible, built by, and for, you. Add to that the fact that the code editor is open source (or in this case contributed back) and that there are a bunch of extensions already available, it’s easy to see how VS Code is designed for you to contribute to and get your own extensions made. But what exactly can I do in Visual Studio Code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extension Authoring&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example of an extension is a notification system. Although Visual Studio Code has many built-in features to accomplish this, for this example we’re going to build an extension from scratch. Here’s the problem: I want to be notified whenever my code works as expected, but it’s hard to know if my code is working as expected until I see a log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to create a VS Code extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have assembled this post to answer all your questions about building extensions for Visual Studio Code. Before starting this post, I would like to mention that most of the information presented in this post is for Visual Studio Code 1.5 or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post covers all the steps involved in creating your own VS Code extension. This post will go over the entire journey that you will go through from signing up and activating your extension, installing the extension in Visual Studio Code, adding user-defined functions, extending VS Code, creating a command line script to install, and finally, to uninstall the extension and remove the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a New Extension Project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new extension project, go to Extension Projects &amp;gt; New &amp;gt; Create New &amp;gt; Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the VS Code Quick Open command to open your project folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An awesome developer experience all wrapped up in a streamlined package&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensions are perfect for automating tasks, right? Great! But how do you go about writing a VS Code extension for something as simple as viewing the contents of a folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I’ll be walking you through the steps necessary to do just that. I’ll introduce the build process you can follow if you want to go for it on your own, and provide a full preview of the extension I created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing below assumes you know what you’re doing. In fact, I’m hoping you’ll share the extension that we build and have a chance to show it off! I’ll feature your extension on this blog, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition (included with VS 2015 RTM) on an OSX machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Package.json file to list project dependencies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Package.json file to list project dependencies Create an extension.json to define extensions dependencies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extension.json to define extensions dependencies Add ASP.NET Core dependencies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding ASP.NET Core dependencies Start Visual Studio Code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development Steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a package.json file, first you will need to configure Visual Studio Code to use it. Next, if your Package.json doesn’t already exist, create a new one by going to Settings | Project | Generate New Project . Copy the contents of the contents of the below.json file and paste it into the new project’s root folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{ "name": "Hello VS Code Extension", "version": "1.0.0-dev", "description": "A simple, step-by-step guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a tsconfig.json file for TypeScript compilation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all things Visual Studio Code related, read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the process of creating an extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Build a Visual Studio Code extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s explore how to build Visual Studio Code extensions. For the purpose of this post, a Visual Studio Code extension is a .vscode file, which has the extension .vscode. As of Visual Studio 2017 RC and the next Visual Studio Update, extensions can be used for installing, managing and editing .vscode projects. If you want to create an extension for a version of Visual Studio other than Visual Studio 2017, you have to add the below components to your extension project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the source files for your VS Code extension, e.g., .vscode/&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a component definition with your extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the extension once, build and share the executable with friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the same with the Maven-based .vscode-maven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create a New VS Code Extension&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with creating a simple extension — let’s create an extension that allows me to delete an item from an ItemGroup tree. First, create a new VS Code Extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Write a Component Definition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to build a component definition for your extension, you must write code that defines a component class. This class represents a container that all of your components will be added to. This component will also define how the application will be able to register these components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run your extension locally by using npm start or yarn start &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is there so much choice for VS Code extensions? And are any of the extensions useful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with and customizing extensions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to use a new input style, different syntax highlighting, use new features?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets you target multiple devices and languages without leaving your editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even write your own extensions for your own IDE (or your IDE can be your extension)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons why VS Code extensions are useful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this guide is targeted to beginners, most of these steps should be very intuitive for seasoned developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publish or share your extension with others&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extend VS Code with extensions for team collaboration and mobile code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the Visual Studio Code Add-on Directory to browse a large collection of plugins available for VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Start with Microservices. Don't start with Microservices</title>
      <author>Chakrit Likitkhajorn</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 04:37:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/chrisza4/start-with-microservices-dont-start-with-microservices-1mnp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/chrisza4/start-with-microservices-dont-start-with-microservices-1mnp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article has an oxymoron title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell two stories. One which makes a case for don't start with Microservice, one for start with Microservice. And I believe by looking from both side of thing, we will understand more about what is the actual benefit of Microservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's get start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-start-with-microservice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't start with Microservice
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are working for a big e-commerce platform. And like all e-commerce platform, there is a product list page which show all the product. There is also a checkout page which handling a shopping cart and a checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5n2iTDOO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/Shopping.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5n2iTDOO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/Shopping.png" alt="Shopping"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fu66Rhjq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/Checkout.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fu66Rhjq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/Checkout.png" alt="Checkout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, John, CTO of this company read something about Microservices. John thought that this is a great idea. So John decided to have a Microservice which responsible for the Product list domain, and Shopping Cart domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microservices architecture allows John to have a product list team and a checkout team. Both of them have their own business objectives, metrics, KPI, SLA and so on. Both teams are cross-functional teams responsible for the product list page and checkout process end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of them can go wild with what they want to do. For example, the checkout team can implement their own AB Testing with multiple localization and a nice holiday theme on top of it. The product team can focus on optimizing the product list by suggesting relevant items. Both of them can focus on their area without being afraid of making breaking changes to other areas, as long as the backward compatibility of API communication between domains is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we can partially scale the system. Let say we have a big Friday promotion, the customer will browser products and promotions a lot more. We might need a much bigger Product list backend while a little bit bigger checkout page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect sounds good. Life is nice.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Next year, Jane the CEO want to have a promotion sales. Jane also figured out from some research that if show relevant products on the landing page and during the checkout process can significantly increase sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VfZYpiqe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/ShoppingPromo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VfZYpiqe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/ShoppingPromo.png" alt="Shopping Promo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xb-kbYlC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/CheckoutwithPromo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xb-kbYlC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/CheckoutwithPromo.png" alt="Checkout Promo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some specific pricing scheme, relevancy (a customer who buy a lot of IT-related items get more discount on IT items), and customer privileged classes. These should be managed by the product list team since they have done much research on how to display relevant attractive products. Also, the product list team know exactly how to show the product in an attractive manner. They know exactly what color, font, image size and margin yield the best conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this change going to be tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since both the backend and the frontend for the Checkout process and product page belong to different microservice, so we need to share code, design, logic, etc. between both teams. We can do a simple copy-paste, we can create a shared library, we can expose some kind of API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those are all technically possible, implementing this type of change in this microservices architecture required significantly more effort compared to a monolith architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we need to iterate the design, data, and everything in promotion? Every change in each iteration must be reflected on both the checkout page and product list page. If we don't do it right, we will need to double all the work or keep redesigning API between these two teams again and again.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Once we use microservice architecture, we essentially make &lt;strong&gt;any change within service become easier&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;a change across services become harder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jYSNH0yJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/Change.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jYSNH0yJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/Change.png" alt="Change"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we as a human are bad at predicting future, we should never start with microservices. We don't know what business going to expect from us 6-12 months down the line. However we split microservice, it is likely to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's never start with Microservice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-with-microservice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start with Microservice
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's rewind back and see how things can go differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John, CTO of this company read something about Microservices. John thought that this is a disastrous idea. Everything Microservices technically solve can also be done with Monolith, so why add distributed part into the equation? Most of our programmers will suffer from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing"&gt;the fallacies of distributed computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John insisted on using Monolith architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John has a team of around 30 developers. At this scale, it is not possible for John to take reviewed every single change to his big monolith. So he checked the code once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company took the opposite direction: They want to implement a single &lt;strong&gt;Buy now!!&lt;/strong&gt; button, which essentially is a single-step checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SHQaZIC---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/buynow.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SHQaZIC---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/chrisza4/chris-blog/raw/main/content/blog/microservice-start-not-start/buynow.png" alt="Buy Now"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is obviously on the Product List page, so stakeholders ask the Product List team to develop it. One of the developers looked at the requirement. They thought that since this page is all about the product, we should implement it in a product class like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;CheckoutWithOneClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;PaymentService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Pay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a seasoned developer perspective, this is a very very strong code smell. Somehow, this passed through code review, got check-ins, and become the main part of the monolith.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Six months later, everything relate to checkout become really hard to implement and buggy. If we want to be able to apply promo code, we need to remember that there are one-click checkout implemented in a product class. If we want to provide a discount for a special class of customers, we also need to remember this as well. There were many instances where the checkout team was asked to implement some sophisticated checkout scheme, and it does not work well with this one-click button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature development, bug fixes and everything related to the checkout process was implemented separately. And since Product Team own the &lt;code&gt;Product&lt;/code&gt; class and Checkout team own the &lt;code&gt;CheckoutService&lt;/code&gt;, each team interpreted requirement a little bit differently and implement business logic a different way. One might check for promo code first and the other might check for customer privileged first and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John saw this once it is too late. There are many code duplications and separate logic branches between &lt;code&gt;CheckoutWithOneClick&lt;/code&gt; and the normal checkout process. It would take quite a significant investment to refactor this piece of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, John was fired and Jane hired a new CTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question Jane asked was: Why is it so hard for us to do anything in the checkout process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New CTO: Well, there is a different logic implemented in one-click checkout and normal checkout. This makes it hard to do anything in the checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane: How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random Engineer in the team: Everyone know about this. It's started by one of the developers decide to have separate logic for one-button check-in. That's bad, but I don't know how John could do it better. He could not possibly check every piece of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New CTO: Well, John should have started with Microservice. That way, the product list team would never be able to come up with this design. They would be blocked by Checkout team service ownership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-value-of-microservice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The value of Microservice
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, John was in a weird situation. Doom if he used Microservice, also doom if he didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because essentially, Microservice is a management tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microservice prevent some type of changes and enable some type of changes to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first example, the Microservice architecture prevents desirable changes. In the second example, the lack of Microservices architecture enables an undesirable set of changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why John is doomed either way. The problem is not about Monolith vs. Microservice. The problem is about architecture choice misalignment with business growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you can argue that in the second story John can work harder and make sure all the code have design review and throughout audit and etc. But that’s the point. That kind of management solution can be costly and add a lot of overhead into the development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microservice can reduce that cost by making it inherently hard to mess the design up so we don’t need all those heavy processes. But when we actually want to mess the design up for a good reason, well… you got the scenario in the first story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the architecture must align with business growth. That is all to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use microservice, you enable some set of growth to be easier and simultaneously disable some type of growth to be harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a checkout microservice, the checkout team would be able to churn out new features much faster. They can release on their own. They can use a programming language they prefer. They don't depend on the other team. They can manage the scalability of their service independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, what I believe, the core benefit of microservice architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every technical aspect of Microservice, such as independently scale some part of the system or using multi-language implementation, can be solved using Monolith. You can use a build and configure it to open a specific endpoint for some containers and there you go independently scaling just a part of the system. You can use cross-process communication at the OS level and manage binary distribution and there you go, multi-language implementation. The latency might be even better than the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Monolith cannot solve is when you want to have a certain type of management structure and incentivize growth and creativity in a certain area by giving autonomy and a frequent independent release cycle. That is what really really hard to do in Monolith architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would say the deciding factor for Microservice implementation: Is it aligned with how your organization want to grow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because again, Microservice essentially is a technical solution to the management problem. And it is a real problem that requires a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think it is a stupid management problem, well I invite you to try solve that. If you can solve just a simple question of "how to make programmers collaborate effectively?" in a scalable and repeatable way, I believe you have the potential to be richer than Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has been working on this. Google has been working on this. Facebook has been working on this. Every behemoth tech company in existence have been working on this for decades and they came up with Microservice stuff. If you have a better answer, then go ahead, let me and all those guys know. They are ready to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
