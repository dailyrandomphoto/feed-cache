      <title>4 Reasons Why Data Engineers Hate Google Tag Manager</title>
      <author>RudderStack</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 12:53:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rudderstack/4-reasons-why-data-engineers-hate-google-tag-manager-5h6c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rudderstack/4-reasons-why-data-engineers-hate-google-tag-manager-5h6c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GTM is a code injector. Browsers generally view code injectors negatively because they can easily become a weak link through which hackers can plant malicious code in a website or app. As a result, GTM is blocked by most ad blockers and browser privacy tools. It is estimated that¬†&lt;a href="https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users"&gt;42.7% of internet users&lt;/a&gt;¬†use ad blockers, meaning you could be missing anywhere from¬†&lt;a href="https://blog.atinternet.com/en/rocking-your-web-analytics-in-the-face-of-ad-blockers/"&gt;8% to 25%&lt;/a&gt;¬†of user traffic data if you're using GTM. If your entire mar-tech stack is delivered through GTM and it's blocked, you'll run into some serious challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years,¬†&lt;a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/"&gt;Google Tag Manager&lt;/a&gt;¬†(GTM) has made it easy for marketers and analysts to install and manage third-party analytics and marketing tools on their websites and apps. It provides a centralized platform allowing non-technical team members to add, edit, and disable tags without having to touch the source code. This means they don't have to bug you to add new tags or edit existing ones in the event of an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as you know, putting such power in the hands of non-technical teams has the potential to backfire. Whatever they inject into the app or website via GTM bypasses your usual development and QA processes, which could result in a mess the data team has to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while GTM is a useful tool, its shortcomings are quickly apparent to modern data-driven companies. Data engineers hate GTM and for good reason. Its susceptibility to ad blockers and proneness for misuse are just a start. Here, we'll detail four of the driving reasons GTM and data engineers don't get along, and we'll offer a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f3uKosUd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/97bpcflt/production/a6438c440c2fdc134ef787b7bcfb0adea0a3922e-503x496.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f3uKosUd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.sanity.io/images/97bpcflt/production/a6438c440c2fdc134ef787b7bcfb0adea0a3922e-503x496.png" alt="GTM and Data Engineers" width="503" height="496"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-gtm-is-a-codeinjection-tool-prone-to-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. GTM is a code-injection tool prone to security vulnerabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since GTM is a code injection tool, it's not only blocked by ad blockers. It also opens up your site to exploitation because its ability to insert code could open the door to hackers. If a hacker gains access to your GTM account, they can wreak havoc behind the scenes by adding a few lines of seemingly harmless code. Often, this code will go unnoticed because it doesn't affect the look or functionality of the website/app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, your site or mobile app could be used to display unwanted advertising to generate revenue for the hacker, or they could redirect visitors to other sites filled with ads. In worst-case scenarios, your site/app could be exploited to steal PII. Both¬†&lt;a href="https://joom.team/en/why-is-there-a-strange-gtm-tag-in-the-code-of-my-joomla-site"&gt;Joom team&lt;/a&gt;¬†and¬†&lt;a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/04/malicious-activities-google-tag-manager.html"&gt;Securi&lt;/a&gt;¬†documented many instances of this among their clientele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security exploitation like this causes loopholes that will affect your ability to deliver quality data to the teams that need it, and fixing these issues is time-consuming and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-it-has-limited-support-for-the-variety-of-tools-datadriven-businesses-need"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. It has limited support for the variety of tools data-driven businesses need
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Tag Manager provides¬†&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106924?hl=en"&gt;native support&lt;/a&gt;¬†for ads and analytics networks. While it offers more support options for websites, it supports less than 12 tools for mobile apps. So, when it comes to integrations with tools across your stack, GTM simply falls short. To send events to tools for things like A/B testing, nurturing, customer engagement, and support, you'll have to come up with workarounds to integrate unsupported tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you're managing an event-driven tool like Mixpanel via GTM using custom code, you may want to use another event-driven tool like Intercom down the line. Using GTM means you have to write custom code yet again to send the same sets of data to Intercom. And whenever any tool updates its API, you'll have to go back in to update your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-it-slows-site-performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. It slows site performance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not properly managed, GTM can add a serious performance burden to your digital properties. This can happen if the tag manager container has accumulated tags over time, perhaps through experimentation with different publishers or asset integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation directions from a lot of third-party tracking pixels are just "make sure it fires on every page". So, less experienced GTM users often add more and more of those tags with the default "all pages - pageview" trigger which runs very early in the browser's rendering process, while it is still loading and parsing critical resources for the actual website ( such as HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos, etc.). What makes this worse is that, by default, tags are essentially treated as separate scripts. So, if there are 50 tags managed via GTM, the browser now tries to load a webpage and 50 different scripts simultaneously each time a user visits a new page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While users on midrange machines with a fast internet connection may not experience severe performance drops, users on older/weaker machines or mobile devices with slower connections will. For every page load, these weaker devices will do as much as their CPU power permits and then queue up the rest, locking up the browser window and rendering the website inoperable until all of that processing is completed. This not only results in a terrible user experience, it also affects your¬†&lt;a href="https://web.dev/vitals/"&gt;Core Web Vitals&lt;/a&gt;¬†scores (especially the First Input Delay), which will inadvertently affect site ranking on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilianwerner"&gt;Maximilian Werner&lt;/a&gt;, founder of¬†&lt;a href="https://www.obsessiveanalytics.com/"&gt;Obsessive Analytics Consulting&lt;/a&gt;, who has significant experience working with GTM, has seen this firsthand. "I had a client once where GTM caused the web pages to freeze for about 10 seconds on load because they had more than 120 tags firing on page load. Mobile devices basically crashed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-its-difficult-to-manage-user-state-at-scale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. It's difficult to manage user state at scale
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GTM uses a global JS window variable called a dataLayer to maintain something similar to an intermittent state. It can only keep track of variables on the current page. This means it cannot persist user state across pages on the same domain, let alone across domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, assume that the checkout process of an e-commerce website is spread out across four pages: cart, personal info, payment info, and confirmation. When a user enters their name and email on the personal info page, and you use¬†&lt;code&gt;dataLayer.push({name: 'john doe', email: "johndoe@domain.com" })&lt;/code&gt;¬†to store that info either manually or through code automatically run by the ecommerce site (if they offer integration with GTM), then you can use that info on that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the user navigates to the next page, the¬†&lt;code&gt;dataLayer&lt;/code&gt;¬†is wiped clean since it's just a window variable, and you will no longer have access to that info. To carry the data over to the next page, you must persist the data yourself by writing custom JS to store it in a cookie or localStorage, and then read it out on the next page. This adds many more points of failure and stops you from adequately accounting for users joining funnels at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#theres-a-better-alternative-to-google-tag-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There's a better alternative to Google Tag Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GTM simply can't meet the demands of the growing data-driven business - especially as data stacks become more complex. For a flexible and scalable solution that unlocks advanced use cases, you'll need a more robust tool like RudderStack for data integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With RudderStack, you don't have to worry about security exploitations because RudderStack does not inject code into your website. You also don't have to worry about ad blockers---RudderStack uses a¬†&lt;a href="https://www.obsessiveanalytics.com/blog/making-rudder-stack-ad-blocker-proof-in-66-lines-of-code"&gt;proxied RudderStack and server-to-server integrations&lt;/a&gt;. And when it comes to support for tools, RudderStack offers¬†&lt;a href="https://rudderstack.com/integration"&gt;integrations&lt;/a&gt;¬†for more than 200. With integrations ranging from ad networks and corporate communications to attribution and marketing tools, RudderStack enables you to easily integrate the tools you already use, and it gives you flexibility as your stack grows to meet new business demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RudderStack also makes your life a lot easier when it comes to keeping user session data intact, especially across different visits because it persists user state and makes it accessible anytime via¬†&lt;code&gt;rudderanalytics.getUserProperties()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, RudderStack gives you the ability to give every team the customer data they need. Instrument once with RudderStack's SDKs, then automatically send data to your warehouse and business tools. No more dealing with API changes and broken pipelines. You can even use GTM through RudderStack. So, if you want to keep using Google Tag Manager to manage your ad pixels and other Google-related tools, you can integrate it with RudderStack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>The 7 Step Process I Used To Build A Landing Page To Promote My Book</title>
      <author>Mishacreatrix</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 12:47:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mishacreatrix/the-7-step-process-i-used-to-build-a-landing-page-to-promote-my-book-187o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mishacreatrix/the-7-step-process-i-used-to-build-a-landing-page-to-promote-my-book-187o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A custom landing page is an invaluable asset to have as a creator online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It acts as your own little space on the internet to promote something you've created. It shows your audience what your product is and how it can benefit them. It's also a place for people to buy your product directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, more and more people are moving away from the default landing pages services like Gumroad offer in favor of unique and highly customized options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of creating a custom landing page today has never been easier. You just need some time and a little knowledge of landing pages and you can create something that will encourage sign-ups and purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I share with you the exact 7 step process I used to build the landing page for my latest eBook: Design Faster, Design Better. This landing page is used to drive sales and inform potential readers what the book is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow along with this post to learn how to create your own landing page from scratch. This implementation is FREE and requires knowledge of web development (HTML, CSS, Tailwind) but there are no-code options out there which I'll mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the landing page I created to promote my &lt;a href="https://designfaster.netlify.app/"&gt;Design Faster, Design Better - Landing Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-define-a-goal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 - Define A Goal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've no doubt heard this before but you need to take the time to write down the goal of your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I've skipped this step in the past only to realize how much time and effort would have been saved if I had taken the time to understand the meaning behind what I was creating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much value in physically writing down the goal of your landing page: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll focus your mind on what you're doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your mind will continue to work on this in the background so you'll come up with excellent ideas when it comes time to write them down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll understand your intrinsic motivations for wanting to build the landing page. This allows you to continue working even when things get tough. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of goals you might have for your landing page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To sell an eBook all about growing on social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make enough money to buy a new laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To help people who struggle with low motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To encourage people to sign up for my newsletter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, your goal can be whatever you want, the more specific the better as this will help you when you do your research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also important to focus on one goal per landing page. Any more than one goal and your message becomes lost. Stick with one main goal and your message will be more direct and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the goal I picked: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My goal is to create a custom landing page to promote my new eBook - Design Faster, Design Better. I want readers to learn about exactly what my book will help with and allow them to buy it if they would like. I'd like to achieve this at a low cost and I'd like to build the landing page myself from scratch to practice my web dev skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-perform-research"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 - Perform Research
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is likely where you'll spend the most time and that is: doing research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your goal in mind there are a few key areas you'll need to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your target audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you want to say - your message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing effective copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landing page designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#target-audience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Target Audience
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal and the product you're selling should help you to hone in on your target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of great resources out there to help you with this process, here are some examples I would recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marketingevolution.com/marketing-essentials/target-audience"&gt;Steps to Find Your Target Audience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/target-audience"&gt;How to Find Your Target Audience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.singlemindconsulting.com/blog/ux-identifying-your-target-audience/"&gt;UX: Identifying Your Target Audience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of researching and digging into my social media, I felt my target audience for my book is: &lt;em&gt;people looking to improve their design skills productively.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to keep this relatively open as I believe anyone can make use of design knowledge to improve what they're working on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-effective-copy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing Effective Copy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest, copywriting wasn't and still isn't my strongest suit. With that said, I've done enough research and practice to be competent at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can write effective copy, you certainly can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, Twitter is an excellent resource for finding amazing people that share everything they know about writing copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notable examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmoserr"&gt;Jeremy Moser - @jmoserr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Charles_SEO"&gt;Charles Floate - @Charles_SEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx"&gt;Alex Garcia - @alexgarcia_atx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77"&gt;Nicolas Cole - @Nicolascole77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#your-message"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Your Message
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your message or what you want to say goes hand in hand with learning how to write compelling copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you research copywriting techniques, try to apply what you learn to your own message and what you want to say on your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend starting a blank page or a new file somewhere and writing everything you can think of about your product. You can always refine it and cherry-pick the best stuff when you're ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will take some time but if you remain patient and consistent you'll end up with a repository of writing to draw from when you start writing the actual copy for your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also re-purpose this copy in other ways. For instance: with social media posts, blog posts, videos, podcasts. It's worth taking the time to write everything down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#landing-page-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Landing Page Design
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a lot more confident with web page design than I am with copywriting so this one was great fun to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal here is to find a number of landing page designs that you like or find interesting. You can then take the best parts of each design and emulate them to create your own unique landing page design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I wanted the challenge of building a page from scratch so I went down this route. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, there's always the option to simply buy a landing page template. You can easily find a well-designed landing page to fit your needs at a reasonable price so you don't have to worry about this step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some great sources of inspiration I used to find great landing page design ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-write-the-copy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 - Write The Copy
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you've done your research, know what you want to say, and have a general idea of the layout of your landing page, it's time to write!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you've been following along with me, you'll have a file filled with potential copy to use so this makes your life a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend writing the copy before you start designing your landing page as you can easily get distracted by design elements when you should be focusing on writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start a new document and write out the headings of your content. Then fill out each section with copy. Don't worry about this being perfect, you'll have plenty of opportunities to come back and refine things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of my rough copy layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hero section, 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title: Create Brilliant Designs In Half The Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subtitle: Improve Your Design Skills, Learn How To Prevent Burnout, Unlock Unlimited Creativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call to action: Get My Copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the pain point I'm trying to solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does my book solve this problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter Breakdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Sample

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download My Free Sample&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final CTA

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve your design skills, learn how to prevent burnout, and unlock unlimited creativity with Design Faster, Design Better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get My Copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-design-build-the-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 - Design + Build The Structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your copy ready to go, it's time to design and build your landing page structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built my landing page using HTML, CSS, &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt;, and hosted it for free on &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. This solution worked well for me as it allowed for complete customization and free hosting (with a Netlify domain name for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, there are a number of no-code, low-code options that would work equally as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-built templates on &lt;a href="https://themeforest.net/"&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://carrd.co/"&gt;Carrd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://webflow.com/"&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fromnotion.com/"&gt;fromNotion - build a landing page using Notion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of which option to choose, I would recommend sticking with what you know. If there's a tool or programming stack you're familiar with, just use that if it will get the job done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't over-complicate things by trying to learn a completely new piece of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no clue where to start, Carrd is a great option.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-deploy-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5 - Deploy + Test
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've built your landing page it's time to hit publish! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part was extremely hard for me as I always found small tweaks to make or typos that needed to be corrected before I made the landing page live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I'd recommend giving yourself a realistic launch date to work towards. This also allows you to build hype in your community about your new landing page ahead of its launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have launched the website it's important to make sure it works well on different screen sizes. In this day and age, a website should work well on most phones, tablets, and computers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to your landing page on your phone and test it out on your computer and ask some friends to do the same. Make any tweaks as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to sanity check for spelling and grammar just in case there's a typo or something missing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to make changes on the fly, it's your landing page and you can do what you want with it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-6-iterate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6 - Iterate
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've been following along you should now have a brand new live landing page. Congrats!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to send a post to your following on social media or your newsletter to encourage them to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind though, your work doesn't necessarily end here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first iteration should be good enough to publish. But over time you'll see things that can be improved, things that can be added, and things that should be removed from your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to make updates based on what you continue to learn about landing page design.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-7-continually-improve-over-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 7 - Continually Improve Over Time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're landing page may never be 100% perfect but that's OK. Realize that you will continue to learn and build your skills over time and you can apply that knowledge to improving your landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my landing page, for instance, there are no customer testimonials or reviews of my book yet which is something I'm eager to include. I'd also love to eventually add my book to Amazon via KDP and include links to it on my landing page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep a running list of potential improvements I'd like to make to my landing page and try to implement them when I have the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the link to the landing page I made once again if you're interested: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://designfaster.netlify.app/"&gt;Design Faster, Design Better - Landing Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-key-take-aways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Key Take Aways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clear goal will help give you the motivation to continue working even when things get tough. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more time spent researching before design and implementation the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may not be good at writing right now but if you never practice, you'll never improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design on paper before you build. You wouldn't build a house without blueprints!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always test landing pages on more than one device. At the very least test on a phone, a tablet, and a computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid to hit publish when something is good enough as opposed to perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue learning!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading this post as it was extremely enjoyable to write. Let me know what you learned and what you'll apply to your own landing page project!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tips to prevent a serverless wreck</title>
      <author>Matt Lewis</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 12:19:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-heroes/tips-to-prevent-a-serverless-wreck-15af</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-heroes/tips-to-prevent-a-serverless-wreck-15af</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been involved in reviewing services developed using 'serverless' that had been struggling with performance issues. Rather than talk about all the benefits of serverless, this post looks at some top tips for keeping your service operational and production-ready, gained from analysing these real life issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-1-focus-on-observability-not-logs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 1: Focus on observability not logs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, or someone responsible for monitoring a service, the best way to easily find and fix issues is through the use of observability and serverless monitoring tools rather than focusing on logs. Although AWS provide a service called &lt;code&gt;AWS X-Ray&lt;/code&gt; for distributed tracing, there are better tools in the partner ecosystems such as those provided by &lt;a href="https://lumigo.io/"&gt;Lumigo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thundra.io/apm"&gt;Thundra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instana.com/"&gt;Instana&lt;/a&gt; and several others. For example, Lumigo provides some key benefits over &lt;code&gt;X-Ray&lt;/code&gt; such as (thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theburningmonk"&gt;Yan Cui&lt;/a&gt; for highlighting some of these):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auto-instrumentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dashboard with overview of environment - lambda invocations, most errors, cold starts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues page showing recent failures including timeouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;captures request and response for every HTTP request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports auto-scrubbing of sensitive data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports searching for specific transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;built in alerting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is still value in logging when stepping through complex business logic, you will soon find that these observability tools are your first point of call for understanding the behaviour and current state of your service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-2-alert-from-metrics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 2: Alert from metrics
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, I'd been involved in writing systems where you would log a failure using an &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt; log level. These logs would be shipped, and another component would scrape the files, and alert based on log patterns. Unfortunately, it is still common to see this same approach replicated in a cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommended approach today is to use metrics. For example, when your function has finished processing, Lambda sends metrics about the invocation to &lt;code&gt;Amazon Cloudwatch&lt;/code&gt;. You can set alarms to respond to these changes in metrics, and out of the box Lambda provides a number of Invocation, Performance and Concurrency metrics. You can also create your own custom metrics using the Cloudwatch embedded metric format, taking into account your own specific context, which can be alerted on in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A starting point for what alerts to configure for common AWS services is provided in &lt;a href="https://lumigo.io/blog/what-alerts-should-you-have-for-serverless-applications/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theburningmonk"&gt;Yan Cui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to ingest metrics into external systems, this should not be done for the purpose of alerting. This is because there is often a delay with the asynchronous nature of ingesting metrics, by which time, you are already aware of the errors from disappointed customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-3-focus-on-async"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 3: Focus on async
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The serverless application lens part of the &lt;code&gt;Well Architected Framework&lt;/code&gt; noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can no longer sustain complex workflows using synchronous transactions. The more service interaction you need the more you end up chaining calls that may end up increasing the risk on service stability as well as response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two fallacies of "the 8 fallacies of distributed computing" are that "the network is reliable" and "latency is zero". Chaining together synchronous HTTP calls leads to a brittle service that is prone to break. This led to Tim Bray, a former distinguished engineer at AWS, to state that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúif your application is cloud-native, or large-scale, or distributed, and doesn‚Äôt include a messaging component, that‚Äôs probably a bug.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of options available to decouple components in the AWS ecosystem. To get a better understanding of the differences between Events, Queues, Topics and Streams it's worth watching this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Jb1WKCLd8"&gt;TechTalk&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/julian_wood"&gt;Julian Wood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm excited at the growing adoption of event-driven applications using an event bus provided by &lt;code&gt;Amazon EventBridge&lt;/code&gt;. Rather than orchestrating calls between components, you can publish an event that represents a significant change in state, and other components can subscribe to these events and respond accordingly. A good place to start here is looking at the talks and blogs by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sheenbrisals"&gt;Sheen Brisals&lt;/a&gt; on how Lego have adopted EventBridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-4-understand-your-timings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 4: Understand your timings
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic article on the AWS Builders Library that talks about &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/"&gt;'Timeouts, retries and backoff with jitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you design a service, you need to be aware of the timeout settings and retry behaviour of all components in the flow of data from the frontend all the way to the backend. There is no point setting a Lambda timeout of 60 seconds if it is triggered by API Gateway with a default timeout of 29 seconds that cannot be increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the timeout within a service, there are also timeout settings within the SDK. The default behaviour for the AWS SDK is different based on the service being invoked and the specific driver being used as highlighted in this &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-function-retry-timeout-sdk/"&gt;knowledge centre article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--naoJ3lNi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8lgo1wfwybif5hlfixi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--naoJ3lNi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8lgo1wfwybif5hlfixi.png" alt="AWS SDK Timeouts" width="880" height="175"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases I looked at, no socket timeout had been set whilst using the AWS SDK for JavaScript. This meant that when a network problem was encountered, the API call would hang for 120 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-5-know-your-design-patterns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 5: Know your design patterns
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After saying that you should focus on asynchronous communication, there are times when you have no choice but to make a synchronous call. This may because you are reliant on an external interface. In which case, if the external API is failing, best practice is to respond back to the calling client immediately by closing the circuit, whilst retrying the API in the background until it is ready for the circuit to be opened. This is the basis of the &lt;code&gt;Circuit Breaker&lt;/code&gt; design pattern. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly"&gt;Jeremy Daly&lt;/a&gt; has written up a number of &lt;a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/"&gt;Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-6-optimise-your-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 6: Optimise your service
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is the more you understand both the programming language and the AWS services you are using, the better the chances of delivering a resilient, secure and highly available service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, I will break down optimising your service into three main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a) General Optimisations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are set of optimisations when working with AWS Lambda functions that have emerged over time. AWS publish a set of &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html"&gt;best practices for working AWS Lambda functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a good knowledge of the AWS Lambda lifecycle alongside associated configurations is essential. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure HTTP Keep-Alive is enabled if using Nodejs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce package size to reduce cold start times using tools like &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esbuild&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;AWS Lambda Power Tuning&lt;/code&gt; tool by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex_casalboni"&gt;Alex Casalboni&lt;/a&gt; to determine the right memory/power configuration and instruction set architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use reserved concurrency to limit the blast radius of a function where appropriate. I have seen examples where this not being set during a batch load has resulted in the entire AWS Lambda concurrent executions for an entire account being consumed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialise SDK clients and database connections out of the function handler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b) Reduce network calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time a call is made over the network, additional latency and error handling is introduced. These calls should be reduced to the minimum possible, and two specific examples come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is where a call was made to DynamoDB to check a record doesn't exist, before a second call was made to put an Item. In this case, using a Condition Expression enabled this to be done in a single call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second involved multiple calls to DynamoDB to retrieve data once after the other. In this case, the challenge was down to poor schema design. The growing adoption of Single Table Design in DynamoDB is driven by the desire to reduce the number of calls needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan on using DynamoDB in production, &lt;a href="https://www.dynamodbbook.com/"&gt;'The DynamoDB Book'&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexbdebrie"&gt;Alex DeBrie&lt;/a&gt; is essential reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c) Parallelise where possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we want to reduce the number of network calls, sometimes there is no other option. In these cases, you should look to run in parallel. This has the overall result of reducing the function duration and the latency experienced by the calling consumer. In asynchronous JavaScript, it is easy to run tasks in parallel and wait for all of them to complete using &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; there are some optimisations that are good to always do since they are essentially free to carry out. Other ones will take up engineering time to set up, run, analyse and refactor. It makes sense to focus on the most frequently invoked services or functions or those that observability tools have highlighted as poorly performing. Always be careful over optimising and not taking into account engineering effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-7-serverless-lambda"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TIP 7: Serverless != Lambda
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that &lt;code&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/code&gt; is not a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/code&gt; was first launched, the configuration options where limited, which made it a simple service to use. Now, with Lambda extensions, layers, up to 15 minute timeout, and up to 10 GB memory allocation, all kinds of use cases have been opened up. However, this often leads to the default choice being writing a new function. If you are writing an ETL batch job using &lt;code&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/code&gt; where you are having to chunk down files to process and allocate 15 minute timeout and 10GB RAM, it is likely there are better "serverless" options out there such as &lt;code&gt;AWS Glue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing better than writing a function which you have to manage and maintain is not writing a function at all, and this way we are moving to an approach of "favouring configuration over code".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last AWS re:Invent, there was an announcement for &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/features/elastic-views/"&gt;AWS Glue Elastic Views&lt;/a&gt; which is currently in preview. This removes the need to write custom functions to combine and replicate data. More recent is the announcement that &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/aws-step-functions-200-aws-sdk-integration/"&gt;Step Functions now has direct integration for over 200 AWS Services&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this removes the need for writing custom code.&lt;/p&gt;

  All of us know how tricky may react architecture be. One of the best approach that I bumped into during my react developer career was to &lt;a href="https://react-file-structure.surge.sh/"&gt;move files around until it feels right&lt;/a&gt;

  and today I'd love to share my approach to setup &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;AppProviders /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;a href="https://reactrouter.com/"&gt;React Router v6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React Router provides us with powerful tool which is nested routes. Right now we may create routes in the following fashion:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const Router = ({ providers }: { providers: React.ReactElement }) =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Routes&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;Route path={AppRoute.home} element={providers}&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Route index element={&amp;lt;Home /&amp;gt;} /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/Route&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Routes&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/BrowserRouter&amp;gt;
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and if our &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;AppProviders /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Outlet/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; inside, it will also render content of our &lt;code&gt;subroute&lt;/code&gt;, in this case &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Home /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, as it is &lt;code&gt;index ('/')&lt;/code&gt; of our precedent route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we want to do is create our &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;AppProviders /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; right now:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export const AppProviders = () =&amp;gt; {
  const queryClient = new QueryClient();
  const theme = createTheme();

  return (
    &amp;lt;QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;CssBaseline /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={theme}&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Layout&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Outlet /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Layout&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&amp;gt;
      {openReactQueryDevtools &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &amp;lt;ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} /&amp;gt;}
    &amp;lt;/QueryClientProvider&amp;gt;
  );
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We could make more levels of routing to handle styles and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Layout /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; appearance but in this simple scenario it's not necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we could simply pass our &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;AppProviders /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as an prop to our Routing where we want to do it, for me it's &lt;code&gt;index.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReactDOM.render(
  &amp;lt;React.StrictMode&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Router providers={&amp;lt;AppProviders /&amp;gt;} /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/React.StrictMode&amp;gt;,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dtEHrJl2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/5137923.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dtEHrJl2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/5137923.jpg" alt="software architecture meme" width="430" height="385"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it could help any of you improving your react architecture-game. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All your Imaginations are real, week 3 Taskforce 4.0</title>
      <author>Dusabe Johnson</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 12:09:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/joshwambere/all-your-imaginations-are-real-week-3-taskforce-40-2m1b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/joshwambere/all-your-imaginations-are-real-week-3-taskforce-40-2m1b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All imaginations are real&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week started with an event storming session, where we learned to brainstorm and come up with all possible events that will happen in a particular project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then from the events, we got during event storming were used to get DB entities and their attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#team-culture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Team culture
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We proceeded by learning more about team culture and had an exercise to do as a team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#communication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Communication
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued with a session about communication learning what is communication and how to communicate well so as to be productive, The biggest lesson for me in this session is listening is actually harder than it seems if you listen well and ask questions, you are halfway there the rest is empathy and there you have it. you are good at communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#erd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ERD
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued with creating an entity relation diagrams from the entities gathered in event storming and make sure we make a DB query that's work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-review"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code review
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week continued with learning why doing code review and how to properly do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The End
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we wrapped up the week with a weekly demo where we presented everything we've been working on the whole week in teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest takeaway this week would be communication is key in every professional environment to work. and in communication listening might be the hardest skill and some people just don't give it much value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When you talk, you are only repeating what you already know. But if you listen, you may learn something new" By Dalai Lama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was insightful week in general and can't wait for the next week &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS Key Management Service Best Practices | AWS White Paper Summary
</title>
      <author>Salah Elhossiny</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:52:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/awsmenacommunity/aws-key-management-service-best-practices-aws-white-paper-summary-3ci3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/awsmenacommunity/aws-key-management-service-best-practices-aws-white-paper-summary-3ci3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that allows you to concentrate on the cryptographic needs of your applications while Amazon Web Services (AWS) manages availability, physical security, logical access control, and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, AWS KMS allows you to audit usage of your keys by providing logs of all API calls made on them to help you meet compliance and regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers want to know how to effectively implement AWS KMS in their environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whitepaper discusses how to use AWS KMS for each capability described in the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Security Perspective whitepaper, including the differences between the different types of customer master keys, using AWS KMS key policies to ensure least privilege, auditing the use of the keys, and listing some use cases that work to protect sensitive information within AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identity-and-access-management"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identity and Access Management
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Identity and Access Management capability provides guidance on determining the controls for access management within AWS KMS to secure your infrastructure according to established best practices and internal policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-kms-and-iam-policies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS KMS and IAM Policies
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in combination with key policies to control access to your customer master keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses using IAM in the context of AWS KMS.  It doesn‚Äôt provide detailed information about the IAM service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies attached to IAM identities (that is, users, groups, and roles) are called identity-based policies (or IAM policies). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies attached to resources outside of IAM are called resource-based policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In AWS KMS, you must attach resource-based policies to your customer master keys (CMKs). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are called key policies. All KMS CMKs have a key policy, and you must use it to control access to a CMK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IAM policies by themselves are not sufficient to allow access to a CMK, although you can use them in combination with a CMK key policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, ensure that the CMK key policy includes the policy statement that enables IAM policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-policies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Policies
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key policies are the primary way to control access to CMKs in AWS KMS. Each CMK has a key policy attached to it that defines permissions on the use and management of the key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default policy enables any principals you define, as well as enables the root user in the account to add IAM policies that reference the key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you edit the default CMK policy to align with your organization‚Äôs best practices for least privilege. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access an encrypted resource, the principal needs to have permissions to use the resource, as well as to use the encryption key that protects the resource. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the principal does not have the necessary permissions for either of those actions, the request to use the encrypted resource will be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#least-privilege-separation-of-duties"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Least Privilege / Separation of Duties
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key policies specify a resource, action, effect, principal, and conditions to grant access to CMKs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key policies allow you to push more granular permissions to CMKs to enforce least privilege. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an application might make a KMS API call to encrypt data but there is no use case for that same application to decrypt data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that use case, a key policy could grant access to the kms:Encrypt action but not kms:Decrypt and reduce the possibility for exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, AWS allows you to separate the usage permissions from administration permissions associated with the key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that an individual may have the ability to manipulate the key policy, but might not have the necessary permissions to use the key for cryptographic functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cross-account-sharing-of-keys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cross Account Sharing of Keys
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delegation of permissions to a CMK within AWS KMS can occur when you include the root principal of a trusted account within the CMK key policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trusted account then has the ability to further delegate these permissions to IAM users and roles within their own account using IAM policies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this approach may simplify the management of the key policy, it also relies on the trusted accounts to ensure that the delegated permissions are managed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other approach would be to explicitly manage permissions to all authorized users using only the KMS key policy, which could make the key policy complex and less manageable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the approach you take, the specific trust should be broken out on a per key basis to ensure that you adhere to the least privilege model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cmk-grants"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CMK Grants
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key policy changes follow the same permissions model used for policy editing elsewhere in AWS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, users either have permission to change the key policy or they do not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users with the PutKeyPolicy permission for a CMK can completely replace the key policy for a CMK with a different key policy of their choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use key policies to allow other principals to access a CMK, but key policies work best for relatively static assignments of permissions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable more granular permissions management, you can use grants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grants are useful when you want to define scoped-down, temporary permissions to use your CMK on your behalf in the absence of a direct API call from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encryption-context"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encryption Context
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to limiting permission to the AWS KMS APIs, AWS KMS also gives you the ability to add an additional layer of authentication for your KMS API calls utilizing encryption context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encryption context is a key-value pair of additional data that you want associated with AWS KMS-protected information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is then incorporated into the additional authenticated data (AAD) of the authenticated encryption in AWS KMS-encrypted ciphertexts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you submit the encryption context value in the encryption operation, you are required to pass it in the corresponding decryption operation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the encryption context inside your policies to enforce tighter controls for your encrypted resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the encryption context is logged in CloudTrail, you can get more insight into the usage of your keys from an audit perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that the encryption context is not encrypted and will be visible within CloudTrail logs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encryption context should not be considered sensitive information and should not require secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multifactor-authentication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multi-Factor Authentication
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide an additional layer of security over specific actions, you can implement an additional layer of protection using multi-factor authentication (MFA) on critical KMS API calls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those calls are PutKeyPolicy, ScheduleKeyDeletion, DeleteAlias, and DeleteImportedKeyMaterial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be accomplished through a conditional statement within the key policy that checks for when or if an MFA device was used as part of authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone attempts to perform one of the critical AWS KMS actions, the following CMK policy will validate that their MFA was authenticated within the last 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, before performing the action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Sid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"MFACriticalKMSEvents"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Effect"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Allow"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Principal"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"AWS"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/ExampleUser"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Action"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"kms:DeleteAlias"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"kms:PutKeyPolicy"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Resource"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"Condition"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;" NumericLessThan "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"aws: MultiFactorAuthAge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"300"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#detective-controls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Detective Controls
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Detective Controls capability ensures that you properly configure AWS KMS to log the necessary information you need to gain greater visibility into your environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cmk-auditing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CMK Auditing
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS KMS is integrated with CloudTrail. To audit the usage of your keys in AWS KMS, you should enable CloudTrail logging in your AWS account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ensures that all KMS API calls made on keys in your AWS account are automatically logged in files that are then delivered to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket that you specify. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what request was made, the source IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS KMS integrates natively with many other AWS services to make monitoring easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use these AWS services, or your existing security tool suite, to monitor your CloudTrail logs for specific actions such as ScheduleKeyDeletion, PutKeyPolicy, DeleteAlias, DisableKey, DeleteImportedKeyMaterial on your KMS key. Furthermore, AWS KMS emits Amazon CloudWatch Events when your CMK is rotated, deleted, and imported key material in your CMK expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cmk-use-validation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CMK Use Validation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to capturing audit data associated with key management and use, you should ensure that the data you are reviewing aligns with your established best practices and policies. One method is to continuously monitor and verify the CloudTrail logs as they come in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method is to use AWS Config rules. By using AWS Config rules you can ensure that the configuration of many of the AWS services are set up appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, with EBS volumes you can use the AWS Config rule ENCRYPTED_VOLUMES to validate that attached EBS volumes are encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CMK can have a tag applied to it for a variety of purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common use is to correlate a specific CMK back to a business category (such as a cost center, application name, or owner). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tags can then be used to verify that the correct CMK is being used for a given action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in CloudTrail logs, for a given KMS action you can verify that the CMK being used belongs to the same business category as the resource that it‚Äôs being used on. Previously, this might have required a look up within a resource catalog, but now this external lookup is not required because of tagging within AWS KMS as well as many of the other AWS services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#infrastructure-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Infrastructure Security
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Infrastructure Security capability provides you with best practices on how to configure AWS KMS to ensure that you have an agile implementation that can scale with your business while protecting your sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#customer-master-keys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Customer Master Keys
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within AWS KMS, your key hierarchy starts with a CMK. A CMK can be used to directly encrypt data blocks up to 4 KB or it can be used to secure data keys, which protect underlying data of any size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMKs can be broken down into two general types: AWS-managed and customer-managed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An AWSmanaged CMK is created when you choose to enable server-side encryption of an AWS resource under the AWS-managed CMK for that service for the first time (e.g., SSE-KMS). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS-managed CMK is unique to your AWS account and the Region in which it‚Äôs used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An AWS-managed CMK can only be used to protect resources within the specific AWS service for which it‚Äôs created. It does not provide the level of granular control that a customer-managed CMK provides. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more control, a best practice is to use a customer-managed CMK in all supported AWS services and in your applications. A customer-managed CMK is created at your request and should be configured based upon your explicit use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rbnUAkQP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23625821/141607731-83fbeec0-91e6-4d36-b18a-e75090acc6a1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rbnUAkQP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23625821/141607731-83fbeec0-91e6-4d36-b18a-e75090acc6a1.png" alt="1" width="593" height="245"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-creation-and-management"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Creation and Management
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since AWS makes creating and managing keys easy through the use of AWS KMS, we recommend that you have a plan for how to use the service to best control the blast radius around individual keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, you may have used the same key across different geographic regions, environments, or even applications. With AWS KMS, you should define data classification levels and have at least one CMK per level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you could define a CMK for data classified as ‚ÄúConfidential,‚Äù and so on. This ensures that authorized users only have permissions for the key material that they require to complete their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also decide how you want to manage usage of AWS KMS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating KMS keys within each account that requires the ability to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data works best for most customers, but another option is to share the CMKs from a few centralized accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the CMKs in the same account as the majority of the infrastructure using them helps users provision and run AWS services that use those keys. AWS services don‚Äôt allow for cross-account searching unless the principal doing the searching has explicit List* permissions on resources owned by the external account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can also only be accomplished via the CLI or SDK, and not through service console-based searches. Additionally, by storing the credentials in the local accounts, it might be easier to delegate permissions to individuals who know the IAM principals that require access to the specific CMKs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were sharing the keys via a centralized model, the AWS KMS administrators would need to know the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for all users of the CMKs to ensure least privilege. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the administrators might provide overly permissive permissions on the keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-aliases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Aliases
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key alias allows you to abstract key users away from the underlying Region-specific key ID and key ARN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorized individuals can create a key alias that allows their applications to use a specific CMK independent of the Region or rotation schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, multi-Region applications can use the same key alias to refer to KMS keys in multiple Regions without worrying about the key ID or the key ARN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also trigger manual rotation of a CMK by pointing a given key alias to a different CMK. Similar to how Domain Name Services (DNS) allows the abstraction of IP addresses, a key alias does the same for the key ID. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are creating a key alias, we recommend that you determine a naming scheme that can be applied across your accounts such as alias/Environment-Function-Service Team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that CMK aliases can‚Äôt be used within policies. This is because the mapping of aliases to keys can be manipulated outside the policy, which would allow for an escalation of privilege. Therefore, key IDs must be used in KMS key policies, IAM policies, and KMS grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-aws-kms-at-scale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using AWS KMS at Scale
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS recommends using envelope encryption to scale your KMS implementation. Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plaintext data with a unique data key, and then encrypting the data key with a key encryption key (KEK). Within AWS KMS, the CMK is the KEK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can encrypt your message with the data key and then encrypt the data key with the CMK. Then the encrypted data key can be stored along with the encrypted message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can cache the plaintext version of the data key for repeated use, reducing the number of requests to AWS KMS. Additionally, envelope encryption can help to design your application for disaster recovery. You can move your encrypted data as-is between Regions and only have to re-encrypt the data keys with the Region-specific CMKs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-protection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Protection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Protection capability addresses some of the common AWS use cases for using AWS KMS within your organization to protect your sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-aws-kms-use-cases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common AWS KMS Use Cases
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encrypting-pci-data-using-aws-kms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encrypting PCI Data Using AWS KMS
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since security and quality controls in AWS KMS have been validated and certified to meet the requirements of PCI DSS Level 1 certification, you can directly encrypt Primary Account Number (PAN) data with an AWS KMS CMK. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of a CMK to directly encrypt data removes some of the burden of managing encryption libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a CMK can‚Äôt be exported from AWS KMS, which alleviates the concern about the encryption key being stored in an insecure manner. As all KMS requests are logged in CloudTrail, use of the CMK can be audited by reviewing the CloudTrail logs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs important to be aware of the requests per second limit when designing applications that use the CMK directly to protect Payment Card Industry (PCI) data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#secret-management-using-aws-kms-and-amazon-s3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Secret Management Using AWS KMS and Amazon S3
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although AWS KMS primarily provides key management functions, you can leverage AWS KMS and Amazon S3 to build your own secret management solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new Amazon s3 bucket to hold your secrets. Deploy a bucket policy onto the bucket to limit access to only authorized individuals and services. The secrets stored in the bucket utilize a predefined prefix per file to allow for granular control of access to the secrets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each secret, when placed in the S3 bucket, is encrypted using a specific customer-managed KMS key. Furthermore, due to the highly sensitive nature of the information being stored within this bucket, S3 access logging or CloudTrail Data Events are enabled for audit purposes. Then, when a user or service requires access to the secret, they assume an identity within AWS that has permissions to use both the object in the S3 bucket as well as the KMS key. An application that runs in an EC2 instance uses an instance role that has the necessary permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encrypting-lambda-environment-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encrypting Lambda Environment Variables
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, when you create or update Lambda functions that use environment variables, those variables are encrypted using AWS KMS. When your Lambda function is invoked, those values are decrypted and made available to the Lambda code. You have the option to use the default KMS key for Lambda or specify a specific CMK of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further protect your environment variables, you should select the ‚ÄúEnable encryption helpers‚Äù checkbox. By selecting this option, your environment variables will also be individually encrypted using a CMK of your choice, and then your Lambda function will have to specifically decrypt each encrypted environment variable that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encrypting-data-within-systems-manager-parameter-store"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encrypting Data within Systems Manager Parameter Store
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that can help you automate management tasks at scale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To efficiently store and reference sensitive configuration data such as passwords, license keys, and certificates, the Parameter Store lets you protect sensitive information within secure string parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secure string is any sensitive data that needs to be stored and referenced in a secure manner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have data that you don't want users to alter or reference in clear text, such as domain join passwords or license keys, then specify those values using the Secure String data type. You should use secure strings in the following circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to use data/parameters across AWS services without exposing the values as clear text in commands, functions, agent logs, or CloudTrail logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to control who has access to sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to be able to audit when sensitive data is accessed using CloudTrail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want AWS-level encryption for your sensitive data and you want to bring your own encryption keys to manage access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By selecting this option when you create your parameter, the Systems Manager encrypts that value when it‚Äôs passed into a command and decrypts it when processing it on the managed instance. The encryption is handled by AWS KMS and can be either a default KMS key for the Systems Manager or you can specify a specific CMK per parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enforcing-data-at-rest-encryption-within-aws-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enforcing Data at Rest Encryption within AWS Services
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your organization might require the encryption of all data that meets a specific classification. Depending on the specific service, you can enforce data encryption policies through preventative or detective controls. For some services like Amazon S3, a policy can prevent storing unencrypted data. For other services, the most efficient mechanism is to monitor the creation of storage resources and check whether encryption is enabled appropriately. In the event that unencrypted storage is created, you have a number of possible responses ranging from deleting the storage resource to notifying an administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS KMS provides your organization with a fully managed service to centrally control your encryption keys. Its native integration with other AWS services makes it easier for AWS KMS to encrypt the data that you store and process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking the time to properly architect and implement AWS KMS, you can ensure that your encryption keys are secure and available for applications and their authorized users. Additionally, you can show your auditors detailed logs associated with your key usage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In-House vs Outsourced Software Development</title>
      <author>Metricoid Technology Solutions</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:48:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/metricoid_technology/in-house-vs-outsourced-software-development-90</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/metricoid_technology/in-house-vs-outsourced-software-development-90</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is In-House Software Development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insourcing is another term for in-house development. It involves the presence of critical &lt;a href="https://metricoidtech.com/custom-web-development/"&gt;software development&lt;/a&gt; talent within the firm. No outside expertise is required because everyone working on the project is employed by that firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of In-House software development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a group of professionals from the same country/city as you, with similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds, who work for the same company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may simply adapt the project to your business by making relevant adjustments during the development phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal experts improve their abilities in the construction of the project you started, and they quickly become highly focused professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of In-House software development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of assembling and sustaining a development team must be taken into account. Working with an In-House &lt;a href="https://metricoidtech.com/hire-dedicated-developers/"&gt;software developer&lt;/a&gt; is more expensive than an external service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specialized project needs the participation of individuals who possess a certain skill set. If the team lacks that skill set, a new candidate must be found. This can also happen if the project is modified or enlarged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://metricoidtech.com/product-development/"&gt;Developing software applications&lt;/a&gt; is frequently not the company's core business. Such a project can be quite stressful on in-house IT resources. Employee dissatisfaction and poor project outcomes are the results of work overload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee resignation is one of the most significant hazards in in-house software development. Companies can leave after investing considerable resources in their adaption, and you'll need to reinvest in new team members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Outsourced Software Development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://metricoidtech.com/"&gt;Software outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; is a business arrangement in which a corporation collaborates with a third-party company to build software rather than relying on its own staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conventional outsourcing approach was primarily used to reduce operating costs, but software outsourcing is now seen as a growth strategy that may help firms drive digital transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of Outsourcing Software Development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most apparent benefit of outsourcing sophisticated technical tasks is that you are no longer limited to applicants within driving distance or even inside the same nation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies may save time and money by eliminating the requirement to recruit and verify skilled developers.
External development teams are generally well-versed in the subject. When new challenges occur as the project advances, no additional members are required because the knowledge is already present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without a long hiring process or an unpleasant dismissal procedure, the team may simply be grown or lowered as needed.
Payment dates can be arranged if required when engaging an external firm. This will significantly improve the company's cash flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages Of Outsourcing Software Development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of project contact takes place via written technological channels such as email, rather than in person. These sorts of impersonal communication don't have the same impact and might lead to misconceptions or misinterpretations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miscommunication might lead to a distrustful relationship. An outsourced development project requires a high level of trust.
A vital step is to find the correct companion. Both parties must agree to acknowledge each other, meet on time, and report in a way that meets everyone's requirements and goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another downside of outsourcing software development is the possibility of lower-quality code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most significant hazards of outsourcing is losing control over how work is performed, managed, or, worse, the data and insights associated with outsourced projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Day 38 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: Styling Next.js &lt;Image&gt; With a Wrapper</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 11:29:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rammina/day-38-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-styling-nextjs-with-a-wrapper-1fpc</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-38-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-styling-nextjs-with-a-wrapper-1fpc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I started to gain some momentum for working on my company website. I finished setting up AWS SES, Lambda, and API Gateway for my email contact form. Now, all there is left to do is to actually code the frontend contact form with proper styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really grinds my gears is Next.js' &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which has a really weird inline styling effect. the workaround is really annoying, which is to wrap a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div className&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; around it to add custom CSS styling. I don't like this, because it adds up an extra node/element for every &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; I need to style in my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--se1mpq7q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rw4zd5pqwjqqthx12ysh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--se1mpq7q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rw4zd5pqwjqqthx12ysh.png" alt="Messed Up Styling" width="880" height="433"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yikes...&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I still don't have my Internet back. However, I will make do with whatever bandwidth I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yesterday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yesterday
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned out what I will be doing for this week, and I noticed that I am being overwhelmed by various interesting things that I want to learn and work on. I decided to prioritize my main objective first, which is the website MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I learned and worked on today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nextjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Next.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coded my services section for the homepage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished the mobile styling for the skeleton layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the desktop version is also okay, but could use some size changes.&lt;/li&gt;
