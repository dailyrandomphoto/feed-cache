      <title>Life at AWS : 8th Anniversary</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aws/life-at-aws-8th-anniversary-2pk1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;8 years ago, 7th January 2014, I joined Amazon Web Services (AWS) and this blog is a peek into the dream-come-true life I have had so far. These are some of the learnings, experiences and thoughts on life at AWS. If you are new to AWS or aspire to join us, read along! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have been a Cloud Support Engineer(CSE), a Solutions Architect(SA) and a Developer Advocate(DA) across South Africa, Singapore and India. I have moved with AWS to different geographies, and made friends globally. I got to work with hundreds of customers in different regions, and many more colleagues who have become really good friends. Meeting them in different countries has been pure joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y_s6n1-B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/umrfldz49aqwcgux91te.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y_s6n1-B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/umrfldz49aqwcgux91te.png" alt="Over the years, I have been a Cloud Support Engineer, a Solutions Architect and a Developer Advocate in South Africa, Singapore and India" width="880" height="390"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many organizations frown upon people leaving teams/projects, here at AWS we are &lt;strong&gt;encouraged to explore different roles&lt;/strong&gt;. I could apply my tech skills as a Support Engineer while expanding my breadth and dive deeper into services. I used those learnings to help customers as a Solutions Architect(SA). As an SA I followed my passion of public speaking and worked with AWS community over the weekends, which led to eventually moving into Developer Advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-little-history-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A little history :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I joined AWS I was part of an R&amp;amp;D team that did Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) on different cloud platforms we had back in 2010. Most of those public/private clouds do not exist today.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was love at first sight, with AWS technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with AWS tech before launch of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and AWS AutoScaling for Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). It led to an idea and a working PoC  which resulted into my first published &lt;strong&gt;IEEE paper&lt;/strong&gt;. Interested? Read &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6701474"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, I had hands-on migrations experience of moving on-premise web applications to AWS - a highly coveted skill at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization was acquired and its vision changed, but my love for AWS and my vision stayed strong. So, I applied to AWS, went through virtual interviews and did the unthinkable - moved to different continent - Cape Town, South Africa. In the middle of culture shock and home sickness, my tech skills soared higher every passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BOl5MVb4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p1qydwrcafhvzexztr4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BOl5MVb4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p1qydwrcafhvzexztr4.jpg" alt='"The growth that I see in myself personally and professionally, has been tremendous, and that is the biggest motivation for me at AWS - working together to build a better tomorrow."' width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-my-feature-in-the-aws-employee-spotlight-series"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h6&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learnings-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learnings :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While everyone talks about &lt;strong&gt;Leadership Principles&lt;/strong&gt;, which we Amazonians imbibe in every aspect of our work, I wanted to shed some light on other aspects of working at AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I tell new joiners, or people who even change roles/location internally - initially, it feels like a lot of information is sent your way and its only natural to feel overwhelmed. &lt;strong&gt;Drinking from the firehose.&lt;/strong&gt; When you feel like it, remember what Dory said - &lt;strong&gt;just keep swimming&lt;/strong&gt;. Trust me, it does get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, don't rush through your ramp up time. There is a reason ramp up time is provided, use it well to learn the internal ways, do your certifications and most importantly shadow your colleagues in different roles. Everyone is busy, but if you need help - ASK! Find a buddy, or a mentor, it will help calm your nerves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us experience &lt;strong&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/strong&gt; It may feel overwhelming to be around so many smart individuals. AWS has a high hiring bar, if you made it through it, you are worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be successful at AWS you have to take &lt;strong&gt;ownership&lt;/strong&gt; of projects beyond your daily responsibilities. It is a great way to connect with the global AWS teams, customers and helps you build relationships. Over the years, I am proud having worked with some amazing teams here at AWS - from being part of the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is my Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to managing 21 sessions across 3 theatres for Lightning talks in a &lt;strong&gt;physical AWS Summit India&lt;/strong&gt;, to owning a T&amp;amp;C &lt;a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/global-traincert-twitch-lets-ship-it-with-aws.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, getting my customers speaking slots at re:Invent, building workshops, and many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons of my life - &lt;strong&gt;Burnout is real&lt;/strong&gt;. Some interviewees ask a question - &lt;em&gt;is life at AWS too hectic?&lt;/em&gt; Well IT depends on what stresses you (and sometimes which team you are in). Here, we are not stressed by office politics, you are not worried of racing with your colleague to get that promotion. Here, everyone has more than enough work to showcase their skills. When you are so excited about the work you do, you may end up not realizing you are burning out. And it's important to pace it. There is a saying internally - &lt;strong&gt;it's a Marathon, not a sprint&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it's important to know your own limits, take breaks, talk to your managers if something is troubling you. There are multiple programs available to employees, and I have used them last year when our lives changed overnight. It has helped me tremendously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone works on schedules that make sense to them.  &lt;strong&gt;You set your own boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Saying NO is encouraged by leaders. You would find leaders saying - just because you saw an email from me that is out of business hours, doesn't mean you have to respond immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this would not have been possible without some amazing managers &amp;amp; leaders. &lt;strong&gt;A good manager is a blessing.&lt;/strong&gt; They have always pushed me to speak up, to be a leader, motivated me when I doubted myself or just being a friend I can freely talk to. I have never hesitated to reach out to skip level or regional managers. It is never considered as an escalation, but a pure sharing of ideas and building relationships. Coming from a very hierarchical past this was the warmest welcome. Being an autonomous individual contributor has boosted my motivation and creativity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6v6rxUhC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1jzwqplq2ymhisws1wy.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6v6rxUhC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1jzwqplq2ymhisws1wy.jpeg" alt="“During my initial years here, when I was too shy to speak up and share my ideas in meetings, my managers always ensured I felt heard. Managers at AWS are more like approachable leaders than a typical boss.”" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life at AWS has had its ups and downs, a dream-come-true  rollercoaster ride. It is AWSome because of all the amazing people I have met as colleagues, customers or community. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🤔 What Suggestions Do You Have for this Discord Server?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the Fairfield Programming Association, we're going to be launching a Discord server. But, we really want your feedback about how you think the server should function and what features you want. We have one of the best bot programmers that there is working on our discord bot, but we don't want the server to be an average one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we thought that we should get feedback from you guys about what you like about the server and what you would change. Also, if you have any features you would suggest, please let me know, I would love to hear them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://discord.gg/r2JnDXvrWt"&gt;You can see the server here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lack of Motivation</title>
      <author>Reece Barker</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 03:07:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/brakysco/lack-of-motivation-p59</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/brakysco/lack-of-motivation-p59</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you but I sure lack motivation to work on projects and just get out of bed sometimes, most of us struggle with anxiety, depression and even acute mental disorders, but the one thing that seems to keep us going is a reconnection with the world around us, I want to tell you all a little story of how I found my motivation back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by "little story" I really mean it, I didn't really know it at the time I was just living life as I usually did and then it hit me, the depression and lack of motivation to even get on the computer, being stuck in a cycle of wake up, watch tv, eat and sleep. I found myself stuck in a hole that at the time to be honest I didn't really care if I came out of that hole or not, however, what changed after the months of depression and anxiety to even leave the house, was a trip I took back home, you see I live in Germany, quite far away from my home in England, and this trip back home did something that changed my whole life that I had been living for months and it opened my eyes and I found new and old passions for things I love and hate, I found new and exciting things to do and I managed to change my life for better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know many people out there suffer in even worse conditions maybe even in the same conditions as I did, and my point here is that not everyone is living their lives without anxiety and depression, everyone and I mean EVERYONE, is just as troubled as you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GO (also called Golang) is an in-demand programming language, especially for people working with Google products. Go is used by many big companies, like Uber Medium, Dropbox, Salesforce, Netflix, IBM, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For job seekers of all levels, Go is a fantastic option. But where do you begin? What information do you require? Today, we’ll talk about the ideal way to learn Go and build a strong portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Golang developer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang (also called Go) is a &lt;strong&gt;statically typed, compiled programming language&lt;/strong&gt; that was developed by Google in 2009. The language combines the efficiency of C++ efficiency and the readability of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go programming language is used by Golang developers to create websites and apps. Working with Go and its full range of tools and frameworks is part of a Go developer’s job description. Most Go programmers also test and debug their code. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>15 reasons why you should learn JavaScript right now</title>
      <author>Justin</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jucode/15-reasons-why-you-should-learn-javascript-right-now-8kg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why it’s sometimes hard to make a choice; either there are too few options to choose from, or there are too many. When it comes to programming languages, there is an embarrassment of riches, which in turn can cause mental gridlock. There’s Python, Java, JavaScript, C/CPP, PHP, Swift, C#, Ruby, Objective-C, and SQL, and that’s not even the full list! How do you choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, bear in mind that as far as programmers go, there’s no such thing as knowing too many languages. A programmer with a grasp of many languages is a programmer who is highly marketable and very much in demand. Upskilling is always a smart way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's Write a Redux Controller for Web Components</title>
      <author>Benny Powers 🇮🇱🇨🇦</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:55:21 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/bennypowers/lets-write-a-redux-controller-for-web-components-4edl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elliott Marquez challenged me to write a redux controller on the &lt;a href="https://lit.dev/slack-invite/"&gt;Lit &amp;amp; Friends slack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag__user ltag__user__id__137797"&gt;
  
    .ltag__user__id__137797 .follow-action-button {
      background-color: #D7DEE2 !important;
      color: #FFFFFF !important;
      border-color: #D7DEE2 !important;
    }
  
    &lt;a href="/elliott" class="ltag__user__link profile-image-link"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ltag__user__pic"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RlTmLbS6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9y-D1XMO--/c_fill%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_150%2Cq_auto%2Cw_150/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/137797/51b85172-df02-46c5-86af-499fcc94aee9.jpeg" alt="elliott image"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag__user__content"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
&lt;a class="ltag__user__link" href="/elliott"&gt;Elliott&lt;/a&gt;Follow
&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="ltag__user__summary"&gt;
      &lt;a class="ltag__user__link" href="/elliott"&gt;I work on Developer experiences at Chrome and closely with the web platform&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So let's get cracking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-0-the-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 0: The Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step let's make a new project and import some dependencies to help us develop.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;controllers
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;controllers
git init
npm init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--yes&lt;/span&gt;
npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; typescript lit
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;reducer.ts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok next we'll set up the controller class in reducer.ts&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactiveController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactiveControllerHost&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;lit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReducerController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactiveController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactiveControllerHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hostUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;hostUpdate&lt;/code&gt; signature is just to keep typescript from complaining. 🤷.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-reducers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Reducers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our controller essentially bolts some statefullness onto a function which takes some state &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and some action &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and returns some other or the same state &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. So let's formalize that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The controller should take that reducer, along with some initial state, and pin them to the class instance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReducerController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactiveController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactiveControllerHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hostUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?():&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-actions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Actions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not we're pretty much done. The last piece we need is to implement a &lt;code&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; method which takes an action &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and updates the host.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;requestUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, as Chef John would say, &lt;em&gt;that's it&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to use our controller, we just create it on a compatible host (like LitElement) and we're off to the races:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/bennyp/embed/abLjmqW?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lit.dev/playground/#project=W3sibmFtZSI6ImNvdW50ZXItZWxlbWVudC50cyIsImNvbnRlbnQiOiJpbXBvcnQge2h0bWwsIGNzcywgTGl0RWxlbWVudH0gZnJvbSAnbGl0JztcbmltcG9ydCB7Y3VzdG9tRWxlbWVudCwgcHJvcGVydHl9IGZyb20gJ2xpdC9kZWNvcmF0b3JzLmpzJztcbmltcG9ydCB7UmVkdWNlckNvbnRyb2xsZXJ9IGZyb20gJy4vcmVkdWNlci5qcyc7XG5cbkBjdXN0b21FbGVtZW50KCdjb3VudGVyLWVsZW1lbnQnKVxuZXhwb3J0IGNsYXNzIENvdW50ZXJFbGVtZW50IGV4dGVuZHMgTGl0RWxlbWVudCB7XG4gIHByaXZhdGUgY291bnQgPSBuZXcgUmVkdWNlckNvbnRyb2xsZXIodGhpcywgZnVuY3Rpb24gcmVkdWNlcihzdGF0ZSwgYWN0aW9uOiBDb3VudEFjdGlvbikge1xuICAgIHN3aXRjaCAoYWN0aW9uLnR5cGUpIHtcbiAgICAgIGNhc2UgJ3Jlc2V0JzpcbiAgICAgICAgcmV0dXJuIDA7XG4gICAgICBjYXNlICdpbmNyZW1lbnQnOlxuICAgICAgICByZXR1cm4gc3RhdGUgKyAxO1xuICAgICAgY2FzZSAnZGVjcmVtZW50JzpcbiAgICAgICAgcmV0dXJuIHN0YXRlIC0gMTtcbiAgICB9XG4gIH0sIDApO1xuXG4gIHJlbmRlcigpIHtcbiAgICByZXR1cm4gaHRtbGBcbiAgICAgIDxidXR0b24gQGNsaWNrPSR7KCkgPT4gdGhpcy5jb3VudC5kaXNwYXRjaCh7IHR5cGU6ICdpbmNyZW1lbnQnIH0pfT4rPC9idXR0b24-XG4gICAgICA8b3V0cHV0PiR7dGhpcy5jb3VudC5zdGF0ZX08L291dHB1dD5cbiAgICAgIDxidXR0b24gQGNsaWNrPSR7KCkgPT4gdGhpcy5jb3VudC5kaXNwYXRjaCh7IHR5cGU6ICdkZWNyZW1lbnQnIH0pfT4rPC9idXR0b24-XG4gICAgYDtcbiAgfVxufVxuIn0seyJuYW1lIjoiaW5kZXguaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnQiOiI8IURPQ1RZUEUgaHRtbD5cbjxoZWFkPlxuICA8c2NyaXB0IHR5cGU9XCJtb2R1bGVcIiBzcmM9XCIuL3NpbXBsZS1ncmVldGluZy5qc1wiPjwvc2NyaXB0PlxuPC9oZWFkPlxuPGJvZHk-XG4gIDxjb3VudGVyLWVsZW1lbnQ-PC9jb3VudGVyLWVsZW1lbnQ-XG48L2JvZHk-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-LFxuICAgIHB1YmxpYyBpbml0aWFsU3RhdGU6IFQsXG4gICkge1xuICAgIHRoaXMuaG9zdC5hZGRDb250cm9sbGVyKHRoaXMpO1xuICAgIHRoaXMuc3RhdGUgPSBpbml0aWFsU3RhdGU7XG4gIH1cblxuICBkaXNwYXRjaChhY3Rpb246IEEpOiB2b2lkIHtcbiAgICB0aGlzLnN0YXRlID0gdGhpcy5yZWR1Y2VyKHRoaXMuc3RhdGUsIGFjdGlvbik7XG4gICAgdGhpcy5ob3N0LnJlcXVlc3RVcGRhdGUoKTtcbiAgfVxuXG4gIGhvc3RVcGRhdGU_KCk6dm9pZFxufVxuIn1d"&gt;Live Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create an ESP32 based smart device with Arduino and MQTT</title>
      <author>julz</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/julzor42/create-an-esp32-based-smart-device-with-arduino-and-mqtt-3lkh</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will show you how to quickly create an ESP32 based "smart device", using Arduino, by creating a simple application that basically connects your WiFi router, then a MQTT server, and publishes a message every five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can use any other WiFi enabled board.&lt;br&gt;
I chose the ESP32 because I recently bought a LiliGo TTGO ESP32 board, without any specific project in mind.&lt;br&gt;
This is the board I use: &lt;a href="http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?Id=1126"&gt;http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?Id=1126&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#board"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Board
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to add support to our ESP32 board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Arduino preferences, in the &lt;em&gt;Additional Boards Manager URLs&lt;/em&gt; field, add: &lt;code&gt;https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt; menu, open the &lt;strong&gt;Boards Manager&lt;/strong&gt; and look for &lt;em&gt;esp32&lt;/em&gt;, then install it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still in the &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt; menu, choose your board (&lt;em&gt;TTGO LoRa32-OLED V1&lt;/em&gt; in my case)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Libraries
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Sketch&lt;/strong&gt; menu, select &lt;strong&gt;Manage Libraries...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install library &lt;em&gt;PubSubClient&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#headers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Headers
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;WiFi.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;PubSubClient.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#definitions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Definitions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's define our WiFi SSID, password, and the MQTT server&lt;br&gt;
informations (hostname, port, username, password, client).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define ssid          "MyWiFi" 
#define password      "MyWifiPassword"
#define mqtt_host     "MyMQTTServer"
#define mqtt_port     1883
#define mqtt_client   "ArduinoCl"
#define mqtt_user     "julzor"
#define mqtt_password "SomePassword"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#global-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Global variables
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;WiFiClient espClient;
PubSubClient cli = PubSubClient(espClient);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-to-wifi"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting to WiFi
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;void setup_wifi()
{
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) 
  {
    delay(500);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connecting-to-mqtt"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Connecting to MQTT
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;void setup_mqtt()
{
  cli.setServer(mqtt_host, mqtt_port);

  if (cli.connect(mqtt_client, mqtt_user, mqtt_password))
  {
    // Now we're connected to the MQTT server
    // Let's publish a first message...
    cli.publish("test/hello", "hello world");
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#putting-it-all-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Putting it all together
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);

    delay(10);

    setup_wifi();
    setup_mqtt();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loop
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;long last = 0;

void loop() {
  if (!cli.connected())
  {
    // We were disconnected, let's reconnect
    delay(1000);
    setup_mqtt();
  }
  else
  {
    cli.loop();

    long now = millis();
    if (now - last &amp;gt; 5000)
    {
      last = now;
      cli.publish("test/ping", "Ping");
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now have a working application that does nothing but send a ping message on your MQTT server. That's a start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another article, I will show you how I use my useless smart device with Node-RED, a Raspberry Pi, and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
