      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/indian-classroom?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask a lot of questions to my peers and to strangers on public forums in the internet. This year, I have been trying to improve this process to ask better questions. Here is how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first of all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-good-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Good Questions?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good questions are the ones which are easy to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal for asking a question is to have the other person explain what they know in a way you can understand. A series of good questions is the key to a good answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: What happens when we strip the binaries? (Too vague and broad)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N: Stripped binaries don’t have debugging information. So its size is reduced ... (Answers with a lot of irrelevant information)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: I see that we are stripping the binaries to reduce its size before publishing. I found that it shouldn’t affect the performance. Is that right? What other implications does this have? (Clear question, easy to answer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N: Stripping only removes the debugging information. It wouldn’t affect the performance in any way. But it will be difficult to debug if we run into any issues as debug symbols are removed from the traceback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem-with-bad-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem with Bad Questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad questions can derail a conversation easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, asking bad questions have often resulted in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the person explaining things irrelevant to my question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the person explaining things I have no clue of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the person explaining what I already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the person not answering the question at all (especially for under researched questions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this boils down to you or both of you walking away frustrated and without a clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it should be fairly obvious why you should focus on asking questions properly. So, here is my process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-are-you-asking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who are you Asking?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who you are asking a question should impact how you ask the question. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are asking your coworker who works on your project or is familiar of the particular niche, you can fairly assume that the person has some context on what you are asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that there would be less things for you to explain and you can build your explanation from your shared knowledge. But it is a different game when you are asking questions to the people of the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had my share of bashing from people in Stack Overflow when I began programming. I get that having a high bar for quality assurance helps Stack Overflow be the go to place to ask questions but some of the moderators are so trigger happy that they will shoot you (your question) down right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, the important thing to remember here is that the person reading your question has very little context about your situation. It is obvious when a person has put very little effort in asking questions and these questions are the first to get the bashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-ask"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to Ask?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of questions or if you think answering your question will take time, it is better to schedule a time when you are both available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your questions are quick, it is better to ask them right away if it ends up saving you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#google-first-ask-later"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Google First, Ask Later
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest pet peeve is people who ask technical questions that can be answered by the first result of a Google search. It shows little effort from their part and now I just ask people to Google it and do not bother to answer until they do their homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain a project called Meshery and one of the new contributors (who came in to get a &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"&gt;GSoC internship&lt;/a&gt;) literally asked if I could explain what Meshery is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a website, 100+ pages of documentation, recordings of conference talks and technical documentation, all sent to the user as they join the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how that conversation went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been different if they had asked me something along the lines of “I have been going through Meshery’s docs and been trying it out locally. I’m not clear how Meshery adds value if a person is already using a service mesh. Could you point me to any docs where this is explained better?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think for a moment on how you would have answered in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing a bit of research can help you build some foundational knowledge to ask a set of better questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Google first, ask later” motto is only good as a rule of thumb. Nothing has stopped me from asking obvious, googleable (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/googleable"&gt;it is a real word&lt;/a&gt;) questions when in conversation with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, take some effort, do your homework and then ask your questions. Don’t expect to be spoon-fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-that-right"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is that Right?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the “stripped binary” example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: I see that we are stripping the binaries to reduce its size before publishing. I found that it shouldn’t affect the performance. Is that right? What other implications does this have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how stating what you already lets you build the rest of conversation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ask this question, you have to spend some time and dig through what a stripped binary is and how it is different from a "normal" binary. The time taken to understand and formulate that question is time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the receiving end, the person will see that you have spent time in this and is not just asking them to do your work. It will also be easier to answer your question building by on your foundational knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vague-precise-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;del&gt;Vague&lt;/del&gt; Precise Questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: How do I use a Kind cluster to setup my development environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me this, I would reply with a link to the Kind docs. But this wasn’t what they intended to ask. So they say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: I tried this but it is not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are million different reasons for this to not work. I am not Doctor Strange to evaluate all the possibilities in a second! A little bit more context might help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cut to the chase and say how I would ask this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N: I was trying to setup Kind for my local development environment. I am on macOS. I have Docker Desktop and Kind running. I have also setup Metallb LoadBalancer and I see the external IP of the service as shown on the logs below. Still, I am not able to reach it from my host machine. Is there something I’m missing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then that senior engineer with years of experience can jump right in and say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S: On macOS, Docker does not expose the docker network to the host. You can try port-forwarding to reach the pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how easy it was to answer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes for all questions. The more precise you are with your questions, more easy it is to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also prevents the person answering from going off on a tangent explaining irrelevant details which you may either not care about or aren’t relevant to your actual question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to prevent shooting off on a tangent is to ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes/no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: &lt;del&gt;Why are we using this gRPC middleware instead of directly calling the required service?&lt;/del&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J: Are we using this gRPC middleware to convert between two different configuration formats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person usually goes to explain why yes/no after this but these questions are easy to answer and I almost always get quick responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are quite useful when you are in conversation with a person where they are explaining something to you. This segues into my next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-in-doubt-ask-more-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When in Doubt, Ask More Questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imposter syndrome is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started working with other people, I often stopped myself from saying “I don’t understand” thinking I would look stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have then come to learn that if you ask a “stupid” question, you are stupid for the day but if you don’t, you are stupid for life (because you will always stop yourself from asking questions, ending up not understanding things completely... umm, you get it right?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means when you get an answer and you are not completely satisfied,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;say what you don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ask more clarifying questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;stop the speaker and ask more specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confronting the imposter syndrome is hard but it has been helpful to me in knowing that &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_cox_what_is_imposter_syndrome_and_how_can_you_combat_it"&gt;everyone else face this too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start thinking “maybe I’m just not smart enough to understand the answer”, remember that people want to help you. You just have to help them help you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learning-in-public"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learning in Public
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask questions in a public channel instead of DMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may not work in every situation but I try to do this more often now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will document the discussions publicly and would also help any others looking in. You can then always point people to this discussion if they ask the same question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Stack Overflow for example. You almost always find answers to problems you are facing from questions asked by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposter syndrome shifts to the next gear here. Face it head-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asking-good-questions-is-a-skill"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Asking Good Questions is a Skill
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And like all skills, it is sharpened with practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking the right questions will help you extract the answers you want. In most scenarios, it is not that the person answering is incapable, but you are not asking the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gotten better at this over the year and I am still working out the kinks in my process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This might be a good post to come back in a year to reflect and improve upon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise this post in a sentence,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make it easy for people to help you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starfield Programming in JavaScript</title>
      <author>Bek Brace</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 15:59:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bekbrace/starfield-programming-in-javascript-3n20</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bekbrace/starfield-programming-in-javascript-3n20</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not realize how coding tutorials on YouTube are sometimes annoying - including my own (no exception 😄), don't get me wrong, I mean it's great to be taught and all but often it's just annoying, you want to watch someone coding in silence and code with them, especially if you're familiar with the language/framework/tech they're using in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript moving background ideal for any space 2d video game like Space Invaders, Galaxy Hunters or Asteroids, coded from scratch in silence in a rainy night here in Poland, and I did not want to talk just code in silence and if you're a beginner - intermediate, you can code along with me or you can leave it turned on while doing your own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was inspired from one famous YouTuber called Takuya and his channel is called "devaslife", he's a Japanese from Osaka who speaks perfect English. The man types in a very smooth way on the terminal - he uses Fish terminal - and never touches the mouse in all of his videos; productive and efficient. I was only inspired by him, and started creating my own videos with my own style, just occasionally not being the main style on the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might find me struggling while typing a little bit, that's because this was my first time suing this new IBM Compatible Keyboard manufactured by a German company called "Perrix".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the video&lt;br&gt;
Hope you enjoy it - if you like that type of videos&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple Digital Clock with Date using JavaScript</title>
      <author>Shantanu Jana</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 15:46:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shantanu_jana/simple-digital-clock-with-date-using-javascript-41c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shantanu_jana/simple-digital-clock-with-date-using-javascript-41c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article you will learn how to create Simple &lt;a href="https://www.foolishdeveloper.com/2021/12/javascript-digital-clock-with-date.html"&gt;Digital Clock with Date using javaScript&lt;/a&gt; HTML, CSS. Earlier I shared with you many more ways to make digital clock. This digital clock has been created with the help of Glassmorphism design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pg6Xjb60cI4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript enabled this digital watch. This is a bit different from a normal digital watch. Because here you can see the date with time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.foolishdeveloper.com/2021/12/javascript-digital-clock-with-date.html"&gt;watch the live demo&lt;/a&gt; to see how it works. If you look at the picture above you will understand that there is a small box where the date can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and date will be received from your device using New date method. Then using setInterval I instructed to update all those calculations and time every second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-design-the-webpage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: Design the webpage
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the following HTML and CSS codes, I first created two circles on the webpage. These circles are basically a part of Glassmorphism design. You can skip this colorful circle if you want.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"background"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"shape"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"shape"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;*,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#080710&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

First an area has been defined which will contain these two circles. Here the width of the area: 430px and &lt;code&gt;height: 520px&lt;/code&gt;. Circle height, &lt;code&gt;width 140px&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;border-radius: 50%&lt;/code&gt; is used to make it completely round.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;430px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;520px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.background&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;140px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;140px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now those two circles have been placed in a certain place and in both cases we have used different &lt;code&gt;linear-gradient colors&lt;/code&gt;. You can adjust the positions of the circles as you wish.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:first-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="m"&gt;#1845ad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="m"&gt;#23a2f6&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-80px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;70px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:last-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="m"&gt;#ff512f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="m"&gt;#f09819&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-80px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RhixQYC8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiyb2i9YyHVgQgNK9nZkDC4KJOgMfwWIngMFNP6jGRB7KnNacCKPsIdWCNVXVYbFQhr189V8p6Sc7lfqGAzpAbRoOubcuwz0DHbNw374RhZmCVPrQG2rVXXDzlTL6-w4XZJ1-cB6zSWOy4u2vf8KWbZK6YBet6H19k33jCP60ndSh7vONmeHV1I7ZtgAQ%3Ds16000" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RhixQYC8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiyb2i9YyHVgQgNK9nZkDC4KJOgMfwWIngMFNP6jGRB7KnNacCKPsIdWCNVXVYbFQhr189V8p6Sc7lfqGAzpAbRoOubcuwz0DHbNw374RhZmCVPrQG2rVXXDzlTL6-w4XZJ1-cB6zSWOy4u2vf8KWbZK6YBet6H19k33jCP60ndSh7vONmeHV1I7ZtgAQ%3Ds16000" alt="two circles" width="880" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-basic-structure-of-digital-clock"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: Basic structure of digital clock
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the basic structure of the digital clock has been created. &lt;code&gt;Backdrop-filter: blur (10px)&lt;/code&gt; has been used to blur the background of this clock.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"alarm-clock"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.alarm-clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;7px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📌📌 Remember, time &lt;code&gt;cannot be seen without JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;. I have used the image below to understand what will change after using the above HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f0mdZ56E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEitexAazO46k5wBz9m5FCZzrIg-7YitNrOdDM-C5PrVbU2e5We48TpQ_Y4B02fGIW_2rRVvNySx07t65SRYqjWpcWu-y9paVdfBb-vClPRCRuk_5wFRyDFZJbbkoDhIFygp2kWuowNr51UGsbA7MWBo-xz5vP92RObOP3YhwSsUi8WmiF1Mun3DKacZNA%3Ds16000" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f0mdZ56E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEitexAazO46k5wBz9m5FCZzrIg-7YitNrOdDM-C5PrVbU2e5We48TpQ_Y4B02fGIW_2rRVvNySx07t65SRYqjWpcWu-y9paVdfBb-vClPRCRuk_5wFRyDFZJbbkoDhIFygp2kWuowNr51UGsbA7MWBo-xz5vP92RObOP3YhwSsUi8WmiF1Mun3DKacZNA%3Ds16000" alt="Basic structure of digital clock " width="880" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-add-code-to-view-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Add code to view time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have added the necessary HTML to view the time. Hours, minutes and seconds can be found here. A colon has been used in between each period which will help to enhance the beauty a bit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"time"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"hours"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"colon"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; :&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"minutes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"colon"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"seconds"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.alarm-clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;19px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;"Orbitron"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;62px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.alarm-clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;flex-direction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#09ecf8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#375f08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-design-the-colon-and-add-animation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Design the colon and add animation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the colon has been designed and animation has been added. In the meantime I have used an animation that will help to show and hide some time intervals.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.alarm-clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.colon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;14px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;blink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;blink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📌📌 Remember, time &lt;code&gt;cannot be seen without JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;. I have used the image below to understand what will change after using the above HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0Rh7ohlM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjcJ7IGSCqNoBQwev_9Utv6v4G_OrRia_MzfZNzYqDRUfxIn_a8pFf0XhZag_AjExxRPYZwfT7B6TH0dJEkw2knoRYScwJex1rjLB737spmjcyXZWem4dvHnxWaMc7b_wX0sZ99_UaqGIOnU800JwKP_QSxsgU92sT2s5N2p9U7npTQVZYTmRjvGbAxkw%3Ds16000" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0Rh7ohlM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjcJ7IGSCqNoBQwev_9Utv6v4G_OrRia_MzfZNzYqDRUfxIn_a8pFf0XhZag_AjExxRPYZwfT7B6TH0dJEkw2knoRYScwJex1rjLB737spmjcyXZWem4dvHnxWaMc7b_wX0sZ99_UaqGIOnU800JwKP_QSxsgU92sT2s5N2p9U7npTQVZYTmRjvGbAxkw%3Ds16000" alt="Add code to view time" width="880" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-add-code-to-view-the-date"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5: Add code to view the date
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have created a place to see the date in the digital clock. As I said before, months, days and years can be seen here. Now I have used HTML and CSS code to create its basic structure. Later I implemented it with the help of JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"date"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"month"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"day"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"year"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.alarm-clock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;18px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;uppercase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📌📌 Remember, time and Date&lt;code&gt;cannot be seen without JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;. I have used the image below to understand what will change after using the above HTML, CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q79FL5k0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj8BGxHBnYilo8nYIGTr63WsWQlx95OFHj9tP0CtSsH10OgszHROyL__BsKUxg4CXCR9Sv1IqZgpkXRcD-eZqW3TtjUnBSVHoSmyPK9tEXZAbhks7wy6TdVnxYQgSBs6RlW6ngfd3xBwr9RnZQ7EwE7njZuM2GHPKDgGbKzod1V-ISVQpAc38Nivhz_qA%3Ds16000" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q79FL5k0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj8BGxHBnYilo8nYIGTr63WsWQlx95OFHj9tP0CtSsH10OgszHROyL__BsKUxg4CXCR9Sv1IqZgpkXRcD-eZqW3TtjUnBSVHoSmyPK9tEXZAbhks7wy6TdVnxYQgSBs6RlW6ngfd3xBwr9RnZQ7EwE7njZuM2GHPKDgGbKzod1V-ISVQpAc38Nivhz_qA%3Ds16000" alt=" Add code to view the date" width="880" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-6-activate-digital-clock-with-date-using-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6: Activate Digital Clock with Date using JavaScript
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above we have all designed to create this &lt;strong&gt;Digital Clock with Date&lt;/strong&gt;. Now is the time to implement it with JavaScript. For this you must have an idea about basic JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First some of the class functions have been assigned a constant. Because I can't directly use the ID function in JavaScript. For that a global constant has to be determined.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the following function I will add all the calculations. In other words, I will add all the calculations needed to increase this clock in this function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the time and date information used here will be collected from the device using JavaScript's &lt;code&gt;New Date&lt;/code&gt; Method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the current information of month day and year has been collected and stored in different constants.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getMonth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yyyy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getFullYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the same way hours minutes minutes and seconds are taken from the device and they are stored in some constant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getMinutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hrs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now I have stored the names of all the months in a constant called &lt;code&gt;"monthName"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;monthName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;January&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;February&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;March&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;April&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;May&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;June&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;July&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;August&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;September&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;October&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;November&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;December&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now through a few conditions I have managed to add one zero to the &lt;code&gt;time below 10&lt;/code&gt;. When the time is below 10, one zero will be added before that time. As a result, the times will be two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then those times have been arranged to show in the webpage using innerhtml. innerhtml helps to display any content within a web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have given the condition here that if the time is less than 10 then one zero will be added and then that time will be seen in the webpage. Then I gave another condition using else. If the time is &lt;code&gt;not below 10&lt;/code&gt;, then the time can be seen directly on the webpage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hrs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now using the same innerhtml, the information of the month, day and year has been arranged in the webpage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;monthName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;yyyy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, all these calculations are stored in a function called set date. Now that function has been instructed to update every &lt;code&gt;1000 milliseconds&lt;/code&gt; or one second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt; helps to update any information after a certain period of time. This will update all these calculations every 1 second and we will see the time change every second.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How does Treblle scale on AWS without breaking the bank?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/cindreta/how-does-treblle-scale-on-aws-without-breaking-the-bank-2m2p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one has been a long time coming. Like really long. It's been in the back of my head for months on end. But the day is finally here. I'm super happy to share the details of &lt;strong&gt;how do we actually scale Treblle&lt;/strong&gt; without going bankrupt in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with many of my other blogs I like to start off by setting the tone with some music. I chose a scene from the movie &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244/"&gt;Swordfish&lt;/a&gt; because it accurately depicts how I worked on scaling Treblle with all of the ups and downs. Besides that it really is a good mix of two different songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u1Ds9CeG-VY"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, like the song says, let's play to the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you missed my original blog post about the early days of developing Treblle you can find it &lt;a href="https://treblle.com/blog/a-leap-of-faith"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In it I briefly mentioned that I dropped the entire project a few times because I couldn't get it to scale. Making sure we can scale at a cost without declaring bankruptcy in the first month was something I knew I had to solve before Treblle can exist. So I went ahead and set myself &lt;strong&gt;3 core requirements&lt;/strong&gt; for our infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; it had to be as automated as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; it had to be globally scalable with top performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; it had to be as cheap as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I set myself up for failure with such high requirements? - yes I did. Were there times I thought that hitting all 3 of those wouldn't be possible in my lifetime - yes sir. Did I give up - 3 times in 6 months. But, and there is a but. I never gave up completely. Whenever I failed I would leave it alone for a few weeks and then come back to it with a fresh pair of eyes. This is probably the most valuable thing I learned as a developer. &lt;strong&gt;When you're banging your head against a problem, step aside.&lt;/strong&gt; Let it cool down. Don't work on that work on something else. Take a few hours, days or weeks off. Just do anything else. After your mind is ready you'll find a solution. It works. Every single time. Trust me - I know 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how my path to scale looked like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#attempt-1-wishful-thinking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Attempt 1: Wishful thinking
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PKEvaBiY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/70q6zzclccjjqsr26lye.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PKEvaBiY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/70q6zzclccjjqsr26lye.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before every serious infrastructure expert on Twitter starts to judge me, I have to note that, I'm by far &lt;strong&gt;no expert in AWS&lt;/strong&gt;, infrastructure, DevOps and all that jazz...To use &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8_eEyjj5Gz0"&gt;Johnny Ive'ss words&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;I'm just an unapologetically stubborn developer with a dream&lt;/strong&gt; 😎 That's how I started approaching scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen many of my clients over pay for infrastructure to our beloved Jeff I wanted something better for myself and my project. A simple, elegant way of achieving the maximum with a minimum. Naturally the first thing I meaningfully started to explore was &lt;strong&gt;Load balancing and Auto scaling on AWS&lt;/strong&gt;. It took me ages to grasp the concepts given I'm this old school guy used to SSHing into servers and messing with Ubuntu commands. I figured out that I could use a Load Balancer and attach that to an Auto Scaling group on AWS. It all sounds super complicated and fancy but what actually happens is this: all requests hit a load balancing server which serves like a traffic cop and directs traffic to one of many EC2 instances that run within your auto scaling group. So you generally start with two EC2 instances and then as you need more the auto scaling service by AWS can add more and more of these instances. It started looking like a potential solution so I explored more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're in the AWS world you know at the end of your journey you just simply end up using ALL their services. The ones that you need and the ones that you didn't even know existed. That's what started happening here. As I started using load balancing in combination with auto scaling I needed to create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) which essentially would have Ubuntu, Apache and PHP pre-installed so that every new EC2 instance has everything it needs. Then once I figured that out I needed a way to deploy the code to those instances. Then I started using Code Deploy and Github hooks. What happens there is when you push code on you Github repo Code Deploy would take that code and install it onto all EC2 instances that are in the autoscaling group. That was super tricky to set up, a lot of Ubuntu permissions, a lot of agony dealing with temporary files, local cache and Laravel peculiarities. But I somehow managed to get it up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent days researching efficient auto scaling policies and testing them out. I used an RDS database, a serverless one which was super expensive but totally worth it. I also started using AWS ElastiCache for Redis which would allow me to connect all the instances to a shared Redis cluster. &lt;strong&gt;This approach can scale but there were so many problems and the entire process was quite cumbersome&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance the whole process was slow. I would deploy the code and it would take AGES for the code to show up on the EC2 instances. I was never even sure what code was actually running on a given instance. It got so bad I started using weird versioning policies to try to figure it out. Then half the time deployments would fail because of Ubuntu permissions, Laravel permissions, not being able to write to local cache, not being able to install composer packages and similar. Finally it still felt weird that I had to write these policies for launching EC2 instances that run Ubuntu, that need to be updated, patched, restarted and that can jam. &lt;strong&gt;I called it quits when I got into the logistics of running cron jobs and syncing them across X servers&lt;/strong&gt;. It became this nightmare of a concept I felt could get out of control very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working on this for a few months &lt;strong&gt;I concluded that this simply isn't what I'm looking for&lt;/strong&gt;. Both in terms of process and money. Because, keep in mind, you have to pay for every EC2 instance you run and you never know how much you'll need. So you can't reserve instances in order to save money. In any case this would probably be OK for the first few months but it would probably collapse with time. It was a good try but not it didn't tick almost any of the rules I set for myself. Most importantly it didn't seem as elegant and simple. I've found that the best things in life, especially in development, are in its nature very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#attempt-2-short-but-sweet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Attempt 2: Short but sweet
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhOInLMH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ioo7mc0rnezmdn0g7a9t.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhOInLMH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ioo7mc0rnezmdn0g7a9t.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second attempt didn't last long but it started by me learning more about AWS Lambda. It was the new hot trend. Serverless computing. You only pay for what you use. It's measured in milliseconds...It seemed great on paper but most people used it with Python or Node. Given I'm a PHP developer that turned out to be a no go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my research on how to make PHP run on Lambda I stumbled upon Bref at that time which was supposed to make that happen. I spent probably a month trying to get Laravel or any kind of a PHP application running on Lambda using &lt;a href="https://bref.sh/"&gt;Bref&lt;/a&gt; but I simply couldn't do it. There was always something: it was super slow and janky, cold starts were killing me, there were bugs and issues...It wasn't something I wanted to bet at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This approach had promise but the tooling wasn't there yet&lt;/strong&gt;, at least for PHP developers. When I looked at this it was early 2019. Laravel Vapor didn't exist and people were still exploring Lambda. I did however like the idea that you can literally run your entire app as a code for a certain amount of time. It's like this beautiful concept where you basically get punished for writing bad code that executes long. &lt;strong&gt;I always strived to write very efficient, optimized code that is above all fast&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;I decided to wait and see&lt;/strong&gt; where AWS would take Lamda, when would some of the limitations be ironed out and finally when will the ecosystem catch up. It's very important that there is an ecosystem of developers around this because otherwise you can't learn how to use it, you can't read up on experiences of others and essentially you will be the one discovering all the early growing pains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#attempt-3-mysql-wins-the-war"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Attempt 3: MYSQL wins the war
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SNLPrB6X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oa530ui9cgneacxtjvlu.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SNLPrB6X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oa530ui9cgneacxtjvlu.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months from my last attempt Laravel Vapor gets released. It was still early days but it allowed you, as a Laravel developer, to literally deploy the entire Laravel application to a Lambda function without any setup or hassle. You develop your app as you normally would and once you're ready you type in vapor deploy production and within a few minutes your application is ready and live. Vapor would essentially package the entire application, ZIP it, upload it to S3, deploy it inside of a Lambda function, upload images to a Cloudfront distribution, create all the services you need and connect them into one working thing of beauty. This enabled me, a regular software developer, to essentially build my own super scalable infrastructure without the need to open aws.amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved it! I thought I finally cracked it and managed to solve my scaling issues. I started testing it out. It had a few problems but nothing I would deem as a blocker. It worked - magically. At the same time there were a lot of open questions about queues, performance, http support, cold starts and so one..The more I started getting into it the more I thought that &lt;strong&gt;this can't be my only solution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear was the database. Yes the entire infrastructure would be serverless, using various other services from AWS but at the end of day I would need to save the data somewhere. And trust me &lt;strong&gt;you can scale everything but scaling a MYSQL database is a whole different ball game&lt;/strong&gt;. I simply knew, I alone, would never be able to do it and the cost of scaling a MYSQL database is HUGE. So Vapor can be a solution if I find a replacement for MYSQL or use something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that I was also afraid to run everything off of the same code base. In case you didn't know, we have SDKs for various programming languages that send the log data from your API to our API. We take that log data, we have to read it, process it, do complicated computational stuff, analyze it and show it to you in near real time. With Laravel you can have a single application for both your web and API interfaces. Which is what we did, our entire stack was a majestic monolith that shared the same codebase - all the models, helper functions and business logic. So I was super afraid that if we messed something up on a completely unrelated part of the platform it could impact the intake process. Yes we could separate our code base into multiple different microservices running on Vapor and solve that problem. But in that case we have complications on scattered codebases and we still didn't solve the MYSQL problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;I gave up this path as well&lt;/strong&gt; because I was afraid to use MYSQL as the only source of storing log data. But this time I knew that we would use Laravel and Laravel Vapor for everything else except the intake process. I also knew that the best scenario would be to not use MYSQL for the intake process at all. So again I took a break and started learning up on various different things that would help me solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution-a-serverless-symphony"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The solution: A serverless symphony
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_o4CslxP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nlaabopfcdczldscnwvw.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_o4CslxP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nlaabopfcdczldscnwvw.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we get to the fun part&lt;/strong&gt;. I desperately wanted to use Laravel in combination with Laravel Vapor to run our entire website as a Lambda function. There are no servers to install, maintain, no code base plus Vapor got even better but given our use case it simply wasn't enough. On the other hand I needed a solution that could be decoupled from our entire code base, isn't MYSQL based and can run for pennies on the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started rampantly researching many different NoSQL databases, AWS solutions like DynamoDB, reading countless blog posts, spent weeks trying to figure things out but I simply couldn't find a solution that would fit my needs. At the same time I was developing multiple platforms for our agency clients and one of them processed more than &lt;strong&gt;10TB of images per year without breaking a sweat&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason why that was even possible was because we developed it, of course 😄, but beside that it was because it was using Amazon S3. The users would come to the website we built, they would select their local images and using the AWS PHP SDK and a little bit of Javascript they would upload the images DIRECTLY to AWS, in chunks if i might add. It was so beautiful and scalable that I started exploring if &lt;strong&gt;somehow we could use AWS S3&lt;/strong&gt; for our use case. I knew that you could upload directly to AWS S3 but you needed a signed request with a specific payload. So I started exploring how we can sign requests and maybe upload a log directly from the SDK by issuing some temporary permissions or credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My path led to many roadblocks while trying to do this but, one night, randomly watching AWS videos on Youtube and exploring how Lambda functions worked &lt;strong&gt;I actually managed to figure it out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The premise of the idea was this: let's somehow send the data to a Lambda function directly from the SDK and then have the Lambda function store the file into AWS S3 as JSON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first step in this process was to set up our domain on AWS Route 53. AWS wasn't our registrar so that took a few days but we finally got the domain under Jeff's control. Then I created a super simple AWS API Gateway v1 that connects to a Lambda function. It has only one endpoint with the POST method. It had to be Gateway v1 and not the 50% cheaper v2 because of one simple thing: usage plans. So I was actually able to connect our website with the API Gateway in terms of API keys and plans. So all the plans on our website also exist on the API gateway. When you make an account on our website in the background we essentially make a new API Gateway key as well and assign you to a plan. Why do we do this? &lt;strong&gt;Well because AWS takes care of all the API limits&lt;/strong&gt;, making sure you don't go overboard, making sure all the validation is done on their side. So no MYSQL queries to our database, no calls to our server - nothing. Pure AWS - all the way 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I got the API Gateway to work very closely with our website I wanted to make sure that our SDKs were calling a more friendlier URI than what AWS gives you. So I connected a custom subdomain &lt;strong&gt;rocknrolla.treblle.com&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it's a reference to a Guy Ritchie movie with the same name &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032755/"&gt;RocknRolla&lt;/a&gt;. Great movie, great cast - you should watch it! Anyhow, once the custom domain was connected it was time to make our Lambda function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the only purpose of the Lambda function would be to take the data it gets from our SDK, via the API Gateway, and dump it into Amazon S3, the most distributed and scalable system in the world. To do that &lt;strong&gt;I used NodeJS, and in 23 lines of code&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote a simple function that does exactly what it needs. Stores the RAW request data, which is your regular JSON, as a .json file into an S3 bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VOILA! &lt;strong&gt;Now I had a completely scalable intake solution that didn't require a database because all the data was stored on S3&lt;/strong&gt;. Infinitely scalable, distributed, cheap as f***, fast and more importantly totally maintained by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That isn't exactly the end of the journey for our logs but it sure took care of the most complicated part. After the log is stored into the S3 bucket I have &lt;strong&gt;another Lambda function which simply notifies our processing pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;, developed in Laravel powered by Laravel Vapor. That processing pipeline loads the file from the S3 bucket and starts as a 5 step process of reading, transforming, enriching the data and then storing parts of that data into a database. This process is entirely based on Laravel Queued jobs and running inside another infinitely scalable and dirt chip service AWS has called SQS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laravel Queues combined with AWS SQS allow us to background long lasting processes and not have to execute them straight away. It's basically like saying: "hey processing pipeline we have a new job in the queue when it's next in line and you have time please process it." Using that approach each log creates up to 5 different background jobs that are executed in sequence. But in order to have the real time feeling for you as a user we show you the log, in your Treblle dashboard, as soon as the the first job is finished processing. &lt;strong&gt;That part is a simple illusion&lt;/strong&gt; that I think even David Copperfield would be proud of. In the first job we literally do only what we need to show you the request on the dashboard. By the time you see the request we are already on job two. By the time you hover towards the request we are on job 3. By the time you click on it we are on job 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lyF9yzFu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ouyipkz1t55ghflardg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lyF9yzFu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ouyipkz1t55ghflardg.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="354"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To process a request and one of it's jobs we need about 500ms.&lt;/strong&gt; So from your SDK to your Treblle dashboard in more or less 500ms. Given the amount of information we give you this is amazing. Just to give you a glimpse of what we have to understand or get: the location of the request, parse out the device information, server information. Map the request to an endpoint, check if the URL has dynamic parts in it, compile docs based on the request, compare the docs to multiple other previous versions...and finally store a lot of the data in MYSQL and show it you in a way that anyone on the team can read it. Of course we do a lot more but in broad strokes you now know what kind of trouble we go through to show you a single request. Also we don't stop and we are improving our processing pipeline every week, trying to push performance to the next level!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you can see this approach ticks all the requirements I set at the beginning of my scaling journey.&lt;/strong&gt; Because we are using AWS API Gateway we are piggybacking on top of AWSes global infrastructure that helps reduce latency and brings our endpoint closer to you "free of charge". Next, we are using a Lambda function with just 23 lines of code that stores the RAW data into AWS S3. This allows us to reach almost infinite scalability without running any servers, any databases nor have to maintain anything. Finally our entire post processing is built using Laravel and Laravel Vapor which again runs everything without any servers in a Lambda function. To top it all of the entire process is spun off into multiple background jobs that get executed in sequence inside AWS SQS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For you as the user of Treblle this means our intake API never goes down, it has next to no impact on your API and we can handle as many requests as you can without breaking a sweat.&lt;/strong&gt; But optimization for us starts on our SDK level. We develop them with your API in mind. So we use a fire and forget approach when making asynchronous requests isn't possible. If the language supports it we even use queued and background jobs to push logs to us. All in an effort to literally reduce any impact on your API and make sure it's running 24/7. Even if our processing pipeline and/or our website are completely broken down, not working, kaput we will STILL be receiving logs from your API requests and as soon as we are back up we will process those logs and you'll see them. The second part hasn't yet happened, and we'll make sure it doesn't but just in case you were wondering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you're probably wondering about the cost of this near to infinite scale on AWS. I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cindreta/status/1473744091242545153"&gt;recently tweeted this screenshot&lt;/a&gt; from our Laravel Vapor dashboard. &lt;strong&gt;On it you can see that we processed over 7M queued jobs and handled over 1.3 million HTTP requests in the past 30 days.&lt;/strong&gt; On top of that you can see that the average queue duration is 500ms 🤯 You can also see that we ONLY paid 65 USD to handle all of that and around 100 USD more for the RDS database and AWS S3 fees. &lt;strong&gt;So we're able to run our entire stack for less than 200 USD per month at this scale&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been running on this architecture for the past 6 months without any down time and we keep doubling the amount of API requests we process every month. I haven't spent one single night thinking about our infrastructure. It simply just works. &lt;strong&gt;It works because I've spent half a year trying to isolate myself, our code base, and our future employees from the entire process.&lt;/strong&gt; At its essence it's such a simple and pure idea of running completely on the AWS infrastructure, controlled by a countless army of DevOps pros that Jeff pays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'd like to ask for a &lt;strong&gt;round of applause&lt;/strong&gt; 👏 for all the &lt;strong&gt;DevOps teams working at AWS&lt;/strong&gt; that have actually made Treblle possible. Making sure the Lambda functions scale, making sure S3 scales, making sure API Gateway scales...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of you have asked me how we scale, how am I not worried, how we can process as much data. Now you know. It's a symphony of multiple serverless processes that are as scalable as Amazon is. Will we stop there - no we won't : ) There is more room to improve and I'll share some more insights on what we are doing on top of all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the read, I hope it can help you scale something you are working on but above all I hope it puts a little bit of more trust into Treblle as a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always you can follow me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cindreta"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, add me on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedrancindric/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; or read more blog posts on our &lt;a href="https://treblle.com/blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRUD Operation</title>
      <author>Md Nazmul Islam</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 13:55:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devnazmul/crud-operation-3k6e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devnazmul/crud-operation-3k6e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;MongoDB is a document-oriented database program widely classified as a NoSQL database program.&lt;br&gt;
In MongoDB, the CRUD operation refers to the creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents. Here is an explanation of the operations in detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Create (or insert) operations add new documents to a collection. There are two ways to add new documents to a collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;db.collection.insertOne()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;db.collection.insertMany()
insertOne() operation allows us to create individual documents in a collection, while the insertMany() operation is used to create multiple documents in a single operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is an example of how we can add a single car to the cars collection using the insertOne() operation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.cars.insertOne(
//inserting Bugatti Veyron Mansory Vivere-2005 into cars collection
    {
       name: "Bugatti Veyron Mansory Vivere"
       model: "2005"
    }
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now we will see how we can add info of multiple cars to the cars collection with a single operation using insertMany().&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.cars.insertMany([{
//inserting three cars along with their models into cars collection
       name: "Bugatti Veyron Mansory Vivere"
       model: "2005"
},{
       name: "Aston Martin AM-RB 001"
       model: "2018"
},{
       name: "Ferrari Pininfarina Sergio"
       model: "2013"
}])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Read operations retrieve documents from a collection. Here is the method in Mongodb to retrieve information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;db.collection.find()&lt;br&gt;
find() operation will return everything from a collection if you call it without any parameters. On the other hand, we can specify any filter or criteria to retrieve information from a collection using:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;db.collection.find(query)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is an example of how we can read information about all cars from the cars collection:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;db.cars.find() // no parameters&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ "_id" : ObjectId("1"), "name" : "Bugatti Veyron Mansory Vivere", "model" : "2005" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("2"), "name" : "Aston Martin AM-RB 001", "model" : "2018" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("3"), "name" : "Ferrari Pininfarina Sergio", "2013" : "2005" }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update operations modify existing documents in a collection. There are three ways to update documents of a collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;db.collection.updateOne()&lt;br&gt;
– Updates one field in the document where the given criteria or filter meets the condition. Updating a field will not remove the old field instead a new field will be added to the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;db.collection.updateMany()&lt;br&gt;
– Updates all fields in the document where the given criteria or filter meets the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;db.collection.replaceOne()&lt;br&gt;
– Replace the entire document. It will replace the old fields and values with new ones.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; if we have the following document:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
   "_id" : ObjectId("1"),
   "model" : 2005
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;replaceOne({"_id" : ObjectId("1")}, { "new_model" : 2020})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;will result in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
   "_id" : ObjectId("1"),
   "new_model" : 2020
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While using:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;updateOne({"_id" : ObjectId("1")}, {$set: { "new_model" : 2020}})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Will result in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
   "_id" : ObjectId("1"),
   "model" : 2005,
   "new_model" : 2020
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While using:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;updateMany({"_id" : ObjectId("1")}, {$set: { "name" : "NewName"}, $set: { "new_model" : 2020}})&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;will result in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
   "_id" : ObjectId("1"),
   "model" : 2005,
   "new_model" : 2020
   "name" : "newName"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Delete operations delete documents from a collection. There are two methods to delete documents of a collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;db.collection.deleteOne()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;db.collection.deleteMany()
deleteOne() method removes only the first document matched by the query filter document, and deleteMany() deletes multiple objects at once.
&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:&lt;/strong&gt;
Here is an example of how we can remove only one car having the model “2013” from the cars collection:
&lt;code&gt;db.cars.deleteOne(
//deletes one car having model "2013"
{ "model": "2013" }
)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt;
Here is an example of how all cars, having the model “2013” - can be deleted from the cars collection:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;db.cars.deleteMany(
//delete all cars having model "2013"
    { "model": "2013" }
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Learn AWS as a Frontend Developer</title>
      <author>Ali Raza</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 13:45:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aliraza/learn-aws-as-a-frontend-developer-2j7c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aliraza/learn-aws-as-a-frontend-developer-2j7c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services — AWS, the leading cloud-computing platform, is historically being associated with backend technologies such as DevOps, API development, Databases, etc. This is true, given that AWS and other cloud platforms are mentioned randomly in the jobs for backend developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you can learn relevant AWS technologies for your web apps. Most of those are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-aws-amplify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. AWS Amplify&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H6R4R6nK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pmyrnrhqhp8349nw8zy2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H6R4R6nK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pmyrnrhqhp8349nw8zy2.png" alt="Source: GitHub.com" width="880" height="125"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that enables frontend web and mobile developers to quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS. Amplify provides two services: Amplify Hosting and Amplify Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Hosting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a. AWS Amplify hosting provides a git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web apps with continuous deployment.&lt;br&gt;
b. Amplify supports the common SPA frameworks, for example, React, Angular, Vue.js, Ionic, and Ember, as well as static site generators like Gatsby.&lt;br&gt;
c. Manage production and staging environments for your frontend and backend by connecting new branches.&lt;br&gt;
d. Set up rewrites and redirects to maintain SEO rankings and route traffic based on your client app requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Amplify Studio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. The Studio is a visual development environment that simplifies the creation of scalable, full-stack web and mobile apps.&lt;br&gt;
b. Set up authentication for your app.&lt;br&gt;
c. Powerful and easy-to-understand authorization.&lt;br&gt;
d. Infrastructure-as-code configures all backend capabilities with AWS CloudFormation.&lt;br&gt;
e. Use Studio’s visual designer to build frontend UI components. Choose from dozens of designs in the pre-built UI component library.&lt;br&gt;
f. Import Figma prototypes built by designers into Studio as React code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-aws-appsync"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. AWS AppSync
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync is a service to create GraphQL based APIs for interaction between multiple data sources such as AWS DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dTGI7tn0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g1ghzvrjezf9ygyro3b6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dTGI7tn0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g1ghzvrjezf9ygyro3b6.png" alt="Source: GitHub.com" width="880" height="264"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
source: AWS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of its features are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Real-time, collaborative mobile, and web apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync lets you build collaborative apps with shared data that is updated in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Offline data sync support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For mobile and web apps, AppSync provides local data access when devices go offline, and data synchronization with &lt;br&gt;
customizable conflict resolution, when they are back online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Integrating data from multiple sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync allows access data in Amazon DynamoDB, triggers AWS Lambda functions, or runs Amazon OpenSearch queries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Data collision detection and conflict resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS AppSync can automatically resolve conflicts on data that is shared between multiple users and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Secure data access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon AppSync integrates with Amazon Cognito and AWS Identity and Access Management, so you can set fine-grained permissions on GraphQL operations and keep users and app data secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-amazon-device-farm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Amazon Device Farm
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Device Farm provides an extensive range of desktop browsers and mobile devices to test web and mobile applications. It creates videos and logs to help identify issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Automated testing in parallel on multiple devices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2ERfRu-8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k685u3ykaqtjhr51fj7v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2ERfRu-8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k685u3ykaqtjhr51fj7v.png" alt="Source: GitHub.com" width="880" height="294"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  4. Amazon Location Service
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location service provides maps, trackers, route calculators, and more services. All queries are anonymous and user data is not passed. Esri and HERE services are used for routes, tracking, and geofencing.&lt;/p&gt;

  5. AWS CodeCommit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have been using GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab for hosting your codebase, however, AWS CodeCommit is also another solution for your scalable private repos. It is highly available, secure, fully managed, and can store anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-aws-xray"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. AWS X-Ray
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components. It helps developers with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Review request behavior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Discover application issues and improve application performance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. Designed for a variety of applications&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Useful JavaScript Code Snippets for Common Problems 😎</title>
      <author>Tabassum Khanum</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/codewithtee/useful-javascript-code-snippets-for-common-problems-2lpc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Coders!&lt;br&gt;
JavaScript is one of the widely used languages in Web Development.  A broad and vital ecosystem has evolved around JS, offering tons and tons of frameworks and libraries that help you develop applications faster. At the same time, it made our coding experience a little complicated. Sometimes it’s good to take a step back and try to understand how to do things without a library. In this article, we will be going through some JS snippets which will provide a little help with those repetitive, simple tasks that come up each day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-sort-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Sort an array
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//strings
const names = ["Seema", "Rekha", "Jaya"];
names.sort();
//['Jaya', 'Rekha', 'Seema' ]

//Numbers
const numbers = [101, 8, 87];
numbers.sort((a, b) =&amp;gt; {
  return a - b;
});
//[ 8, 87, 101 ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-select-a-random-element"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2.  Select a random element
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const items = ["Ball", "Bat", "Cup"]
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)
items[randomIndex]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-reverse-a-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Reverse a string
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function reverseString(string) {
       return string.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
}

revereseString("Random String")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-check-if-element-has-a-class"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Check if element has a class
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const element = document.querySelector("#element")
element.classList.contains("active")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-string-interpolation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. String interpolation
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const name = "Jaya"
console.log(`Hi, ${name}. You have ${2 ** 3} new notifications.`}
//Hi, Jaya. You have 8 new notifications.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-loop-through-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Loop through an array
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cars = ["Ford", "BMW", "Audi" ]
for (let car of cars) {
      console.log(car)
}

/*
Ford
BMW
Audi
*/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-get-current-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7.  Get current time
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const date = new Date()
const currentTime = 
   `${date.getHours()}:${date.getMintues()}:${date.getSeconds()}`

console.log(currentTimes)
//example output: "22:16:41"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-replace-part-of-a-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Replace part of a string
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const string = "You are awesome."
const replacedString = string.replace("You", "We")

console.log(replacedString) //Output: "We are awesome"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-destructing-variable-assignment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9.  Destructing variable assignment
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let profile = ['bob', 34, 'carpenter'];
let [name, age, job] = profile;
console.log(name);
// bob
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-using-the-spread-operator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Using the spread operator
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;let data = [1,2,3,4,5];
console.log(...data);
//  1 2 3 4 5
let data2 = [6,7,8,9,10];
let combined = [...data, ...data2];
console.log(...combined);
// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
console.log(Math.max(...combined));
// 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-return-number-maximum-elements-from-an-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  11.  Return [Number] Maximum Elements From an Array
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const maxElement = ( array, number = 1 ) =&amp;gt; [...array].sort(( x,y ) =&amp;gt; y - x).slice(0, number);

//Example 
maxElement ([ 1,2,3,4,5]);  // [5]
maxElement([ 6, 7, 8, 9 , 10, 10] , 2);   // [10,10]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A cleaner way to compose the sx prop (Material UI v5)</title>
      <author>Rohan Salunke</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 13:03:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/okrohan/a-cleaner-way-to-compose-the-sx-prop-material-ui-v5-4ko7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/okrohan/a-cleaner-way-to-compose-the-sx-prop-material-ui-v5-4ko7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Material UI v5 recently released their new design system &lt;a href="https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/"&gt;the Sx prop&lt;/a&gt;. The property includes style properties from CSS and @mui/system. Taking the MUI styling system to the next level. Personally I loved the new style engine from Material UI v5, enabling me to build Web Apps totally using the Material UI's ecosystem. Being used to the clean method of composing CSS classes using &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames"&gt;classnames&lt;/a&gt; package, I found composing and conditionally chaing the &lt;code&gt;sx&lt;/code&gt; props a bit unclean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-feature"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Feature
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're totally new to mui v5, Let's first look at what exactly is sx props. &lt;code&gt;sx&lt;/code&gt; prop is prop used in MuiV5 design system, that leverages mui shorthands and native css properties to provide a good styling experience. Below is a basic example of its usage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@mui/material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;mui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Passing Sx Prop Here&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;mt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/basic-sx-u23oj"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen, sx prop is a JS object comprising of sx properties i.e mui short hands and native css props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a JS object, using the sx prop across the markdown might look unclean. There might be usecases where you'd want to reuse some styling or apply conditionally styling.&lt;br&gt;
Lets look at another example where in you need to conditionally color an element based on React state, also enforce modular styling pattern to ensure better reusability.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@mui/material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@mui/material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBordered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxNight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Follow are applied unconditionally&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBordered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;...(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxNight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;...(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Follow sx applied when isDay === false&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;contained&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/mui-sx-ps-pokns"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in the sandbox, one might need lots of spread operators &lt;code&gt;(...)&lt;/code&gt; and ternary conditions to implement composition of the sx prop. If you have worked on huge projects with modular css patterns, scaling above might get ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-sx"&gt;mui-sx&lt;/a&gt; comes to rescue. Its a tiny JS library based off &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames"&gt;classnames&lt;/a&gt;, that helps elegantly compse the sx prop. Let's look at the above example written using &lt;code&gt;mui-sx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;mui-sx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@mui/material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@mui/material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBordered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxNight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Stack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spacing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Follow are applied unconditionally&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sxBordered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Follow sx applied when isDay === true&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toggle&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/sx-compose-example-z0mki"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Cleaner! The syntax is very close to &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames"&gt;classnames&lt;/a&gt; and if you are someone that has been using &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames"&gt;classnames&lt;/a&gt; for a while then you might enjoy using &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-sx"&gt;mui-sx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to the NPM Package: &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mui-sx"&gt;mui-sx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/olabib/advanced-ios-development-build-phases-part-1-igk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever come across this build error in Xcode..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--siwbMJA6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5j5k09zer9bu4tlu9hyb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--siwbMJA6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5j5k09zer9bu4tlu9hyb.png" alt="Xcode build phase failure" width="702" height="120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm sure you have.&lt;br&gt;
During my first years of iOS development, this has been one of the most ambiauious errors for me, I can only see that I've messed up somewhere in the codebase and I have to go and see what I've done wrong, however, after I got to know build phases better in Xcode this couldn't make more sense..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-phases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build Phases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Xcode build phases section is the scope where Xcode offers you the possibility to run custom scripts &lt;em&gt;- known as run scripts -&lt;/em&gt; as part of the build process, these script can be tailored for any behavior you can think of. The cool thing though is that you can control the build process through this powerful script of you..&lt;br&gt;
Let's better have an example..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Starter, How can we add those run scripts? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ToFZJWIv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e1fjxulghozxue8lhrfa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ToFZJWIv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e1fjxulghozxue8lhrfa.png" alt="Xcode build phase" width="880" height="620"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head to you project file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose your app target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate the build phases tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the + button and choose &lt;code&gt;New Run Script Phase&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will add a run script template for you..&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sKcP5VRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ffv0pyu9jzb5nj56h2hw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sKcP5VRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ffv0pyu9jzb5nj56h2hw.png" alt="Xcode Run Script" width="880" height="845"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can give a cool name to your script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the path you shell on your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Shell script that will be run during the building process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All these run scripts will run serially, and you can change the order by grabbing the run script and moving it up or down.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
For our very first run script, we will be doing something very simple..&lt;br&gt;
Just printing some message to the user..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YBPmERmf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eou2x9ueij5gdtvkqh0z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YBPmERmf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eou2x9ueij5gdtvkqh0z.png" alt="Xcode build phase" width="880" height="347"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This message however won't be printed to the log. Instead, you can access it through the build report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--olNrv79p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fzrm5zuhifzyjgk78pjq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--olNrv79p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fzrm5zuhifzyjgk78pjq.png" alt="Xcode Build Report" width="880" height="665"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the report navigator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose your build of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose all messages tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will find the message printed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's tweak this build a little, let's break the build for no reason..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rNW6JPIr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ba3ucmg4icy9853s7aci.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rNW6JPIr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ba3ucmg4icy9853s7aci.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="198"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The key here is to exit the script with any value rather than zero, this will indeed fail the script and all the succeeding run scripts won't even run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in our friendly message we now understand its meaning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dNHFShiN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uxr5f2lc4zm5d2u15a7m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dNHFShiN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uxr5f2lc4zm5d2u15a7m.png" alt="Xcode Build Phase" width="846" height="76"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is it for our first part, in the next part we will build upon our knowledge and develop a very useful run script to use in you apps, so stay tuned 😉&lt;/p&gt;
