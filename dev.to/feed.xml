      <description>&lt;p&gt;Women empowerment has always been something that I’m passionate about. Being surrounded by a community that helped me grow to become the reliable and strong developer I am today is something that I am truly grateful for and I wish the same for every woman out there! To find the support system to help her grow and become someone extraordinary and remarkable in what she does.&lt;br&gt;
In the light of International Women’s Day, I decided to highlight some of the key factors in empowering women (and everyone) everywhere from my own perspective and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mentorship" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mentorship
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A8xH3wou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zfr6gi5wsqqbdltouwwg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A8xH3wou--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zfr6gi5wsqqbdltouwwg.jpg" alt="bonneval-sebastien-lG-6_ox_UXE-unsplash"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important parts of my life is getting my first mentor when I was a sophomore, it helped shape the path I took in my career afterward and I’m really grateful for my first mentorship experience and for our conversations on leadership and how to improve my social skills. It really opened my eyes to focus on my goals in life and how to achieve them.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, I did not only focus on my technical skills but I also worked on my soft skills, so I took speech classes to boost my confidence and writing classes to improve my communication skills in addition to participating in extracurricular activities. All of these, and more, helped me shape who I am as a person today. After all, leadership and soft skills are essential in a developer’s career, and as a woman, they helped me pave the path of my career journey.&lt;br&gt;
So I would like to highlight the importance of mentorship, whether you were a student, newly grad, or a professional, mentorship is essential to your career! Grow your connections, find the right mentor for you, and get started with your mentorship journey! You will be surprised with how much you can gain through mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tackling-imposter-syndrome" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tackling Imposter Syndrome
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imposter Syndrome has always been a challenge that both women and men deal with. Feeling like a fraud and dealing with those negative thoughts on a daily basis while doing any task can be really challenging. Imposter syndrome will always be an issue that we will deal with as it’s something that’s coming from within and we have to fight these doubts! And that’s why it is important to spread awareness of Imposter Syndrome and always remind ourselves that “I’m strong, I’m enough”.&lt;br&gt;
Imposter syndrome can be born from several factors related to personality traits like anxiety or perfectionism or could be related to behavioral courses affected by the surrounding environment.&lt;br&gt;
There are several ways you could tackle imposter syndrome, and I’m not an expert, but there were some practices that helped me stand strong against it, like talking to a mentor or someone I know about it, organizing my thoughts, and reminding myself that I’m doing fine and that no one’s perfect, having a reasonable list of tasks to achieve on daily/weekly basis, and finally taking a moment to reflect on myself, my achievements and giving myself pep talks so often to encourage myself.&lt;br&gt;
Now.. take a moment to reflect on your own achievements and how far you have gone from a personal or professional point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#growth" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Growth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have mentioned imposter syndrome, it is essential to bring up growth. Each person grows at their own pace and this year I learned how to grow.. patiently. Patience is essential to growth and it is okay if we take our time growing. One time I was listening to an episode of the TED Radio Hour podcast titled “It Takes Time” and I loved it! and I have been thinking of it almost every day! It reminded me that some things do not need to be rushed to reach their full potential.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8cHvKIH0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6i484cisu3z6d0jgnw6z.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8cHvKIH0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6i484cisu3z6d0jgnw6z.jpg" alt="hello-i-m-nik-AsRAyHIkOHk-unsplashff"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
One of my favorite parts was when they talked about sloths! (my favorite animal) and it changed my perspective a whole lot! We always perceived sloths as lazy, but in fact, they are not.. They are just taking their time doing things their own way and I think that’s amazing!&lt;br&gt;
Sloths might be slow, but they are built differently (in fact, they are strong), which allows them to stay hanging on trees the entire day or pull heavy items (an adult sloth can be 3x stronger than a human).&lt;br&gt;
Sloths are built differently, so we cannot really say that they are slow because they don’t meet our usual pace (or expectations) as humans. I could write many facts about sloths but then it would be a long list of facts. So I hope that my thoughts on growth gave you a new perspective on the topic (and sloths).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3YzvGwvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/we3a6ifbe6zxzse573la.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3YzvGwvm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/we3a6ifbe6zxzse573la.jpg" alt="william-phipps-l4QSO66AwmE-unsplash (1)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Essentially, community, mentorship, and allyship are all part of growing as a person. And so I would like to encourage you to take on the opportunity to be part of a community whether as a mentee or a mentor.&lt;br&gt;
Allow yourself to challenge and be challenged, but always remember to pace yourself and grow patiently. And with that being said, I would like to give some room for the question “How can I grow? How will I grow patiently”&lt;br&gt;
Happy International Women’s Day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SheCoded: A year of silence and reflection</title>
      <author>Sylwia Vargas</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 00:20:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sylwiavargas/shecoded-a-year-of-silence-and-reflection-2c15</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sylwiavargas/shecoded-a-year-of-silence-and-reflection-2c15</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://dev.to/sylwiavargas/nevertheless-sylwia-vargas-coded-4fn"&gt;I participated in the #shecoded campaign&lt;/a&gt; last year, I did not want to recount my story in a fashion of a heroic journey. I took that space to reflect on what my personal perseverance toolkit included. I liked that format because it allowed me to create new rules of the game. They were straightforward: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actively oppose injustice,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stand up for yourself and for others,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn to brag about your achievements,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't overapologize,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain work-life balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I thought about these points as simply a process for "debugging" impostor syndrome out of my head and sexism out of my direct environment. I did not know how much impact these intentions would have on me in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr this post got lengthy so long story short, I found three sources of energy&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#building-assertiveness"&gt;boundary work&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#nurturing-fluffiness"&gt;kind and fluffy folks and communities&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#being-silent"&gt;silence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-assertiveness" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building assertiveness
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I had a pleasure to participate in a workshop by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mckensiemack"&gt;McKensie Mack&lt;/a&gt; on boundaries where they laid out how we should be investing emotionally in people and not companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Be transformational with people and transactional with institutions"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/desireeadaway"&gt;Desiree Adaway&lt;/a&gt; on boundary work&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stating my boundaries, giving feedback, talking about my achievements, communicating obstacles, negotiating terms and even being unapologetic about my eight hours of sleep every night has become much easier. I have always come across as direct and assertive but inside, any of these situations would take a heavy toll on me and result in a burning feeling of guilt afterwards. Now I feel okay before, during and after majority of difficult conversations and tough moments. I wouldn't say I no longer have any feelings about them but &lt;strong&gt;I am much more confident because I know what I expect from a workplace, a community, a job, a colleague and from myself.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that, I was able to just recently tell my most wonderful manager that I wanted to change jobs, not be sneaky about it and not surprise her with a sudden resignation notice. I don't think I would have been so comfortable with such a conversation a year ago, and of course the fact that this conversation happened was also in part of what an amazing manager she is. But, I was really proud of how that went and how I carried myself through the subsequent job search. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nurturing-fluffiness" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nurturing fluffiness
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that just as much as sexism and tech-bro energy drain me, fluffiness, kindness and honesty make me feel grounded, safe and courageous. A year ago, the stressful stuff would consume a lot of my energy during and after work and I felt like I was shrinking inside myself just to get by. This is a very sad and pitiful way to be. I realized that by letting this stuff get to me, I was giving it much more power that it deserved and instead, I decided to nurture little pockets of fluffiness and kindness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for instance, I doubled down on supporting kind practices in the cohorts I lead and on creating more moments when folks could genuinely connect with each other. I started &lt;a href="https://buttondown.email/sylwia"&gt;a newsletter for kind folks in tech&lt;/a&gt; to build a community nurturing kindness in tech. I co-created a feminist tech collective that offers free dev support to NGOs and has been run in a non-hierarchical collaborative manner. And finally, I realized that I am the happiest when I write Ruby, Ruby on Rails (or React for the same reasons), which I elaborated on in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/sylwiavargas/why-do-you-love-ruby-actually-an-ode-5e7n"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined tech, I was mostly exposed to competitive, patriarchal and toxic cultures and I tried to get by. That doesn't mean that I'd shy away from giving feedback or trying to debug/fight/feedback what was broken but just that the energy it took from me would leave me emotionally deflated. I would find myself in a constant defensive state and that's not a feeling you want to sustain. &lt;strong&gt;I remembered my friend once telling me that choosing to not response is also a way to resist toxicity because of the emotional labor otherwise required.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon I rejected that fight mode, I would react from the place of empathy and kindness and see that these issues no longer felt personal and I had more energy to engage folks in conversations on problematic behaviors. &lt;strong&gt;I also noticed that if there are a few fluffy folks in a cohort or a team, the bullies just don't have space to be obnoxious.&lt;/strong&gt; These two findings are something I will think more about in the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#being-silent" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Being silent
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that I was brought up in a way that I always feel pressure to lead the conversation, to entertain and to just fill up the space with words. If there was silence after a question during the meeting, I had to answer just to not make it awkward for the person who runs the meeting. Or, that if something is wrong, I should speak up. This past year, I have been rethinking my relationship to words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I can be very talkative and I genuinely love getting to know people on a deeper level, talking for the sake of filling the silence drains me and stresses me out. I can't do small talk. Culturally I have not been equipped to deal with shallow exchanges. Ask me how I am and I will tell you about the disturbing thing I read, about the pain in my back because I slept in a funny way or about how the anxiety creeps up on me when I think about the pandemic and my grandma. For the longest time I felt inadequate to function in an American corporate setting. That is until I realized that I can just be my straightforward self and not do the small talk. It actually has been much simpler than I anticipated. I just don't. And people mostly don't see to make much of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I don't have to (and shouldn't) be always the one person who answers a question. &lt;strong&gt;Silence is great for the team — we need time to process the question or to "rehearse" the answer before we speak&lt;/strong&gt; (if you've ever dealt with impostor syndrome, you know what I mean). &lt;strong&gt;Silence gives us time to get ready to participate. It gives space for the marginalized folks to join in.&lt;/strong&gt; So, while I still think that women should be heard in meetings, I don't assume that I need to always be the first one to voice my opinion because I am comfortable with being the extrovert in meetings and I am a white woman. This new approach helped me run my lessons better and introduced more calm in how I lead and take part in meetings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there are many ways to speak out and act against injustice. I learned that I work better with allies in helping them find ways to be active than confronting toxic folks myself about sexism. I would give feedback but I no longer try to call out every sexist joke in real-time. That being said, I now allocate this energy mostly to being an ally and speaking out against other forms of toxicity and injustice. Most importantly, I'm calm about it and no longer lose sleep.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As horrible as these past 12 months have been health-wise and family-wise for me, they have been tremendous for building up silent strength for when the world gets better. Meanwhile, I'm grateful to everyone who has been on this journey with me, even if they were an internet kind stranger. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learn about difference between Type &amp; Interface in Typescript</title>
      <author>CodeOzz</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 23:15:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/codeozz/learn-about-difference-between-type-interface-in-typescript-1nif</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/codeozz/learn-about-difference-between-type-interface-in-typescript-1nif</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using typescript, you might use interface &amp;amp; type but if I ask you the difference between them, are you able to answer it ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this article, you will be able to answer it during any discussion or interview !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#type" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Type
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic, it allow us to create a new type !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interface" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interface
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrary to &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; is restricted to an object type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the news release, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; are similar but there some differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#similitude" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Similitude
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#object-typing" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Object typing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can define the shape of an object with both, but the syntax is not the same&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with interface:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with type:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extend" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extend
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both can be extended, and the difference is ... yes the syntax again !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with interface:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with type:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-difference" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The difference
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-type-can-do-and-what-interface-cant-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What type can do, and what interface cant do
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; can be used for creating new type with union, tuples or can be used to defined primitive type !&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DataTuple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// tuple typing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-interface-can-do-and-what-type-cant-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What interface can do, and what type cant do
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; can &lt;code&gt;implement&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interface can be merged in a single &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; if there are defined multiple times&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kr"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Toto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt; are very similar but each other have his own dedicated feature !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally use interface when I need to type object structure, and I use type when I need to create type from primitive type or when I want to combine other types in one type !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nevertheless, Jesse Coded </title>
      <author>Jesse Smith Byers</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 21:44:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jessesbyers/nevertheless-jesse-coded-3hh7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jessesbyers/nevertheless-jesse-coded-3hh7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My story: I'm a 42 year old mother of two boys, and I started my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jessesbyers/the-beginning-why-code-1n1d"&gt;career change from K-12 public education into software&lt;/a&gt; at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, when I was one month away from graduating from a full-time immersive bootcamp, my kids' school shut down for the rest of the year. I started squeezing what should have been 8-10 hours of coding into the 5am-9am 4-hour time block each day, so I could start home-schooling at 9am. Nevertheless, I graduated on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post-bootcamp job search looked a lot different for me than for my non-parent classmates, and I &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jessesbyers/balancing-covid-19-homeschooling-and-post-bootcamp-goals-5ghc"&gt;reflected on the struggles and came up with a system that worked for me&lt;/a&gt; at that time. I kept myself accountable through my (almost) weekly DEV posts. Until my son knocked over a full mug of coffee on my laptop. Nevertheless, I figured out a way to make it all work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that "making it work" means constantly revisiting your goals, and constantly re-calibrating what is feasible and desirable in any given time period. I adjusted my post-bootcamp career goals, and ended up combining my past experience in education with code to start working in software education. Because of the pandemic, I started working full-time with two boys at home. Nevertheless, it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was conflicted about this decision, and struggled with thoughts that I had somehow failed or given up by not ending this story with a title of "software engineer". Periodic reflection helps me realize that the "recipe" for career changing into tech has to be different for everyone, and DEV has been a great platform to foster my reflection about &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jessesbyers/reflecting-on-a-year-of-code-4bpa"&gt;how I'm progressing in the field&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, I still need reminders to keep reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I work full-time in software ed, while freelancing part-time on educational software (in my non-existent free time). This gives me balance and fulfillment. And I realize how lucky I am to be able to juggle these roles, thanks to a supportive husband who has been doing our cooking, and moving to a new town where the kids have been attending in-person school 5 days a week since September. This has not been true for all of us this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless. Despite the ups and downs and in and outs of my journey, I am now a software engineer AND I am an advocate for increasing access for more underrepresented folks in tech. This is actually the main part of my job description, and in the end, I am very proud of this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-advice-for-allies-to-support-underrepresented-folks-who-code-is" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My advice for allies to support underrepresented folks who code is...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned over the past year, as a bootcamp student, and now as a bootcamp employee, that one of the biggest keys to supporting underrepresented folks is flexibility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We need flexible schedules so learning can happen at the times that work for us.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We need flexible structures that allow us to set our own goals and check them off, and revise them as needed, as we continuously juggle code and life.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need flexible definitions of what success looks like, including the various roles that might be the best fit for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy International Women's Day, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I'm Sam Jarman 👨🏼‍💻, and I support women devs in 2021!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Sam Jarman, and I imagine like a lot of men of tech, I'm also on a journey to correct my own biases (subconscious or not) and do my bit to get us towards a gender-equal world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For IWD I want to highlight one of the projects I did in the past - Dev Chats. I'm proud that my written interview series is about 50/50 women and features people of colour and people from the LBGQTIA+ community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below I want to highlight some of my favourites for you to read. Starting off with Hannah, who was so kind to write me pretty much a college essay per question, through to Kristina who has had an impressive journey into the security field. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Congrats to the "Hack the Planet" Contest Winners!</title>
      <author>Jess Lee (she/her)</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 19:53:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devteam/congrats-to-the-hack-the-planet-contest-winners-2a63</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devteam/congrats-to-the-hack-the-planet-contest-winners-2a63</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm so excited to introduce you all to the winners and winning projects of the New Relic x DEV &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-new-relic-hack-the-planet-contest-on-dev-5d"&gt;Hack the Planet&lt;/a&gt; contest! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to submit their projects on The Relicans (a new community created and moderated by New Relic, dedicated to software developers and the topics that interest them). Because of this, New Relic has announced the winners on The Relicans today ⭐️ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#head-over-to-this-post-on-the-relicans-to-find-out-if-your-project-was-given-a-grand-prize-or-runnerup-award-big-congrats-to-the-winners" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Head over to this post on &lt;a href="https://www.therelicans.com/therelicans/hack-the-planet-contest-winners-announced-22po"&gt;The Relicans&lt;/a&gt; to find out if your project was given a Grand Prize or Runner-Up award. BIG congrats to the winners.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who submitted a project for this hackathon, please pat yourselves on the back. You've created an app dedicated to saving the planet and we were able to plant a  bunch of trees in the process. It's efforts like these that help us all see the larger value of software development in the world we live in ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's stop using [a-zA-Z]+</title>
      <author>Till Sanders</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 19:27:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tillsanders/let-s-stop-using-a-za-z-4a0m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tillsanders/let-s-stop-using-a-za-z-4a0m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you, like me, regularly (see what I did here?) validate alphanumeric fields using Regex, you probably learned to do it like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Till&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;a-zA-Z0-9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+/gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is technically correct, of course. And it's what most validation libraries will do when you tell them a field is &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;alphanumeric&lt;/code&gt; / etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have a problem with this approach and a lot (!) of other people do, too. Because I'm from Germany. More specifically, from a town called Lüdenscheid. And Lüdenscheid won't match the regular expression above because of the Umlaut. Same applies for languages like French, Spanish, Czech, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can we as developers be more inclusive towards languages other than English? Do we have to include all possible variations of the latin alphabet? That's a common suggestion, but of course, it doesn't scale well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#luckily-unicode-has-us-covered" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Luckily, Unicode has us covered:
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lüdenscheid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Letter}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Mark}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+/gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;\p&lt;/code&gt; flag allows us to pick a so called &lt;a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html#category"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unicode Character Category&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In Unicode, all characters are sorted into categories that we can use in our regular expression. The &lt;code&gt;Letter&lt;/code&gt; category includes letters from all kinds of languages, not just A-Z. But it does not include, e.g. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; which is important for security. The &lt;code&gt;Mark&lt;/code&gt; category – as &lt;a href="https://dev.to/lionelrowe"&gt;lionelrowe&lt;/a&gt; pointed out in the comments (thanks) – contains combining marks. In Unicode, a letter like &lt;code&gt;ü&lt;/code&gt; can be either one or two combined code points. So depending on how the character is coded, we need the &lt;code&gt;Mark&lt;/code&gt; category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-details-on-the-mark-category" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More details on the Mark category
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we omit the &lt;code&gt;Mark&lt;/code&gt; category and run the following Regex: &lt;code&gt;'Lüdenscheid'.match(/[\p{Letter}]+/gu)&lt;/code&gt; it will match &lt;code&gt;Lüdenscheid&lt;/code&gt;, if the &lt;code&gt;ü&lt;/code&gt; is encoded as a single character. On the other hand, if the &lt;code&gt;ü&lt;/code&gt; is encoded as a letter-mark-combination (&lt;code&gt;u +   ̈&lt;/code&gt;), the regex will only match &lt;code&gt;Lu&lt;/code&gt;, because it will stop at the &lt;code&gt;̈&lt;/code&gt; mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#browser-support" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Browser support
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_property_escapes"&gt;Browser support&lt;/a&gt; for this feature is good, IE (not Edge) being the only exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Match only letters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lüdenscheid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Letter}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Mark}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+/gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Match letters and spaces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Pražští filharmonici&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Letter}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Mark}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+/gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Match letters and hyphens&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Île-de-France&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Letter}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Mark}-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+/gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Match letters hyphens and spaces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Île-de-France&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;[\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Letter}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;{Mark}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;+/gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>4 Steps to Debug Any Problem</title>
      <author>Michael Chrupcala</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/mikechrupcala/4-steps-to-debug-any-problem-3565</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your leg started to cramp ten minutes ago, but you barely noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chatter from a distant TV is nothing but background noise...white noise, a gentle reminder of the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your only focus is the sound from the strokes of your keyboard…click click click…a rapid-fire staccato of instructions to your machine...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create Object&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;em&gt;insert method&lt;/em&gt;…then suddenly, the moment of truth when you test the lines you’ve just added……Success! Great, now you just have to add that &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; last function…broken! What!! Which line???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing code isn't easy, no matter how much experience you have with it.&lt;/strong&gt; When you get something wrong, some errors are more helpful than others at pointing you toward the mistake. Usually it just takes one obvious re-write to get your program back up-and-running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what happens when you’re stuck?&lt;/strong&gt; Completely at a loss, and staring at 200+lines of computer-speak that seemed very familiar to you just a second ago, and very &lt;em&gt;unfamiliar&lt;/em&gt; in an instant. How do you work your way out of the problem? &lt;strong&gt;Try these steps to debug your code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-0-check-for-grammarspelling-mistakes" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 0: Check for Grammar/Spelling Mistakes
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious? Sure, but I’ve noticed that 98% of my mistakes come from a misplaced comma or a misspelled “this”. Code is a fickle, unforgiving tool, and one extra letter or missing syntax can confuse your compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Pictured below: me, for 2 hours, trying to find the extra “.” in my code)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/guSDEekNFb23C/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/guSDEekNFb23C/giphy.gif" alt="A very confused man looking franticly around"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, most IDE’s will come with features to help you catch errors faster. Personally I love all of the following features: &lt;strong&gt;auto-complete&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;error detection&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;color-coding&lt;/strong&gt;. That last one’s my favorite because it means I can skim through a bunch of orange text strings and notice that little red stinker with the missing quotation mark. But if that didn’t work, ask yourself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-what-do-you-know" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1: What do you know?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can feel really frustrating when your confidence is dashed by a bright red ‘ERROR’ across the screen. But you knew enough to get yourself here, and that means you probably know enough to get yourself out! So first, you should pick apart the error message and take a mental note of what’s familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Syntax error&lt;/strong&gt;…I’ve seen this before, and the last time it was just a typo.”&lt;br&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;Null value&lt;/strong&gt;….well I know that means that some value is either undefined or it doesn’t exist. Oh, and I also know that the value is probably considered ‘false’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you can try is, if you added more than a few lines of code, then you can isolate them and read slowly line-by-line. Explain to yourself what &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the lines should be doing, or read every word and remind yourself of the definitions. Maybe you forgot the “OR” operator, or you wrote &lt;strong&gt;splice()&lt;/strong&gt; when you needed &lt;strong&gt;slice()&lt;/strong&gt;. Which leads me to the next step…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-what-are-you-missing" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2: What are you missing?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it could be really helpful to make a list of what you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EpcLl2zo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4fvjkh4tvtbhueyhcmkp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EpcLl2zo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4fvjkh4tvtbhueyhcmkp.jpg" alt="Notebook on a wooden desk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have an idea of which line of code is the problem? If not, check the error message again to &lt;strong&gt;isolate&lt;/strong&gt; the problem. Is there a new word in the error message that you haven’t seen before? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you practicing a new concept, one that’s complicated and might be interacting with your code in a way that you wouldn’t expect? Maybe the asynchronous function you're calling has timing problem that you've never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case then you might need to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-research-the-unfamiliar" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Research the unfamiliar.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, hands-down, my favorite part of coding. Every day you might face a new challenge, and every day that challenge can be an opportunity for growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of resources available online for computer programming is staggering. From articles that break down highly-specific edge cases, all the way up to complete Ivy League courses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to feel discouraged when you run into a new term/concept. Programming languages are massive, and this can happen every day! Instead, try seeing it as an invitation to go down the research rabbit hole. You never know which doors your curiosity could open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For beginners, &lt;strong&gt;reading the documentation is a secret weapon.&lt;/strong&gt; Every popular framework &amp;amp; library will have its own website that's dedicated to explaining its features and to show you examples. You should use a library's docs as your starting place for research, so that you can build a mental model of how a feature &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; work, which will give you a better idea of how you're trying to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-find-somebody-who-shares-your-problem" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Find somebody who shares your problem.
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rare, and especially rare at the beginning of your career, for you to have a problem that nobody’s ever grappled with. There are more than seven billion people on this planet- that’s a lot of engineers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage I like to get creative with my Google searches. Say I’m writing in JavaScript and I’m uncomfortable with ‘closure’ (and no, we're not asking my ex-girlfriend). Searching for the phrase “Javascript closure” is a good start, but “stackoverflow closure” will give me pages full of community-answered code examples, “r/javascript closure” will include 10+ posts on a wildly popular Reddit community, and that’s not even the tip of the iceberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first few walkthroughs that you find are dry or poorly explained, then there’s no limit to the amount of information you’ll find online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you’re at with your professional development, and no matter what you’re working on, the best thing you can do is keep going. Even if you went through all these steps and you’re still stuck, taking a 5-minute walk outside can usually break down that nasty roadblock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikechrupcala"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more programming tips, and DM me if you have any questions or if you’d like some advice. I hope this helped, and thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>15+ Structured learning alternatives better than a bootcamp</title>
      <author>Jasterix</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 17:02:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jasterix/15-structured-learning-alternatives-better-than-a-bootcamp-2ghb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jasterix/15-structured-learning-alternatives-better-than-a-bootcamp-2ghb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Now that I've started working full time, I created a new post schedule that offers more time to write research-heavy posts. The goal is to publish articles to a series every 3 weeks. But in between those posts, I'll write shorter articles (about work, programming, tech, etc) every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may change according to my work (and sleep) schedule but for now, that feels doable. I'm also going to start publishing on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzjalFENrQi940pjIbjxRw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;! Instead of launching yet another dev YouTube channel, I plan to use YouTube to answer specific questions directly.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Initially, this article was a list of the resources I've personally used to get up to speed on different programming things- concepts, syntax, best practices, etc. But as the list got longer, I realized it wasn't as much a list of random things, but a pattern and habits I've developed over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I've gotten good at learning the things I don't know. That is I've learned how to identify what I don't know and then how to learn them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of continuing down my original path for this article, I completely started over. To make it easier for you to apply, I'll instead be sharing the patterns and habits that worked for me and others. Keep an eye out for the FREE alternatives in each option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-off courses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Getting started is easier with a one-off course. Doing a Udemy course in a language (JavaScript), a stack (MERN), a focus (Frontend) of a goal (interview prep) will give you a broad overview of what to expect. These courses are also a great way to dip your toe in. I recommend doing a course as the first step, because it's an opportunity to explore a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; interest without spending big bucks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/"&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Since Udemy has frequent sales, you can usually find them at $9-$12 per course. The low price makes it a great way to try a few different things before deciding on a path. Many courses on Udemy are also geared towards beginners coming in with zero to little knowledge of programming. Don't be intimidated and just dive right in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/"&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I recently gained access to Pluralsight through work and I am loving it. Not only does it have beginner courses like Udemy, but it has a number of courses geared towards intermediate and advanced devs as well. &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/codefinity"&gt;@codefinity&lt;/a&gt;
 mentioned that some Udemy creators actually steal their content. At $29 per month or $299 for annual, it is a little pricey. However, if the thought of potentially shady Udemy practices makes you uncomfortable, Pluralsight may be a great alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://coursera.com/"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="//edx.org"&gt;Edx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn from top institutions at your own pace &lt;em&gt;FOR FREE&lt;/em&gt;. These websites offer a great way to build a strong CS background by letting you audit classes from CS globally. Classes are generally free (without a certificate). Even if you decide to get a certificate, there are scholarships available for those who qualify. This mitigates the financial and time pressures of getting a good education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming roadmaps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the hardest things for new developers is figuring out where to start. I know I wrestled with this for weeks after graduating from my bootcamp. Even a year into learning how to code, this remains a constant challenge for me. But there are excellent roadmaps that offer some guidance on where to focus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#4"&gt;Frontend Masters Handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I LOVE this website. It's a great next step from a one-off course. If you're interested in frontend and/or how the web works and/or web development with JavaScript, run (don't walk) to check it out. Not only does it outline what to learn, but it provides additional FREE resources and information for every point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"&gt;Open Source Society University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/ozone72"&gt;@ozone72&lt;/a&gt;
 shared this in the last article. But I wish I had known of this earlier. The name is pretty self-explanatory. OSSU enables you to build a core foundation in programming, math, tools, systems, theory, applications, and security. The syllabus might seem intimidating for anyone who dislikes math. But even then, I would recommend getting through what you can. Especially considering that the roadmap itself is FREE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. FCC is ubiquitous with self-learning. And as the name says, it's FREE. I actually never clicked with the actual FCC lessons/exercises format. But I found the structure useful for learning. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ"&gt;FCC YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; is also amaaazing. It seems to have a video tutorial for everything. Not to mention the community is very active on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths"&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Similar to FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project offers structured paths for building your CS knowledge. The platform offers FREE resources and the curriculum includes tons of projects for you to get your hands dirty. There's also an active community for you to ask questions or just connect with others who have transitioned into a software engineering role without completing a CS degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tutorials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I already wrote an article listing &lt;a href="https://dev.to/jasterix/27-programming-youtube-channels-you-should-know-4c39"&gt;my favorite YouTube channels&lt;/a&gt;. So with I'm not going to list that here. Instead, let's talk about how to to get the most from YouTube tutorials. But as you learn, you will find YouTube videos and tutorials extremely helpful for a few things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Concept bites&lt;/strong&gt;. When I learn of a new term, my first step is getting a quick explanation on that thing.  Starting with 5 minutes or less. &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/angelomiranda"&gt;@angelomiranda&lt;/a&gt;
 has a great channel for this. Switch to longer videos once you understand the basic premise. Once you're ready to learn how something is implemented, check out some tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Code alongs&lt;/strong&gt;. The best way to learn how to code is to write code, right? The next best is to read code. Coding along with a tutorial provides the best of those two worlds. I learned a ton by watching others code and seeing how they approach a problem. Just make sure you type out the code. It's tempting to copy and paste from the project repo. But you would be doing yourself such a disservice. Try to actually code along. Take notes. And write down your questions along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Code best practices&lt;/strong&gt;. This naturally happens as a result of points 1 and 2.  While job hunting, many people will tell you to keep building projects. But that's only effective if you're building good projects or building projects well. You can learn a lot about writing good code, implementing best practices, and avoiding pitfalls by watching tutorials where an experienced developer walks you through their project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Lastly, I wanted to touch on accountability and keeping a steady learning pace. The best thing bootcamps offer is structure. From 9 am to 6 pm, you're ushered from one lecture to another, you're tackling projects and asking questions. The impact of a structured learning environment cannot be downplayed. That is why I think it's critical that you create some structure for your days and weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/"&gt;Meetup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This is less available in person because of Coronavirus, but more available remotely! After graduating from FS, I made a point of going to 3 Meetups every week. One regular, weekday meetup was geared towards learning; one weekend Meetup spanned a few hours for getting hands-on support with a project or a lesson; the last one varied based on interesting events in the city. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many meetups operating remotely, you have the chance to find Meetups that work with your schedule nationally. Try not to go overboard with joining a million Meetups. Find 1-2 to start, and as you expand your knowledge, you can find additional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://discord.com/"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The same is true for Slack workspaces and Discord servers. Don't just join every community you come across. Instead, find 2-3 with an active community around the thing you're trying to learn. From my own communities, I've been able to get feedback on my resume, introductions to companies, and, more importantly, comradery. Learning to code is a tough journey with lots of pitfalls, frustrations, and moments where you wonder if it's worth the hassle. Don't try to go at it alone when you don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone who knows me IRL knows I'm a huge fan of Anki cards! Anki is a spaced repetition tool that helps you remember facts. The less you remember, the more it reminds you and vice versa. I first came across them while looking for ways to build my CS vocabulary and to transform what I read into long-term memory. Commit 30 minutes everything morning to reviewing your Anki cards and you will be surprised at how much you retain in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://chingu.io/"&gt;Chingu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. An amazing community and program. The great thing about bootcamps is they offer a lot of projects to work on. The not-so-great thing is that you're working on the same projects as every other student. Chingu changes that completely. It's a program that lets you work in a team of developers at your level to create real-world apps. Chingu also mimics the on-the-job experience of doing sprints on a team with scheduled deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A technical blog&lt;/strong&gt;. Lastly, blog your progress. I originally started this blog to track my own learning, while at my bootcamp. My goal was to summarize concepts I learned that day in as few words as possible. Keeping each post to 2 minutes forced me to review that concept and made sure I understood it well enough to explain it to someone else. While many people consider blogging a resume builder, I think it's also a great resource for interview prep. Because I wrote the articles and kept them short, my blogs have been a great resource for reviewing ahead of an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Wow, I haven't written such a long blog in a minute! I typically shy away from them because they can be overwhelming. Was it too much at once? This post is at least 5 posts in 1. Each time I thought I was done, something else came to mind to add. Let me know if you prefer the shorter 1-2min reads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, I'm happy to offer additional details into any one of these resources. There are even more FREE resources and strategies like these to facilitate your learning if you know where to start.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also-- I've been exploring different avenues for answering your questions. This might be via &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzjalFENrQi940pjIbjxRw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lounecl/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or even TikTok (maybe). If there's anything you'd like me to share, please leave it in the comments or reach out on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lounecl"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. This could be about my Leap apprenticeship, joining my current team at Microsoft, the headaches of switching from JavaScript to .Net, or anything else I'm learning. My goal is to help you through your transition into tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I uploaded my first YouTube video here. Just to give you an idea of what the channel will look like. The quality is a little rough, but it will get better 😂😂&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angular CDK - Platform Module</title>
      <author>Maina Wycliffe</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 16:46:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/this-is-angular/angular-cdk-platform-module-2pac</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/this-is-angular/angular-cdk-platform-module-2pac</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we are going to take a look at the Platform Module from Angular CDK. The platform module provides you with information about the current platform where your web app is running on, such as OS, Browser, Rendering Engine, etc. It also gives you information on the features the platform supports such as scroll behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables you to identify the platform where your app is running on and modify the behavior of your Angular app appropriately. The CDK Platform Module makes the following information available to you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Android - Whether the OS is Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is iOS - Whether the OS is iOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Firefox - Whether the browser is Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Edge - Whether the browser is Edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Safari - Whether the browser is Safari&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Blink - Whether the rendering engine is Blink&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Webkit - Whether the rendering engine is WebKit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Trident - Whether the rendering engine is &lt;a href="https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Trident_(software)"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supported Input Types - A list of input form field types supported by the browser i.e. number, password, radio, range, reset, search, submit, tel, text, time, url, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the browsers supports &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior"&gt;Scroll Behavior&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Whether the browser supports &lt;a href="https://web.dev/uses-passive-event-listeners/"&gt;passive event listeners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using yarn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn add @angular/cdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install @angular/cdk using yarn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using NPM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @angular/cdk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Install @angular/cdk using npm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will need to import the &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/code&gt; inside our app module, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// other imports&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... components&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other modules&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using feature or shared modules, you will need to import &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; inside the module where the component using it is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we are going to inject the &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; service into the component where we want to use the platform information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other imports&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... component metadata&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can determine the browser platform information as shown below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ANDROID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if OS is android&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FIREFOX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if Browser is Firefox&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if OS is iOS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BLINK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if render engine is Blink&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isBrowser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if the app is being rendered on the browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For an up-to-date reference for the API, please refer to the official docs &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/platform/api"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to implement a share functionality for our web app, where on mobile devices i.e. iOS and Android, we will use native share while on Desktop, we will use share buttons for each Social Media Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the &lt;code&gt;PlatformModule&lt;/code&gt; to determine if the user is on &lt;code&gt;iOS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Android&lt;/code&gt;, and then we will use the &lt;a href="https://web.dev/web-share/"&gt;WebShare API&lt;/a&gt;. For other devices i.e. Desktop, we will just show a simple twitter share button instead. Here is what our component looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@angular/cdk/platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;app-social-share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./social-share.component.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./social-share.component.scss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SocialShareComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OnInit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hashtags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;tweetShareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ngOnInit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// show native share if on Android and IOS and if it is supported&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nativeShare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;navigator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;substr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shareUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our share component above, has a property named &lt;code&gt;isNativeShareSupported&lt;/code&gt; - which is a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;. We are checking whether the current browser supports native share, and the platform is iOS or Android before setting that property to true. And then we can use this property to show the correct UI, as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;*ngIf=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"isNativeShareSupported; else showSocialShareButton"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;(click)=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nativeShare()"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"space-x-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Share this article&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ng-container&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ng-template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;#showSocialShareButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  Share on this article: &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"_blank"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;[href]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"tweetShareUrl"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Twitter&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ng-template&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we have learned how to use CDK &lt;code&gt;Platform Module&lt;/code&gt; to check the platform details in which our app is running on. This is a simple and quite useful way of modifying the behavior of your Angular app based on the platform being used. This can lead to an improved UX as you can enable enhanced features to users with access to them while providing a decent fallback to users without access to the enhanced features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow! Today is International Women's Day. I am glad that this day officially exist to give value and honor to all the women in the world who are making great difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like count myself in for making a difference and also to my mother who is not with me in this world today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#about-me-" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  About Me :)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name &lt;a href="https://jonahandersson.tech/"&gt;Jonah Andersson&lt;/a&gt; is a Filipina-Swedish Software Developer at Forefront Consulting, Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied Computer Science, Agile System Development i C# .NET, and Programming in Java. I had a childhood dream of being an architect or civil engineer but due to life circumstances, I  ended up studying about the science of computers and programming and she didn’t regret that! In fact, I enjoys being a programmer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoys solving challenging complex problems, coding back-end and has great interest in developing applications full-stack in C# .NET using new technologies such as Microsoft Azure. From time to time, I shares my technical knowledge at some virtual conferences and user groups on my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to teach programming to kids in schools and saw the gender inequality problem there. I volunteer to mentor and to help make a difference by inspiring tech to young women. I like to connect with other developers, share my technical skills with others, and personally helping out with gender diversity and inclusion in my workplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Q5cfBMB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r5arigvq7xg7qeb5f9o.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9Q5cfBMB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8r5arigvq7xg7qeb5f9o.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-inspiring-story-to-tech-and-software-engineering" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Inspiring Story To Tech and Software Engineering
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My journey to starting a career to the tech industry is a long, challenging and inspiring story. It all started in the Philippines where I grew up. When I was a young girl, I got to watch a story about the amazon women, back then when I was a kid, they were used to be known to be fierce female warriors. Different, strong and brave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I wanted to be different and strong like the amazon women I’ve been on TV. However, I was not as brave when I was a young girl. I was shy and was scared to be in the crowd. My mother used to encourage me to face that fear. My choice of dream job and education were influenced by my dreams and what I wanted myself to be - to be different, brave, and strong. That somehow influenced me. I had a dream to become a civil engineer, which was back then known to be a men-dominated job wherever you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dream job didn’t happen because of life circumstances and economic reasons. In the Philippines, getting a good degree in a good college or a university is not free. We don’t have that privilege of free university education. However, we have scholarship programs supported by private organizations or the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my parents could not afford to send me to college and take the civil engineering degree that I dreamed of, I took the initiative of taking a government scholarship that was offered in my high school back then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to go to the university and chase my dreams. So, when I was finishing high school, I took a scholarship exam offered. I took the scholarship exam, I passed it and I did it. I got the scholarship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I did not not have the option to study civil engineering in my scholarship program, but I was really glad. I had the opportunity to study Computer Science at a private college Asian College of Science and Technology in the Philippines. I studied a degree in Computer Science as a scholar and graduated in 2004. It was also the toughest year in my life when my mother (also my best-friend mom) died of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just turned 18 years old then. When my mother died, as the eldest child in the family, I was forced to take the responsibility of being the breadwinner of the family. Instead of finding a job within the programming field, I took the first job as technical support that I could have back then to earn a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved from the Philippines to Sweden 9 years ago, I decided to pursue my passion and dream to work with software engineering. I studied more about software development in programming languages C# and Java for another 3 years until I got my first job as a full stack software developer in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

  Volunteering - Mentorship and Being A Role-Model To Fix Gender Diversity Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December 2020, I was invited to speaking at Virtual Azure Community Day. One of the topics I proposed talking was about Gender Inequality Problem in Tech. In that talk, I presented to the public the list of reasons, what I think we should do and what I am doing myself to fix it. You can watch my talk about it on &lt;a href="https://azureday.community/english-december-2020/gender-equality-in-tech-why-is-it-a-problem-and-how-can-we-fix-it/"&gt;Gender Inequality in Tech - Why Is it a problem and How can we fix it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  The things I've learned working as a woman in tech and working in software engineering field
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am a programmer who is expected to think logically, I am also a deep thinker and a reflective person. I have learned a lot in life and through the years so far working as a woman in tech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned to keep learning from whatever challenges I face. To think outside the box. To learn how to see things in a bigger perspective yet understand what small details. To never take things personally if there are people who drag me down and belittles me. To be myself, be unique and to never pretend to be a better person you are not - just to prove myself to others expectations. To be open and true to yourself and work to your goals - not for others, but for the best self. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Advice to all women and anyone who belongs to underrepresented groups who want to work in Tech Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow your heart, your dreams, dare speak up and never give up! To find a good mentor and good role models. Follow the desires of your heart and what you want to achieve. To never give when everything seems hopeless. Value your good contacts and network with people in tech. Dare speak up your thoughts even if you feel uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another 8th of March, yet we are not still there!
</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Where are we about equality in tech in 2021? Aren't we still there yet? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long does it take to get there to have true equality in the tech industry? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time of the pandemic and working from home shouldn't absorb people's voices and give companies to be a ghost if there are employees who belong to minority groups in tech who haven't have sufficient resources to be productive at home and can't raise their voices enough. It is the responsibility of the organization which needs to push and makes sure to have people's voices heard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still seeing posts in 2021 telling us that if you want more women in tech then start training them. I believe to the opposite that it's not the problem we don't have enough women educated in tech, but the problem should be somewhere else if you don't see enough in your organization. I believe unconscious bias is something serious as much as conscious bias and people should have trained regularly since unconscious bias could be a very sneaky disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about the math of the problem to get the equality equation right, you need to put absent positive values to fill the gap from the past that we had collected enough negative ones. The inevitable result is that the equation will never be achieved if only women who are the one embracing the equality approach in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To seeing enormous companies which we had seen diversity term in action when they were a start-up are taking the backward side of the road is just frustrating. Carrying the diversity in a company shouldn't be reminding employees that they are not male in tech, diversity should be about different voices we have that would contribute our products from different angles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reports by TrustRadius[1], women are more likely to be laid off and have more pressure in terms of productivity than men in the tech industry which is still having issues about under-represented women. In addition to the burden taken by women for child care is 20% higher than men and the pandemic increases family responsible by 60%, we should be aware of the pandemic, and working from home opens the gap in terms of equality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel very lucky to see people in my organization embracing the same approach. I have started my tech journey when I was in high school and started to deny the fact that it is a male-dominated environment. Now I'm finally feeling that I can raise my voice in my organization freely and my voice has no different than majority groups, however, not every woman or minority in tech has the same environment and that shows that we are not even close to accomplishing equality in 2021. If we are concerned about newly graduated women will eventually face an unconscious bias somewhere in their path until finding the right environment, this means we have a lot to do. If you have never seen any injustice towards women in tech, raise your voice for others, but if you do, you should have been already raised your voice by now with no excuse. Look at the glass ceiling and break it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now if this is not the right time to face your work environment and make it better for being equal in terms of diversity, then when is? I believe this is time to ask if we are where we want to be in terms of equality in the tech industry since every effort counts. Women do not need anything but equality on the 8th of march and every other day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's time for the tech industry to walk away from toxic masculinity and lead by example to the world. "The world is waking up, and change is coming whether you like or not."&lt;/p&gt;
