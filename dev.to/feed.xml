      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-exactly-is-an-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So what exactly is an API?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software components, operating systems, or microservices.  To simplify, an API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system’s response back to a user. You click “add to cart;” an API tells the site you added a product to your cart; the website puts the product in your cart, and your cart is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may hear the term “microservices” come up in relation to API. These, however, are not the same. Microservices are a style of architecture that divides functionality within a web application. While API is the framework in which developers interact with a web application. Microservices can actually use API to communicate with each other.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API lets a developer make a specific “call” or “request” in order to send or receive information. This communication is done using a programming language called “JSON.”  It can also be used to make a defined action such as updating or deleting data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#there-are-four-basic-request-methods-that-can-be-made-with-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  There are four basic request methods that can be made with API:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET – Gathers information (Pulling all Coupon Codes)&lt;br&gt;
PUT –  Updates pieces of data (Updating Product pricing)&lt;br&gt;
POST – Creates (Creating a new Product Category)&lt;br&gt;
DELETE – (Deleting a blog post)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-what-is-json-and-why-is-it-used"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So What is JSON and why is it used?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used to represent data on a server. It’s fairly easy to read by humans, and easy for machines/applications to understand. This is easy to understand as it’s outputted in key/value pairs, with the key on the left, and a value on the right. Keys are a fixed object defined by the application and will remain the same as with “category.” Whereas the values will be unique, such as “Shirts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-api-request"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an API Request?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several components of an API Request in order for it to function. Let’s go over these individuals and how they can be used to build a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#endpoint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Endpoint
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key parts to an endpoint that are used when making an API request. One of which is the URL. It may look like a regular URL but if you plug it into a web browser, you will receive a 404 error message. The second part is the path. The path will vary depending on what you are trying to accomplish. When we put these two parts together, we get a complete endpoint&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#header"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Header
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headers provide information to the client and server. Common examples of a header would be authentication credentials such as an “Auth Token” or “Client ID”. These credentials are provided to you automatically when you create an API Account. Another common header is referred to as the “Content-Type,” which informs the server about what type of content will be sent. For example, a commonly used content type is  “application/JSON” which lets the server know, we are sending JSON data across. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods are the actions taken when sending a request. Think back to the beginning when we discussed GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. These are all API Methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request data, also commonly referred to as the “body,” is information that will be either sent to or returned by a server. In the previous discussion of JSON, you can see an example of API data. The body of a request will sometimes require specific information before it can be delivered. An example of this is if you are editing a single product, the Product ID will be required before any change can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-rest-amp-soap-apis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What about REST &amp;amp; SOAP APIs?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While API follows a specific set of rules that determine how programs communicate with one another. REST &amp;amp; SOAP define how the API is presented. Each is similar in functionality but has several key differences and uses cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REST stands for “Representational State Transfer” and is the set of rules that developers follow when creating an API. REST is read using JSON as we covered previously. One of these rules is that the API should be designed in a way that is easy to use and will make sense for developers. An example of not following this rule would be to have the product endpoint “prod_839” instead of just “products.” This could cause the API to be fairly unpleasant to work with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAP or Simple Object Access Protocol is another design modal for web services. Instead of the typical JSON that REST API uses. SOAP uses a language known as Extensible Markup Language (XML). XML is designed to be machine- and human-readable. SOAP follows a strong standard of rules, such as messaging structure and convention for providing requests or responses. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</title>
      <author>Atul Tripathi</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 04:56:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/atultrp/introduction-to-data-structures-algorithms-167d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/atultrp/introduction-to-data-structures-algorithms-167d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings everyone, and thank you for joining me on this new playlist of mine, Data Structures, and Algorithms. You’ll learn everything needed to prepare for interviews, placements, and logic building in this course. This playlist will teach you how to create optimal solutions to your real-world problems. This course explores a broad range of data structures and algorithms. Furthermore, I have designed this course with the optimal requirements in mind and will try my best not to miss anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing you need to know is the fundamentals of C/C++ to get started with this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you can start here, even if you know Java well. The reason for adhering to C or C++ is to be able to write the code from scratch. These are very recommended since they make it easy to understand the fundamentals of these theories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#note"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Note
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to access the notes I have provided along with the course. So, without any further ado, let's start our Data structures and Algorithms journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-structures-and-algorithms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Structures and Algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's clear up our basics with these terms before deep diving into DSA.  Data Structures and Algorithms are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-structures-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Structures –
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are like the ingredients you need to build efficient algorithms. These are the ways to arrange data so that they (data items) can be used efficiently in the main memory. Examples: Array, Stack, Linked List, and many more. You don't need to worry about these names. These topics will be covered in detail in the upcoming tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#algorithms-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Algorithms –
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequence of steps performed on the data using efficient data structures to solve a given problem, be it a basic or real-life-based one.  Examples include: sorting an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-other-important-terminologies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some other Important terminologies:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Database – Collection of information in permanent storage for faster retrieval and updation. Examples are MySql, MongoDB, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data warehouse – Management of huge data of legacy data( the data we keep at a different place from our fresh data in the database to make the process of retrieval and updation fast) for better analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big data – Analysis of too large or complex data, which cannot be dealt with the traditional data processing applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#memory-layout-of-c-programs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Memory Layout of C Programs:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the program starts, its code gets copied to the main memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stack holds the memory occupied by functions. It stores the activation records of the functions used in the program. And erases them as they get executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The heap contains the data which is requested by the program as dynamic memory using pointers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialized and uninitialized data segments hold initialized and uninitialized global variables, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the below diagram for a better understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zeS7sQ6r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o6t2umniad0qlpry7en8.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zeS7sQ6r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o6t2umniad0qlpry7en8.jpeg" alt="Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this was all for the beginning. Data Structures and Algorithms are not new concepts. If you have done programming in any language like C, you must have come across  Arrays – A data structure. And algorithms are just sequences of processing steps to solve a problem. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being with me throughout the tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it. If you appreciate my work, please support.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Python- Intermediate course: Day 28, Summary of the week</title>
      <author>Aatmaj</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 04:24:16 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-28-summary-of-the-week-1ppf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-28-summary-of-the-week-1ppf</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-of-the-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary of the week
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-25-buttons-entry-and-textboxes-2d0n"&gt;Day 25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We covered the entry, button and the text widget. The &lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt; widget is a simple button which executes a action when clicked on. &lt;code&gt;button=tk.Button(form,text="Press Me",command=cmd)&lt;/code&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;entry widget&lt;/strong&gt; is a widget which accepts a single line input (text) from the user. &lt;code&gt;entry = tk.Entry(parent)&lt;/code&gt;. The value of the text can be obtained using the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;strong&gt;Textboxes&lt;/strong&gt; are just the same as entry widgets, the only difference is that we can add multiple lines to it. Just replace 'Entry' by 'Text' and you are done! Using the height and width attributes, we can set the number of input characters in each line. for the textbox. &lt;code&gt;text=TB1.get(1.0, "end-1c")&lt;/code&gt; returns the value of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-26-password-manager-tkinter-17p9"&gt;Day 26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We practiced the widgets learnt in the previous part by building a password management application. The application consists of two entry widgets and one button widget. In order to hide the password, we can use the show() attribute of the entry widget. &lt;code&gt;TB1=tk.Entry(form,width = 20,show="*")&lt;/code&gt; This hides the passwords in the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-27-entry-keypress-event-5d15"&gt;Day 27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We learnt about the keypress event. The keypress event is run when the user presses a key on the entry widget. In this part, we made a spyware application to scan the keys typed into the entry widget. Be sure to check the program later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epilogue&lt;/em&gt;- We all know that neither me nor you have ever seen each other. Learning in remote environment is a difficult, and teaching is perhaps even more difficult. Teaching is never a one-way process. When a teacher teaches with pattern, he/she expects that the student must respond back. Either with doubts, remarks or nods of approval. &lt;br&gt;
But friends, being remote, we cannot interact with each other. The only way we can connect is through the comments below. So I urge everyone to comment on the posts. Currently I am in doubt whether you all are understanding me or not. Should I speed up the pace or maybe explain more clearly? I am not getting any feedback from you. Any doubts, discussions, remarks or even a simple hi from you is a great source of motivation for me. So I look forward to your comments below...😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who have not yet made account in Dev.to, you can have a free easy sign-up using your mail or GitHub accounts. I would suggest the budding developers to create your GitHub free account right away. You would require to register sooner or later anyways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥&lt;br&gt;
Next day will begin from Tuesday📅&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contributing to The Open Source Community! </title>
      <author>Luigi Zaccagnini</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:59:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/contributing-to-the-open-source-community-fp7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/contributing-to-the-open-source-community-fp7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I start this blog post I would like to thank the Dev team for shouting me out on Twitter! It meant a lot and I truly appreciate it! Now, welcome to my blog post about me contributing to another developers open source project and how you can possibly find a fun project to work on as well! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-a-project-to-work-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding a Project to Work on
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this open source project by networking through my classes Slack to look for a partner. I ended up finding &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/drew5494"&gt;@drew5494&lt;/a&gt;
 who was also writing a static site generator in C++. If you are looking for a project to work on, you should try finding one on &lt;a href="https://github.com/trending"&gt;GitHub Trending&lt;/a&gt; or you can try commenting your favourite open source project for others to find! I was a little nervous to test and review a project in a language that I don't program in very often but, nothing wrong with broadening your horizon! Open source should be filled with learning and fun so don’t be afraid to try new things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-and-reviewing-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing and Reviewing Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I had to do a little review of C++ so I could get a stronger understanding of the code. Once I had a grasp of the code I conducted some tests to see if the features would work or break under certain situations. I noticed that I found bugs/problems a lot faster than I usually would in my own code. This experience really showed me that not only is it important to have your code reviewed but, having a fresh brain while reviewing projects makes debugging and testing one million times easier! Best advice I have read within the tech community was “If you are stuck, go for a walk and try again” it will save you the ten hours of staring at a screen because of a typo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some problems I found while reviewing were:&lt;br&gt;
*README didn’t contain tool features or examples &lt;br&gt;
*The input flag did not work with directories&lt;br&gt;
*The input flag work with text files only in the same directory of the executable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-review-on-octo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Review On Octo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting my code reviewed was very scary at first. Putting your code out in the open can be daunting but, will help you improve your skills as a developer. The one issue that surprised me the most was the version flag not working. It surprised me not because of why it did not work but, why did it work on my machine? The problem was I had a string in my version variable in my package.json. I was able to fix it by just removing the string and creating a custom yargs statement. The only other issue reported on my project was adding liquid tag support to the tool. That feature was recommended on my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/open-source-static-site-generator-3953"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt; post by &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/pandademic"&gt;@pandademic&lt;/a&gt;
 . Thanks a lot for the recommendation! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I have learned that testing and reviewing is imperative for the growth of a developer. Testing and reviewing helps developers learn new things, understand how to work with other developers and allows developers to try new things! What are some of your first issues you worked on in an open source project? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the links to both repository issues:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/LuigiZaccagnini/octo/issues"&gt;Octo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/drew5494/the-great-site-generator/issues"&gt;the-great-site-generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working together in Open Source Projects</title>
      <author>Emily</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:43:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hphan9/work-together-in-open-source-project-3kek</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hphan9/work-together-in-open-source-project-3kek</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The start
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the features of my command line application tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg"&gt;shinny-ssg&lt;/a&gt;, I was working with Diana to cross-check the source code of our projects. In general, we have to check for bugs, suggest improvement, and file issues on Github. &lt;br&gt;
We both use C# and .NetCore 3.1 to create the projects and therefore, the experience was quite exciting and I definitely learned a lot.&lt;br&gt;
It is just a pleasure to work with Diana. I have known her previously from my database and web classese and knew that she is such a hard working and bright girl. In addition, Diana worked at the company which I am now doing the internship at. She has used C# for a long time and have great knowledge about it. This was very evident from her code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested her application &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/glazed-donut"&gt;glazed-donut&lt;/a&gt; with all test cases and her code nailed it. All the features worked as expected and it generated appropriate messages to the users when there were any errors/exception. The only problem I could find about it is in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/glazed-donut/issues/3"&gt;generateHTML method &lt;/a&gt;, which she should have replaced the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br\&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with white space. Other than that, just a few minor typos on the read me file, but nothing major. &lt;br&gt;
When she reviewed my code and tested my app, I appreciated that she really spent the time to check every detail, giving me very sound advice and helped me file bugs which I did not find before. &lt;br&gt;
First, she mentioned the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg/issues/1"&gt;naming convention&lt;/a&gt; in C# and explained in details the good practices in the industry. Second, she found a &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg/issues/2"&gt;bug in my Page class&lt;/a&gt; which created an extra &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Third, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg/issues/4"&gt;exception handling&lt;/a&gt; was not good enough and she guided me to make it better. &lt;br&gt;
In the end, I am able to fix most of the issues but I need more time to improve the code and make it flawless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thought"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thought
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated Diana for reviewing my code so thoroughly. I found that testing and reviewing code is great way to learn and improve your knowledge/code design.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing code review</title>
      <author>TueNguyen2911</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:30:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tuenguyen2911_67/doing-code-review-pg7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tuenguyen2911_67/doing-code-review-pg7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing my static site generation program, I partnered up with &lt;a href="https://dev.to/oliverpham"&gt;Oliver Pham&lt;/a&gt; so that we could both review each other's code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issues-with-my-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issues with my code:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of issues can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/TueNguyen2911/tue-1st-ssg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My program was not perfect in many ways, I expected it to have some flaws which turned out to be true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues weren't severed, the program still functioned fine, but the HTML files generated had quite a few HTML markdown errors and the &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; command didn't print enough information. After some discussions, Oliver managed to fixed those issues easily, he also caused &lt;a href="https://github.com/TueNguyen2911/tue-1st-ssg/issues/5"&gt;a bug&lt;/a&gt;  but quickly patched it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-contribution-to-my-partners-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My contribution to my partner's code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a look at its issues &lt;a href="https://github.com/oliver-pham/silkie/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited to look at his Python code for the same program which is a language I haven't tried. Luckily, Python is not a hard language to jump into and his code was readable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first by I found was that his program couldn't open files encoded in &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt; because Windows' default is &lt;code&gt;Windows-1252&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second bug was caused by the input path having the current path, ex: &lt;code&gt;./file.txt&lt;/code&gt;, the program couldn't parse the title from such file path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, one of his functions that parses title from the text file(s) was a bit confusing so I shortened it using some regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity actually gave me more joy and more experience collaborating, I thought it was gonna hard as I was giving away my code for another person to criticize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it motivated me to test his program with a view to returning his help finding fault in my program, I wouldn't have this experience doing solo. Also, getting to actually use Github, making pull requests, talking to other devs, learning more about Python are valuable lessons to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learnings from release 0.1</title>
      <author>Ritik Bheda</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:20:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ritikbheda/learnings-from-release-0-1-14no</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ritikbheda/learnings-from-release-0-1-14no</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I am back and this week I have my experience and learnings to share on a project I worked this week. The project was to release version 0.0.1 of a Static Site Generator tool I am making for my course at Seneca College. The tool can take commandline input of text files or folders and generate html files for the same. More information about the tool and its uses can found in this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg-release-0-0-1-1mlp"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really great experience working on this project as I got a profound understanding on commandline tools, npm and Node.js development. The process also gave me a better experience using git and GitHub. Later, I found an amazing(luckily) partner &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067"&gt;Tuan Tan&lt;/a&gt; who is highly skilled at backend development and to be more specific, Node.js development. We met on our class Slack channel where he posted that he is looking for a partner and then I approached him for the same. We both helped each other by reviewing and testing each others code and finding possible areas of improvement on each others project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvising-tuans-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improvising Tuan's Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it was very new for me to test review someone’s code as I was doing it for the first time, but I found myself comfortable and confident enough to test his work after reading this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067/build-a-command-line-tool-that-converts-txt-to-html-3je5"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in which he explains how to use his tool. The tool documentation being so good, it was easy for me to install, run and test in my local machine. Well, everything worked perfectly and according to the requirements, and that did not surprise me, but the surprising part was it was done so amazingly that it gave a hard time to find 3 issues in the code! &lt;br&gt;
The 2 of the 3 issues I found were related to commandline options and the third one was related to version. The options part had an &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/5"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; that the output on the terminal was not align which I according to me, if improvised can give a better look of using the whole tools. The second &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/3"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; regarding options was that the tool was using commandline arguments as program variables instead of options. Improving this can make the work easier for the developer and can also make the work more organized. The final &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/4"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was related to the tool version. The program was not able to pick the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file which gave an error when I tried seeing the version number through the commandline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issues-in-my-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issues in my Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also helped me in reviewing and testing my code. I was eager for him creating issues so that I can work on them and improve my tool. His issues did not surprise me as I was sure I might have made a few mistakes during the development.&lt;br&gt;
He was able to find 3 issues in my code as well! He found issues of a typo, picking version from the file and program giving errors in special cases. I had a typing mistake in my code where I misspelled ‘successfully’ to ‘successfullly’. The issue can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The second &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/1"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was versioning related as he suggested me to pick the program version from package.json which could reduce programmers work manually updating it in every file that uses it. And the last &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/3"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; he found was input file/folder related in which he entered a file which did not exist. Instead of my program warning the user, it created an empty folder which was never expected. I later worked on all the 3 issues and resolved them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-takeaways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that everyone has different thinking style and approach to a problem. I learned how my thinking style affects the problem I am working on. I also learned from his experience on the projects testing and reviewing about Node.js development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find the project and lab related these links helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSG for generating html</title>
      <author>jsong89</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:17:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/ssg-for-generating-html-2eib</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/ssg-for-generating-html-2eib</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSD600&lt;/strong&gt; feels like a subject that composes a program (?) on a specific topic by mobilizing everything that has been learned so far. In the first week, instructions were released to create release 0.1, and I tried to tailor the code as best as possible to the requirements of that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating the api, I chose node js, which I was most confident and used the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I created a repository in Git and named it "jun-ssg" after me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-ssg-for-text-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The SSG for text file!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source Project 0.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jun-ssg is a simple html generator. You can extract your file contents and put them as HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before start to use&lt;br&gt;
After downloaded files delete the package-lock.json&lt;br&gt;
run "npm install" at terminal&lt;br&gt;
You can dowload and run the repository files -node src/app.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can run by npm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm i -g &lt;a href="https://github.com/juuuuuuun/jun-ssg.git"&gt;https://github.com/juuuuuuun/jun-ssg.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example statements&lt;br&gt;
Options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-i, --input Input a file or a directory [string] [required]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-o, --output Specify the output directory [string]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-s, --stylesheet Import css URL [string]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-v, --version Show version number [boolean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-h, --help Show usage information [boolean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples: After install my package, jun-ssg -i 'Silver Blaze.txt'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning my repository&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UsCPbKK3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ljpioxhj5y1x77sau6w.png" alt="1"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After complete the cloning terminal should show like this&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i65RlVkj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4wgsq3p2ukftnzbuasl.png" alt="2"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the dir location to the cloned folder&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UrylB25a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/697udi8h3vbuex6gz8wf.png" alt="3"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run "npm install" to use pre-set npm modules&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUSQQDlY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q49q02gjqxz6momm2ojl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUSQQDlY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q49q02gjqxz6momm2ojl.png" alt="4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to run "node src/app.js" if everything is fine the terminal should show how to use this api.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUx3bS3r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fp6v4utel61e3thoo89t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUx3bS3r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fp6v4utel61e3thoo89t.png" alt="5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type any command which is set, but in this case will run -input option type "node src/app.js -i 'Sherlock-Holmes-Selected-Stories'".&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1zG6JxgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vegjcm7qwhs3441u5hd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1zG6JxgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vegjcm7qwhs3441u5hd.png" alt="6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check generated htmls.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mkg01tA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vizppsak96u3s5o07pq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mkg01tA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vizppsak96u3s5o07pq.png" alt="7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, you can apply any css stylesheet like this way.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajgbtADk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8saqdx6ipjtotrgu794.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajgbtADk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8saqdx6ipjtotrgu794.png" alt="8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can see the htmls with nice design :)&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvNbbVH2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nvevrr4lui0wllrcheq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvNbbVH2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nvevrr4lui0wllrcheq.png" alt="9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text file what you wished.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pdq51OVC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u20bvotlne1mylgv85ih.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pdq51OVC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u20bvotlne1mylgv85ih.png" alt="10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Review nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;Lock EJF351BLK</title>
      <author>Hana Do</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 02:41:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hanado2801/review-noi-chien-khong-dau-locklock-ejf351blk-185p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hanado2801/review-noi-chien-khong-dau-locklock-ejf351blk-185p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://locknlockvietnam.com.vn/noi-chien-khong-dau/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ngay từ khi xuất hiện đã trở thành món đồ không thể thiếu trong bếp của mỗi gia đình. Với công nghệ làm chín hiện đại, nồi chiên Lock&amp;amp;Lock dầu giúp người dùng được thỏa mãn đam mê thưởng thức những món đồ chiên rán mà không phải hấp thụ quá nhiều chất béo từ dầu mỡ. Trong đó, nổi bật là sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK được đánh giá là một trong những sản phẩm được ưa chuộng nhất của thương hiệu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-n%E1%BB%93i-chi%C3%AAn-kh%C3%B4ng-d%E1%BA%A7u-lockamplock-ejf351blk-c%C3%B3-%C4%91%C3%A1ng-s%E1%BB%AD-d%E1%BB%A5ng"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK có đáng sử dụng?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Để đánh giá sản phẩm có tốt hay không, trước tiên hãy cùng chúng tôi tìm hiểu những tính năng, đặc điểm của sản phẩm nhé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-v%E1%BB%81-thi%E1%BA%BFt-k%E1%BA%BF"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.1. Về thiết kế&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sản phẩm được thiết kế với hình bầu dục to tròn. Chất liệu sản phẩm được làm từ nhựa PP cao cấp, có khả năng chịu lực và chịu nhiệt tốt. Với chất liệu nhựa mà màu sắc chủ đạo là đem bóng, nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK sở hữu một vẻ ngoài sang trọng, hiện đại và trang nhã, phù hợp với mọi không gian bếp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-c%C3%B4ng-su%E1%BA%A5t-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.2. Công suất sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thông thường với các thiết bị sử dụng điện thì dung tích càng lớn, lượng điện năng tiêu thụ sẽ càng nhiều, gây tốn điện năng. Tuy nhiên, với sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK, công suất nồi chỉ 1800 W với dung tích hơn 5L, tiết kiệm điện năng hơn rất nhiều so với các thiết bị điện cùng loại như bếp nướng, bếp điện từ, nồi cơm điện, lò nướng,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQUqVkMv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uixzrgsxxtob7ltwtush.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQUqVkMv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uixzrgsxxtob7ltwtush.jpg" alt="Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock phiên bản EJF351BLK có đáng sử dụng?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-thi%E1%BA%BFt-k%E1%BA%BF-l%C3%B2ng-n%E1%BB%93i"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.3. Thiết kế lòng nồi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lòng nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK được thiết kế vô cùng thông minh. Nó có khả năng tháo rời ra dễ dàng khỏi giỏ chiên chỉ bằng một cái chạm nhẹ ở phần tay cầm. Điều này giúp cho việc sắp xếp thực phẩm và việc vệ sinh nồi sau nấu dễ dàng hơn rất nhiều. Đây là ưu điểm vô cùng tiện lợi cho người sử dụng mà chiếc nồi này sở hữu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#14-c%C3%B4ng-ngh%E1%BB%87-chi%C3%AAn-ch%C3%A2n-kh%C3%B4ng-ti%C3%AAn-ti%E1%BA%BFn-h%C3%A0ng-%C4%91%E1%BA%A7u-hi%E1%BB%87n-nay"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.4. Công nghệ chiên chân không tiên tiến hàng đầu hiện nay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock phiên bản EJF351BLK sử dụng công nghệ chiên chân không kết hợp cùng công nghệ Rapid Air hiện đại, giúp nhiệt độ có thể nóng lên tới 360 độ, làm thực phẩm được chín đều, giữ được hương vị thơm ngon, nguyên vị mà không hề đọng lại dầu mỡ. Bên cạnh đó, luồng khí nóng bên trong nồi cùng với thiết kế quạt thổi sẽ giúp hơi nóng được tải đều và rộng hơn trong lòng nồi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Như vậy, với chiếc nồi chiên không dầu này, người dùng sẽ không còn phải lo về việc hấp thụ quá nhiều dầu mỡ như cách chiên rán thông thường. Đổi lại, bạn vẫn sẽ được thưởng thức những món ăn ngon mà không hề phải sử dụng chút dầu mỡ nào. Điều này cực kỳ có lợi cho sức khỏe của người sử dụng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#15-dung-t%C3%ADch-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.5. Dung tích sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dung tích của sản phẩm cũng là một trong những ưu thế mà chiếc nồi chiên EJF351BLK có được. Sản phẩm có dung tích lớn lên tới 5.2L. Điều này đồng nghĩa với việc người dùng có thể chế biến lượng lớn thức ăn, đủ phục vụ cho gia đình đông từ 6-8 người. Hoặc với những gia đình ít người nhưng thích ăn đồ chiên, nướng, đây cũng chính là chiếc nồi cực kỳ phù hợp và tiện dụng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#16-t%C3%ADnh-n%C4%83ng-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.6. Tính năng sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thay vì phải vệ sinh bằng các dung dịch chuyên dụng, nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK có thể dễ dàng tháo rời để rửa sạch bằng nước rửa chén thông thường. Ngoài ra, bạn cũng có thể cho phần lòng nồi vào máy rửa chén để rửa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sản phẩm còn được tích hợp nhiều chức năng ưu việt khác như: Có thể cài sẵn thời gian nấu lên tới 30 phút, có thể tự do điều khiển nhiệt độ cho phù hợp với từng giai đoạn của món ăn, nhiệt độ tối đa lên tới 200 độ C nên có thể dùng để nướng bánh, rau củ, tôm cua, thịt cá, hải sản,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-%C6%B0u-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m-c%E1%BB%A7a-n%E1%BB%93i-chi%C3%AAn-kh%C3%B4ng-d%E1%BA%A7u-ejf351blk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Ưu nhược điểm của nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sau đây, hãy cùng chúng tôi phân tích những điểm nổi trội và còn cần cải thiện của sản phẩm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#21-v%E1%BB%81-%C6%B0u-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;2.1. Về ưu điểm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiếc nồi sẽ giúp bạn tiết kiệm thời gian nấu nướng với chế độ cài sẵn giờ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hạn chế hấp thụ dầu mỡ, chất béo có hại cho sức khỏe mà vẫn được thưởng thức các món ăn chiên, nướng ngon, đảm bảo sức khỏe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hạn chế nguy cơ đồ ăn bị cháy khét, gây hại cho sức khỏe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiết kiệm dầu mỡ vì gần như không sử dụng đế&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Người dùng sẽ hoàn toàn thoát khỏi nỗi ám ảnh dọn dẹp bãi chiến trường sau khi nấu ăn. Việc vệ sinh vô cùng đơn giản vì khay nồi được lót một lớp chống dính, thiết kế khau và rá chiên rời nhau lại không bị bắn như khi dùng chảo hay lò nướng nên việc vệ sinh dễ dàng, nhanh chóng hơn rất nhiều&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dung tích nồi lớn có thể sử dụng cho các gia đình đông thành viên&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Công nghệ chiên thông minh giúp thực phẩm chín đều, tươi ngon, giữ được nguyên vị món ăn, không bị ám mùi khói&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nhiệt độ tối đa lên tới 200 độ và có thể cài thời gian nấu tự động trong 30 phút, giúp bạn chế biến đa dạng món ăn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acPsqK30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0e5jdt26aqoltbq4s8qj.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acPsqK30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0e5jdt26aqoltbq4s8qj.jpg" alt="Ưu điểm và nhược điểm của nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#22-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;2.2. Nhược điểm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bên cạnh các ưu điểm kể trên, sản phẩm vẫn còn những nhược điểm như:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giá thành khá cao so với các loại nồi thường khác&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lớp chống dính sẽ khá mỏng nên khi lau chùi, vệ sinh cần cẩn thận để không làm xước&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sách hướng dẫn sử dụng hoàn toàn bằng tiếng anh nên đôi khi gây khó khăn cho người sử dụng&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trên đây là những ưu - nhược điểm của sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK. Dù còn một số nhược điểm nhỏ nhưng sản phẩm quả thực rất đáng trải nghiệm cho những ai đang tìm một chiếc nồi chiên không dầu chất lượng cao. Còn chần chờ gì nữa, sở hữu ngay chiếc nồi tuyệt vời này thôi!&lt;/p&gt;
