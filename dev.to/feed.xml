      <guid>https://dev.to/pablonax/20-best-libraries-for-flutter-developers-38ph</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How often do you use libraries in your work? I guess you do it all the time. Because good developers always want to be better. That is why they are always ready to get something new, and importantly, they always know where to find it. The CODE MARKET team has developed the top 20 best libraries for rookie Flutter developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#expandable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  expandable
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one on our list. This template is going to help you build a drop-down list to make your app more user-friendly. An irreplaceable thing.  Use this library to build a great product and cut development time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#maskedcontroller"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  masked_controller
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the first action the user sees when he runs the application? Registration! Registration must be easy and handy to keep users from running away. That is why you need to add controller to insert mask to textfield. This is a proven code used in nearly every application which has a registration via phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fluttermoneyformatter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  flutter_money_formatter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An indispensable extension for any e-commerce application. If you need to get price labels in your app, then here's everything you need. This extension allows you to format any currency based on your characteristics, without reference to localization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flchart"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  fl_chart
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best library for drawing charts. However, they are essential in various applications, ranging from financial apps to simple calorie counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shimmer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  shimmer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy to use and pleasant to the eye loading waiting screen. Users will definitely appreciate the efforts. And it won't be worth anything to you if you use the libraries properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fontawesomeflutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  font_awesome_flutter
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit different but no less valuable library. There are icons for any query. Perfect for getting started. Such libraries are good to know in order to save your time for working on something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#backdrop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  backdrop
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any novice developer, it is important to find their libraries to do their tasks better. Such tiny peculiarities, like this, in application development are extremely valuable, because they let you work with little effort so that it looks good and professional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#neatperiodictask"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  neat_periodic_task
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension will help with the regular launch of tasks in the background. It seems to be a simple case, but you can't do without a library here. This extension is not an official Google support, but allows you to run maintenance operations in a periodic background task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#urllauncher"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  url_launcher
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a very significant function to open links from your application in a browser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introslider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  intro_slider
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slider is a user-friendly extension for your application. Using this library you won't have to spend your time on it anymore. A couple of clicks and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bottomnavybar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  bottom_navy_bar
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usability of an app, as well as a site, lies in its navigation. If it's intuitive, and doesn't create extra questions for users, then this is success. That's why the bottom navigation panel is a hit, it's simple, clearest and close to every user. And the navigation bar from this library is also very easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#localauth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  local_auth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent feature for the app is log-in by biometric data. This library will diversify your application and make it up-to-date. This extension is suitable for both Android and iOS systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#percentindicator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  percent_indicator
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indicators, loading bars, all this is common, so there are a million different libraries on this topic. It's practical to use a library with proven code. It is very easy to use, so even if you are a beginner, you can easily handle the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cachednetworkimage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  cached_network_image
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page loading rate is very important, using cached images you will be able to keep more users. That is why every developer needs to know about this library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flutterinappwebview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  flutter_inappwebview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webview inside your application. To open pages in the browser light and breezy. Another essential item for every developer from beginner to professional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  dio
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best, tested and handy HTTP client for Dart. It 's actually very useful for making queries in a simplified way. This client supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request Cancellation, File downloading, Timeout etc. I suggest you keep it in your tabs, because it will definitely be handy for you, and it will definitely make your life easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pathprovider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  path_provider
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you need to locate a file on the Android or iOS file system - just use this plugin. This is exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#animations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  animations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of animation cannot be underestimated. Still images are simple, but also dull. To make your application more appealing to users, you have to use this power. This package contains a basic animation that makes even the most simple application entertaining. If you use animation correctly, then your application will look more professional. As if you spent a lot of time and effort on it. But in fact, you used libraries wisely in your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flutterlocalnotifications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  flutter_local_notifications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check your notifications, it looks like you are being reminded to use libraries in your work more frequently! This cross-platform plugin for displaying local notifications on user devices. Notifications are frequently disabled in applications, but they are still extremely important for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flutterslidable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  flutter_slidable
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another awesome plugin that will make life easier is sliding animation. Rather than suffer yourself, you can use this package. The package includes several types of animation: Behind Motion, Drawer Motion, Scroll Motion and Stretch Motion (example above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, tell me what we forgot? What libraries do you use? Share it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Search UI Component with React &amp; Typesense made Easy!</title>
      <author>Sankalp Swami</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 10:27:06 +0000</pubDate>

      <title>Saleor - a GraphQL-first open-source e-Commerce platform</title>
      <author>Tomek Poniatowicz</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 09:57:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/graphqleditor/saleor-a-graphql-first-open-source-e-commerce-platform-15a9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/graphqleditor/saleor-a-graphql-first-open-source-e-commerce-platform-15a9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives.  Because of the lockdowns, almost all of our activities have moved online. Work? Remote. Meetings? Zoom or Teams. Shopping? Ecommerce. One of the areas most impacted by the pandemic is the retail industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes have caused a significant acceleration of e-commerce, but also increased competition in the field. With such rapid growth and the race for the biggest market share, keeping in touch with customers and making sure they get what they need has become a challenge. Just as Zoom, Teams and other apps have helped with conference calls as remote working has entered the lives of most people permanently, automation and tools that allow for better management of sales, customer service and customer relations has become essential for the ecommerce industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#customer-relationship-amp-process-management-platforms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Customer Relationship &amp;amp; Process Management Platforms
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most basic customer relationship helpers are Customer Relationship Management (CRM) apps. CRMs are a sort of company archivists, keeping track of all matters related to its business operations in order to create a “company's memory" independent of the changing of its employees. The data gathered this way can be easily subjected to multidirectional analyses leading to more accurate business strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above definition was valid 20 years ago, currently CRMs have transformed into something more than just company business data storage &amp;amp; there's a lot more to them than that. Modern CRMs track every interaction with every client, the chain of email conversations and the progress of each individual customer case. This can be anything from tracking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potential leads,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sales,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchases,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customer support or complaints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength doesn't come from just having the data, but from being able to streamline the whole process through various automations and integrations, while still having everything in one place. This keeps the whole process and each case transparent and easy to analyze for the person handling it. CRMs evolved from a company archive into Business Process Management (BPM) platforms which, with a little of help from 3rd party tools, can be not only the company's archivist but also a sales and marketing person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mix-and-match"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mix and match
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said the strength comes from automations and integrations, because CRMs do not aim to be the be-all end-all. These platforms are aimed at keeping things tidy and easily accessible for non coders while most of the work happens in the background. Some of the more popular CRMs are Pipedrive and Pipefy, so let’s take a quick look at what they’re about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pipedrive:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vertical platform developed with sales in mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;batch processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sales force automation and sales tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pipefy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;horizontal platform developed to fit the needs of various businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to learn automations to make personalization easier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;custom workflow management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gPztBoyR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ojxs9kuvluaenvlfb6qa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gPztBoyR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ojxs9kuvluaenvlfb6qa.png" alt="With Pipefy you can create &amp;amp; automate business workflows easily" width="518" height="365"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-pipefycom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Source: &lt;a href="https://www.pipefy.com/"&gt;pipefy.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see here Pipedrive is focused on sales and Pipefy is geared towards a broader audience, still both use integrations to fill in the gaps, so if you need to hook them up with some other app, for example to import data, you’ll have to rely on those. They do have a bit of basic built in integrations with things like Slack, Zoom or Google Sheets etc. but if you need something else it's pretty likely you’ll have to use something like Zapier to bridge the gap. Alternatively you could also use web hooks or a little thing called GraphQL. While Pipedrive requires third party libraries, Pipefy does handle both GraphQL queries and mutations by design, so it is a lot more flexible in terms of what you can do with it using that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#saleor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Saleor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well if you’re a GraphQL enthusiast (and you probably wouldn't be here if you weren't one) this probably sounded like something right down your alley. After all, GraphQL is all about getting exactly what you want and not about jumping through hoops and integrations to get what you need. Well this is where Saleor comes in, a GraphQL-first headless sales platform. Most CRMs are geared towards non-coders, trying to keep everything simple by using tailored solutions and templates to make tracking everything easier. Saleor is a platform that helps connect that with both customers and developers, it’s aimed at providing maximum flexibility by giving them free reign over the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;aimed at developers:&lt;/strong&gt; no proprietary templates, just GraphQL, JAMstack, Next.js and modern front-end tools, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;simple integration:&lt;/strong&gt; teams don't need to focus on integrating various platforms (like CRMs) or tools and can just rely on the GraphQL API,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;frontend freedom:&lt;/strong&gt; it's entirely up to you how the frontend looks, you can write a client from scratch using the language or platform of your choosing or you can use use the default PWA storefront or JavaScript SDK,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;decoupled presentation layer:&lt;/strong&gt; the frontend is separate from your core business so you can manage any number of stores, apps, and devices from a single back-end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7JWs8V9D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jcw54be2fol0cvu4s243.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7JWs8V9D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jcw54be2fol0cvu4s243.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="676"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-aleorio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Source: &lt;a href="https://saleor.io/"&gt;aleor.io&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-it-for-me-though"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is it for me though?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always choosing the right platform depends on your particular situation and needs. If you just want something, which will make working a bit easier for sales people with no knowledge of coding a CRM is still very useful. But things tend to pile up over time, so if it's a bigger project you might find yourself using a bunch of makeshift integrations down the line (of which not all are free). That might prove problematic in case something stops working and will take additional time to get a hang of in case you bring new people in. Saleor is a solution that can help you with that as it keeps everything decoupled. Sales people work on the CRM platform, devs work on the GraphQL API and customers just see the end result. The only drawback is you'll need someone who knows GraphQL to make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to purpose-specific neural networks</title>
      <author>Rishal Hurbans</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 09:56:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/rishalhurbans/introduction-to-purpose-specific-neural-networks-5e0i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/rishalhurbans/introduction-to-purpose-specific-neural-networks-5e0i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are versatile and can be designed to address different problems. Specific architectural styles are useful for solving certain problems. Think of the architecture as being the fundamental configuration of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tUHjewLX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/txhlhnoc9y0a4ystg9wd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tUHjewLX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/txhlhnoc9y0a4ystg9wd.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="702"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed for image recognition. These networks can be used to find the relationships among different objects and unique areas within images. If you’ve ever searched for an image online, you have likely interacted indirectly with a CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas standard ANNs accept a fixed number of inputs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) accept a sequence of inputs with no predetermined length. These inputs are like spoken sentences. RNNs are useful in applications pertaining to speech and text recognition and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B_MU6oEE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ihmdx3vbj2lcejqmuysu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B_MU6oEE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ihmdx3vbj2lcejqmuysu.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="614"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A generative adversarial network (GAN) consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. For example, the generator creates a potential solution like an image or a landscape, and a discriminator uses real images of landscapes to determine the realism or correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---4y03j06--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uzfe34cmm29txp7oav0o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---4y03j06--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uzfe34cmm29txp7oav0o.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="612"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GANs can be used to generate convincing fake images and videos (also known as deepfakes), which raises concern about the authenticity of information in the media. They can also be used in extraordinary ways for CGI for movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cD-e560X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/igp397i1d8s1owl5phgn.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cD-e560X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/igp397i1d8s1owl5phgn.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's get started
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ flatten&lt;br&gt;
This snippet flattens an array up to a specified depth using recursion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;depth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [1, 2, 3, 4]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 6, 7, 8]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ forEachRight&lt;br&gt;
This snippet executes a function for each element of an array starting from the array’s last element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEachRight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEachRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '4', '3', '2', '1'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ forOwn&lt;br&gt;
This snippet iterates on each property of an object and iterates a callback for each one respectively.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forOwn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forOwn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'bar', 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ Get Time From Date&lt;br&gt;
This snippet can be used to get the time from a Dateobject as a string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getColonTimeFromDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toTimeString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getColonTimeFromDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "08:38:00"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ Get Days Between Dates&lt;br&gt;
This snippet can be used to find the difference in days between two dates.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDaysDiffBetweenDates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateInitial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateFinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateFinal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dateInitial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3600&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDaysDiffBetweenDates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2019-01-13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2019-01-15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6️⃣ getStyle&lt;br&gt;
This snippet can be used to get the value of a CSS rule for a particular element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ruleName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getComputedStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ruleName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// '16px'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;7️⃣ getType&lt;br&gt;
This snippet can be used to get the type of a value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'set'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;8️⃣ hasClass&lt;br&gt;
This snippet checks whether an element has a particular class.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasClass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;p.special&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;special&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;9️⃣ head&lt;br&gt;
This snippet returns the head of a list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;🔟 hide&lt;br&gt;
This snippet can be used to hide all elements specified.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Hides all &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; elements on the page&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How To Check If Array Is Empty In TypeScript</title>
      <author>Ondrej Polesny</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 09:12:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kentico-kontent/how-to-check-if-array-is-empty-in-typescript-573k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kentico-kontent/how-to-check-if-array-is-empty-in-typescript-573k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When processing JSON responses in TypeScript, how do you safely check if a variable is an array and is not empty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we get a response from an API (in this example, it's &lt;a href="https://docs.kontent.ai/reference/kontent-apis-overview"&gt;Kontent API&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;deliveryClient&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;blog_post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We expect that response to be an array of &lt;code&gt;BlogPost&lt;/code&gt; objects. Also, note the &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt; notation that allows us to unwind the response and select just the data we need. If the response doesn't have the expected format, we will get &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we first need to check if the response is a defined array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Response has a wrong format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Array.isArray&lt;/code&gt; function will catch all possible values:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// all these calls return false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({})&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// DON'T DO THIS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// as there is no need for checking the variable separately&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// DO THIS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Array.isArray() is doing the null and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// undefined check automatically&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)){&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Check &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray"&gt;MDN Web Docs&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we check if the array contains any items via &lt;code&gt;.length&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Response contains no items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it. 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full code looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;deliveryClient&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;BlogPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;blog_post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;No data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// all good here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blogPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also wrap the code in &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; block to make sure you also catch errors from network communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Developers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today let's dive deep into the world of CSS preprocessor Sass. We will learn what is Sass, how to use it, and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Sass?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sass stands for &lt;strong&gt;syntactically awesome style sheets&lt;/strong&gt;. Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular CSS gets very messy very quickly, That's why we use Sass, it provides us really handy features to make our CSS code reusable and logical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-sass-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does Sass work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing regular CSS code in a &lt;code&gt;.css&lt;/code&gt; file extension, we write sass code in a &lt;code&gt;.scss&lt;/code&gt; file extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we run a compiler and that compiler converts the sass code into regular CSS code. We need to process our sass code first and that's why it is called &lt;strong&gt;CSS preprocessor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#how-to-install-and-compile-sass-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to install and compile Sass locally?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before actually exploring the main Sass features let's see how to install and compile Sass locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: First of all we need to initiate the package.json file. So for that go to your project directory and run &lt;code&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn init&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on what you use npm or yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a file &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; which looks something like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;project name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;project description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;index.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Your name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Next let's install the Sass compiler in our project. Run &lt;code&gt;npm install node-sass&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn add node-sass&lt;/code&gt; in the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our package.json file should show node-sass as a dependency.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;project name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;project description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;index.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Your name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;node-sass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;^4.5.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Let's write a script in package.json that will compile the CSS code from sass code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the ex folder structure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app
└── index.html
└── css folder
    └── style.css
└── sass folder
    └── style.scss
└── package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The script starts with the package name (node-sass) followed by the sass file path (sass/style.scss) followed by the final CSS file path (css/style.css).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;project name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;project description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;index.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;compile:sass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;node-sass sass/style.scss css/style.css -w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Your name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;node-sass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;^4.5.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step 4: And the last step is to run the script. Run &lt;code&gt;npm run compile:sass&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;yarn run compile:sass&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it, we are ready to start writing sass code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#main-features-of-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Main features of Sass
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main features of Sass, let's cover these features one by one in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variables: For reusable values such as color, font-size, and spacing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nesting: To nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partials and Imports: To write CSS in different files and importing them all in single file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixins: TO write reusable CSS code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extends: To make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable is used so that we can use that same value everywhere in our code, for example brand color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color-primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#F56B27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$light-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color-primary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$light-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if we ever need to change the brand color, we do it just at one place in the variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nesting-selectors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nesting selectors
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have the following navigation markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navigation"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-list"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-list-item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-list-item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;About Us&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav-list-item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Contact Us&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we need to style the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is nested inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is again nested inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In regular CSS it will be done the following way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Styling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#F56B27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Styling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nested&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;inside&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Styling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;nested&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;inside&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;Change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;hover&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list-item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#00f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let's do the same styling, but this time with Sass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$brand-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#F56B27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$light-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$hover-link-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#00f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$link-font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$brand-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$light-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$link-font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$hover-link-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can literally nest selectors the way it is nested in HTML. Now, isn't it cool?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: In the above snippet we nested 3 levels deep. And to maintain readability we shouldn't go deeper than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mixins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mixins
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixins are used to write reusable parts of CSS code. For example let's say we have a footer with 3 links, which needs to be aligned horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we will use flex for that. But notice in the last example also we used flex to align navigation links horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer-nav-list"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer-list-item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;More info&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer-list-item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Careers&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"footer-list-item"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Team&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, the following code will repeat for both navigation and footer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.footer-nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of having to write the same code twice, let's write mixins to have a reusable block of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;reusable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;flex-between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;flex-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// used mixin here&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.footer-nav-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;flex-between&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// used mixin here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above snippet, we used the &lt;code&gt;flex-between&lt;/code&gt; mixin twice, without having to write the whole code twice. We just executed the DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#extends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Extends
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usecase of Extends is very similar to that of mixins but fundamentally they are different. The diff becomes clear in the final compiled CSS file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After compilation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code in mixin is pasted where ever we include it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas in extends it is the other way around. The selector is pasted where the code is defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain this with an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we have two different buttons with similar styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"navigation"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"signup-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sing Up&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"login-btn"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Login In&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First let's use mixins for similar styling.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;button-style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.signup-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;button-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;button-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is the result of final compiled CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;compiled &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.signup-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's use &lt;strong&gt;extends&lt;/strong&gt; to make the code reusable. And you will see the difference in the compiled CSS file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// extends starts with %&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;%button-style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.signup-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;@extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;%button-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;%button-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is the compiled CSS file when we used extends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;compiled &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.signup-btn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.login-btn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Look at the compiled CSS version of both (mixin and extend) and the fundamental difference will become clear to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#partials-and-imports"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Partials and imports
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also separate sass files as per the specific UI needs using partials and imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say our app has two sections a header and a footer. We can have 3 sass files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One sass file for header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second sass file for footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And third main sass file will import both header and footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here header and footer are partial sass files. The partial file name begins with an underscore (_).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sass/_header.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sass/_footer.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sass/style.scss&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"header"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"footer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Final folder structure&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app
└── index.html
└── css folder
    └── style.css
└── sass folder
    └── style.scss
    └── _header.scss
    └── _footer.scss
└── package.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/qviper/advent-of-code-2021-python-solution-day-8-76p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First part was very easy but for the second part, I took little help from &lt;a href="https://github.com/MasterMedo/aoc/blob/master/2021/day/8.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;collections&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;permutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;all_ps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;psl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;astype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;all_ps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;psl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;curr_ps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;choice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;curr_ps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;curr_ps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;all_ps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;curr_ps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all_ps&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;all_ps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;permutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"abcdefg"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;sol2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;            
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sol1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sol2&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later I knew there is actually a python generator &lt;code&gt;permutation&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;itertools&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/fayaz/sideproject-update-fluenticons-v2-np</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last February I had made a small weekend project and last month I released a version 2 of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fluenticons.co"&gt;Fluenticons&lt;/a&gt; is an icon viewer for Microsoft fluent icons. It has over 4000+ open beautiful icons which you can use in your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluenticons is now sponsored by Iconfinder, sign up and get $10 worth of credits (via the banner in fluenticons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-new-in-v2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's new in v2?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more hacks, I've used actual SVG's now, so I was able to add some new features like manipulating them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can copy snippets for SVGs, Vue component, React Component, HTML Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can download SVGs, PNGs, WEBP, Vue component, React Component now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate colors to see how the icon looks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More performant, loads way too fast now. (Scores 100 on Lighthouse Yay!!). Was surprised to see the site loading in 600ms when I moved from vercel to cloudflare pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's next?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an advanced editor like adding frames behind the icons. Inspiration - Bakery &amp;amp; Iconscout's Icon Editor (requires a lot a math, which I am not good at.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a npm package for others to use the components in their own web projects, probably looking a web component, maybe like boxicons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tech-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tech stack
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuxt.js&lt;br&gt;
Tailwind Css.&lt;br&gt;
Hosted on cloudflare pages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I built a History Twitter Bot</title>
      <author>Jayanth Acharya</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 08:42:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jayanthra/how-i-built-a-history-twitter-bot-22eg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jayanthra/how-i-built-a-history-twitter-bot-22eg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the titular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jayanthisabot"&gt;Twitter bot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Its daily mission : To recount what happened in history on that particular day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example on Nov 22, 2021 The bot tweeted a historical event that took place on &lt;code&gt;Nov 22&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;235 : Pope Anterus succeeds Pontian as the nineteenth pope. During the persecutions of emperor Maximinus Thrax he is martyred. &lt;a href="https://t.co/eecbAnRmCZ"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/eecbAnRmCZ"&gt;https://t.co/eecbAnRmCZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OnceUponThisDay (@jayanthisabot) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jayanthisabot/status/1462334309675806721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concept"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Concept
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is very simple, steps involved would be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get current date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get some historical event for that date: Wikipedia is a great source as you can search for a day and get all events for that day
eg : &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_22"&gt;November 22&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet it!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My task was made easy thanks to two wonderful npm packages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wtf_wikipedia"&gt;wtf_wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; : Library to parse data from wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit"&gt;Twit&lt;/a&gt; : Twitter API Client for node, Supports both the REST and Streaming API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these libraries the idea was to create a NodeJS app and host in publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-data-from-wikipedia"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting data from Wikipedia
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had the current date, I formatted it as required by Wikipedia search&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getFormattedDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLocaleString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the date is created I can use the &lt;code&gt;wtf_wikipedia&lt;/code&gt; to get the details of the page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wtf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeing the structure of the page, I would like to exclude &lt;code&gt;Deaths&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Births&lt;/code&gt; data and only stick to &lt;code&gt;Events&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poking around the json data, I decided to filter out the data as follows&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;deaths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;births&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLowerCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it is just matter of selecting one of the events by random from the events list.&lt;br&gt;
Some cleaning and formatting I finally have the link to tweet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomSectionList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomListItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomSectionList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomSectionList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ /g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;randomListItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageLink&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tweeting-the-event"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tweeting the event
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twit is a powerful library, I should probably use its other streaming features in future project, for now let's stick to the basics and just use the tweet functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial configuration would require some keys and tokens to be set in .env file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONSUMER_KEY=&amp;lt;CONSUMER_KEY&amp;gt;
CONSUMER_SECRET=&amp;lt;CONSUMER_KEY&amp;gt;
ACCESS_TOKEN=&amp;lt;ACCESS_TOKEN&amp;gt;
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=&amp;lt;ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These keys can be got from the Twitter developer console&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en"&gt;More on developer account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets tweet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Twit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;statuses/update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Tweeted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it!! the bot has searched for events in Wikipedia and tweeted. Now just matter of enclosing these functions in an interval so that the actions are repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set it tweet every 12 hours&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRandomWiki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hosted the app on Heroku.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Introducing Karpenter – An Open-Source High-Performance Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler</title>
      <author>Adit Modi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/cloudtech/introducing-karpenter-an-open-source-high-performance-kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler-7g5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At re:Invent 2021, AWS announced the &lt;strong&gt;v0.5.0 release of Karpenter&lt;/strong&gt;, marking its open-source, Kubernetes node provisioning project as production ready. With Karpenter, Kubernetes users can now dynamically provision underlying compute nodes based on pod specifications more efficiently than the existing Kubernetes &lt;strong&gt;cluster-autoscaler&lt;/strong&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karpenter is an open-source, flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler built with AWS. It helps improve your application availability and cluster efficiency by rapidly launching right-sized compute resources in response to changing application load. Karpenter also provides &lt;strong&gt;just-in-time compute resources&lt;/strong&gt; to meet your application’s needs and will soon automatically optimize a cluster’s compute resource footprint to reduce costs and improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Karpenter, Kubernetes users needed to &lt;strong&gt;dynamically adjust&lt;/strong&gt; the compute capacity of their clusters to support applications using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups and the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler. Nearly half of Kubernetes customers on AWS report that configuring cluster auto scaling using the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler is challenging and restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes-native cluster autoscaler is now production-ready according to AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OJLyuyHJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/976reljw8imknistt2r7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OJLyuyHJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/976reljw8imknistt2r7.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does Karpenter work, and how is it different than cluster autoscaler?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#karpenter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Karpenter
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are familiar with GKE Autopilot’s dynamic node provisioning process, you can view Karpenter as an open-source version of that tool, designed to work with any Kubernetes cluster (NOTE: currently AWS is the only officially supported cloud provider). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to GKE Autopilot, Karpenter observes the pod specifications of unschedulable pods, calculates the aggregate resource requests, and sends a request to the underlying compute service (e.g. Amazon EC2) with capacity needed to run all the pods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underneath the hood, Karpenter defines a Custom Resource called Provisioner to specify the node provisioning configuration including instance size/type, topology (e.g. zone), architecture (e.g. arm64, amd64), and lifecycle type (e.g. spot, on-demand, preemptible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ij9KkC0O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rbn48304spqk31n2fhae.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ij9KkC0O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rbn48304spqk31n2fhae.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="393"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip-side, Karpenter can also deprovision nodes when they are no longer needed. This can be determined by node expiry config (ttlSecondsUntilExpired) or when the last workload running on Karpenter provisioned node is terminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either of these two events triggers a finalization, which cordons the nodes, drains the pods, terminates the underlying compute resource, and deletes the node object. This deprovisioning feature can also be used to keep the nodes up to date with the latest AMI as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#karpenter-vs-cluster-autoscaler"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Karpenter vs. Cluster Autoscaler
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a cursory look, Karpenter works similarly to the existing Kubernetes cluster autoscaler project. After all, cluster autoscaler is also cloud-agnostic and can scale up or down based on pod resource requests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon a closer look, however, Karpenter provides several advantages over cluster autoscaler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes native scaling:&lt;/strong&gt; Cluster autoscaler for AWS utilizes EC2 Auto Scaling groups to trigger scaling events. Since ASGs were designed before Kubernetes, this integration is clunky and slow. For example, managed node group users still can’t configure it to scale nodegroups to 0, making batch workload types more expensive to run on EKS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No need to pre-provision node groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Cluster autoscaler can only provision nodes based on specifications provided by node groups, which require worker groups to have specific tags and work best with similar instance types. This meant that if you wanted to run performance tests, you needed to predefine a node group with beefier EC2 machine types for cluster autoscaler to trigger scaling events. With Karpenter, you can utilize all of AWS instance types on demand. Since Karpenter manages each instance directly without node groups, it is also much faster to request a new compute instance when capacity is unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Faster scheduling:&lt;/strong&gt; With cluster autoscaler, pods rely on kube-scheduler to create pods to new nodes once new resources become available. Since Karpenter manages nodes directly, it can immediately launch pods to new nodes without having to wait for the scheduler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Karpenter, we can offload node provisioning, autoscaling, and upgrades and focus on running our applications. Karpenter works with all kinds of Kubernetes applications, but it performs particularly well for use cases that require rapid provisioning and deprovisioning large numbers of diverse compute resources quickly. For example, this includes batch jobs to train machine learning models, run simulations, or perform complex financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
