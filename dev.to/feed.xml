      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codesphere is a simple and powerful development platform that combines a collaborative IDE, GitOps, and cloud services to streamline the development of scalable web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it's hard to imagine development without using git. That's why in today's article we'll show you how to use Github in Codesphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloning-from-github"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloning from Github
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are signed in, navigate to the My Apps menu, and press the New App button. You can then click on Clone Repository, where you will be prompted to enter the Repository URL for the Repo you want to clone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UB2BbSAX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ydp4xl9z0llstwxechwo.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UB2BbSAX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ydp4xl9z0llstwxechwo.gif" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For GitHub, the URL for a repository can be found by clicking on the green Code button and copying the HTTPS URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1K-PqR7k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zmwtogq6gq78yrs6jszu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1K-PqR7k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zmwtogq6gq78yrs6jszu.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply copy that URL back into Codesphere and press "Continue". After choosing a name and billing plan, Codesphere will clone your GitHub Repository, allowing you to use Codesphere to develop and deploy your web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 React Libraries You Should Be Using in 2021</title>
      <author>Reed Barger</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:21:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reedbarger/5-react-libraries-you-should-be-using-in-2021-4n4f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reedbarger/5-react-libraries-you-should-be-using-in-2021-4n4f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;📣 This post originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://reedbarger.com"&gt;ReedBarger.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at five React libraries that serve as a great addition to any React project you're looking to build in 2021 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The libraries I have chosen were selected because not only do they help us build functional and impressive-looking applications, but they also allow us to do so, faster, easier, and with less code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide I'm going to show you how to get up and running with each of these libraries from scratch and integrate them into your projects today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to build amazing real-world React projects with the best libraries? Check out the &lt;a href="https://reactbootcamp.com"&gt;React Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-react-query"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. React Query
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fetch data with React is generally a process that involves a lot of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You often need to use the useEffect hook in combination with useState to manage the fetched data. This requires a lot of boilerplate that we have to write in every component in which we want to fetch data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great library to use to cut down on the code we write for making network requests with React is React Query. All of this React code that we had to write before can be replaced with the hook &lt;code&gt;useQuery&lt;/code&gt;, from which we get back all of the data that we need without having to declare a state variable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c9NTsgQ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/react-query-1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c9NTsgQ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/react-query-1.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, making data fetching easier only covers a small slice of what React Query does. What makes it a very powerful library is that it caches (saves) requests that we make, so in many cases if we've requested data before, we don't have to make another request, we can just read it from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is immensely helpful to cut down repetition in our code, in the load we put on our API, and in managing our overall app state. If you pick any library to start adding to your projects today out of this list, make it React Query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-ant-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Ant Design
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making impressive looking React apps, there are many helpful component libraries that allow us to quickly style our applications with the help of pre-made components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of component libraries out there, but few that are as sophisticated and well designed as one called Ant Design. If you can think of a type of component to include within your React app interface and design, Ant Design almost certainly has it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---s6c49vu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/antd-1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---s6c49vu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/antd-1.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use a component library like Ant Design speeds up our development time by reducing the amount of often unreliable styles that we have to write ourselves. Additionally, these pre-made components provide functionality that is often redundant to create ourselves, such as a common modal or tooltip. In most cases, we should opt for the reliable, proven solution rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking of building an application today and are looking for a solid component library, go with Ant Design. It has virtually every feature that you would need out of a component library, plus great customizability that serves any app feature you might consider implementing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-zustand"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Zustand
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to managing state, React developers are often given two familiar choices: Redux or React Context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redux has been the go to third-party library for React developers to manage state, but with the arrival of React Context in React version 16, we have an easier way to manage state by passing it around our component tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a library with all of the functionality and power of Redux, with the simplicity of React Context, look at the library Zustand. It's incredibly easy to get started with, as you can see in the example below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1cP2Cqee--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/zustand-1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1cP2Cqee--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/zustand-1.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It involves using the &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; function to make a dedicated state object that can include any state values and functions to update that state as we need. It can all be created within a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, there's no need to use any context provider to pass your state to your app components. All you need to do is create a slice of state, call that created state as a hook, and receive whatever state variables and functions you've declared on the object within your React components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give Zustand a shot the next time you are looking for a more complex state solution like Redux for your application--you'll love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-react-hook-form"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. React Hook Form
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building forms in React, all developers know how tedious it can be to perform basic tasks like validating inputs, plus managing all the form and error state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most user-friendly form library available today is React Hook Form. All the functionality that you need in a form library is provided in one simple hook, called &lt;code&gt;useForm&lt;/code&gt; and enables you to create as sophisticated forms as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes control of managing our form state internally, gives us easy helpers to display errors for the appropriate input, and applies validation rules without any external libraries such as Yup, along with handling submission of our form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jeyWfa4x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/react-hook-form-1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jeyWfa4x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/react-hook-form-1.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to making building functional forms, you want a library that's easy to use and does not add too much code to our components. According to these two criteria, React Hook Form is arguably the best React form library out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-react-responsive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. React Responsive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no question--every React application should be created for users on different devices and needs to be responsive. Meaning, it needs to adjust the styles and appearance according to the screen size or device that your users are on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While media queries have typically been used in CSS stylesheets to hide and display different elements, the best React-based library to manage visibility or styles of React components is React Responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives us a convenient &lt;code&gt;useMediaQuery&lt;/code&gt; hook that enables us to pass in very precise conditions to determine whether users on a certain type of screen are using a certain device, they'll be able to adjust our user interface accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lg1ZSBiS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/react-responsive.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lg1ZSBiS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/react-responsive.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For making any React applications responsive without the use of CSS, be sure to check out the React Responsive library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Setting up my new Machine</title>
      <author>Laurie</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:56:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/laurieontech/setting-up-my-new-machine-549i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/laurieontech/setting-up-my-new-machine-549i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my new job this week, and that meant setting up a new machine. I have a set of tools that I'm comfortable with, so choosing what to download wasn't complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did find interesting is the tools I "just had to have" and those I haven't yet configured yet. A lot of my choices are available on my &lt;a href="https://laurieontech.com/uses/"&gt;uses page&lt;/a&gt;, but it also needs an update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with that, I'm going to talk through my must-haves this past week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#terminal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Terminal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, my terminal has become my programming control center. Who would have thought! When I first started doing development work, I was incredibly intimidated by the command line. I suppose building CLIs will rid you of that fear 🤷.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, my terminal setup requires a lot of things. Oops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://iterm2.com/"&gt;iterm2&lt;/a&gt;: I find this a nicer option than the built-in apple terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://ohmyz.sh/"&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt;: All my machines use this and I've gotten comfortable with it rather than bash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://starship.rs/"&gt;starship&lt;/a&gt;: This is a newer tool for me but I love the information-rich command prompts and the overall look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the look and feel of my terminal was ready, I needed additional software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://brew.sh/"&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;: The essential package manager for macOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt;: My JavaScript-loving heart can't live without it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also set up Xcode command line tools so I could get git working. But that was most of my first week essentials in terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#apps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Apps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was time to get my most-used applications. My machine came preloaded with &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, so I didn't need to worry about that. But there were a handful of other things I wanted right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;: My IDE of choice. I'll dive into this more in a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/"&gt;Magnet&lt;/a&gt;: I actually didn't download this until day three and was wondering why my monitor was bugging me so much. Windows managers are so key!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004115951-Elgato-Control-Center-Software"&gt;Elgato Control Center&lt;/a&gt;: This is how I control my lighting setup and make my video chats higher quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.getclockwise.com/"&gt;Clockwise&lt;/a&gt;: I technically downloaded the chrome extension and integrated it with Slack, but close enough. Calendar tools are a first-week necessity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-dark-mode/lgjhepbpjcmfmjlpkkdjlbgomamkgonb?hl=en"&gt;Google Doc dark mode&lt;/a&gt;: Another chrome extension, but this one helps my eyes a ton when I'm trying to do a lot of deep focus reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a surprisingly low number of apps. I'm sure it'll grow in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vs-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  VS Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the really good stuff. I'm a developer after all! As it turns out, I didn't do much coding in this first week, but I did look at a lot of existing projects. So what were my go-to extensions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ESLint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prettier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bracket Pair Colorizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indent Rainbow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript and Typescript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peacock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monokai theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's the current list! It'll get longer, but you can already tell that it's focused on readability. I don't necessarily know what functional helpers I'll need yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yay-first-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yay first week!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's my current computer setup. It's connected to all my existing hardware and you can read more about that on my &lt;a href="https://laurieontech.com/uses/"&gt;uses page&lt;/a&gt;. Thus far, I've done a lot of reading, had plenty of onboarding chats about logistics, and started to get a handle on what my new role is. Excited for what's to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🚀10 Trending projects on GitHub for web developers - 9th April 2021</title>
      <author>Iain Freestone</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/iainfreestone/10-trending-projects-on-github-for-web-developers-9th-april-2021-1968</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/iainfreestone/10-trending-projects-on-github-for-web-developers-9th-april-2021-1968</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trending Projects is available as a weekly newsletter please sign up at &lt;a href="https://www.iainfreestone.com"&gt;www.iainfreestone.com&lt;/a&gt; to ensure you never miss an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-reactspring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. react-spring
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;react-spring is a spring-physics based animation library that should cover most of your UI related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to confidently cast your ideas into moving interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmndrs"&gt;
        pmndrs
      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring"&gt;
        react-spring
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      ✌️ A spring physics based React animation library
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="ltag-github-body"&gt;
    
&lt;div id="readme" class="md"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/973c99d17e4ce72d08c4433449045d8391948711f11ac5f328a585e2a7bc8663/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f515a6f776e68672e706e67"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/973c99d17e4ce72d08c4433449045d8391948711f11ac5f328a585e2a7bc8663/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f515a6f776e68672e706e67" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;react-spring&lt;/strong&gt; is a spring-physics based animation library that should cover most of your UI related animation needs. It gives you tools flexible enough to confidently cast your ideas into moving interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This library represents a modern approach to animation. It is very much inspired by Christopher Chedeau's &lt;a href="https://github.com/animatedjs/animated"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; and Cheng Lou's &lt;a href="https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion"&gt;react-motion&lt;/a&gt;. It inherits animated's powerful interpolations and performance, as well as react-motion's ease of use. But while animated is mostly imperative and react-motion mostly declarative, react-spring bridges both.

&lt;p&gt;A boilerplate/starter project for quickly building RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By running a single command, you will get a production-ready Node.js app installed and fully configured on your machine. The app comes with many built-in features, such as authentication using JWT, request validation, unit and integration tests, continuous integration, docker support, API documentation, pagination, etc. For more details, check the features list below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a project, simply run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;npx create-nodejs-express-app &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;project-name&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;npm init nodejs-express-app &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;project-name&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Manual Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would still prefer to do the installation manually, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate.git
&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; node-express-boilerplate
npx rimraf ./.git&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;yarn install&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;cp .env.example .env
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; open .env and modify the environment variables (if needed)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the second edition of the Pro Git book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find this book online at: &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://git-scm.com/book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the first edition, the second edition of Pro Git is open source under a Creative Commons license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of things have changed since open sourcing the first edition
For one, we’ve moved from Markdown to the amazing AsciiDoc format for the text of the book; here’s an &lt;a href="https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/" rel="nofollow"&gt;AsciiDoc quick reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also moved to keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository
See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/progit/progit2/master/README.asc/TRANSLATING.md"&gt;the translating document&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="user-content-how-to-generate-the-book"&gt;
How To Generate the Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can generate the e-book files manually with Asciidoctor
We used to be able to build .mobi files (Kindle), but cannot do so now, see #1496 for more information
If you run the following you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; actually get HTML, Epub and PDF output files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ bundle&lt;/pre&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authelia&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source authentication and authorization server
providing 2-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your
applications via a web portal
It acts as a companion of reverse proxies like &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://traefik.io/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.haproxy.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt; to let them know whether queries should pass through. Unauthenticated users are
redirected to Authelia Sign-in portal instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is available at &lt;a href="https://docs.authelia.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.authelia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture is shown in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny library to put colors into stdin/stdout 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvinhagemeister/kolorist/master/screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bvzYFt5K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvinhagemeister/kolorist/master/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of terminal colors"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;npm install --save-dev kolorist&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;cyan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'kolorist'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;`Error: something failed in &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;cyan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'my-file.js'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also disable or enable colors globally via the following environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;disable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;NODE_DISABLE_COLORS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;TERM=dumb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FORCE_COLOR=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FORCE_COLOR=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that you can disable colors right from node:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'kolorist'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// Logs a string without colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also strip colors from a string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;stripColors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'kolorist'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;stripColors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'foo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// Logs 'foo'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Why autarky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's world storage is comparatively costlier than compute. Majority of devs uses MacBooks and sadly MacBooks have pretty low storage (for base models). Hence filling up storage is quite often and we spend a lot of time picking stuff to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 2019 and I got ran out of storage in my laptop after a thorough analysis I found out that the majority of the storage is occupied by &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. As each project have a separate node_modules (duplication despite the same version).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a few projects which I touch once in a blue moon, hence they end up eating a lot of space. On the other hand, picking &amp;amp; removing &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; manually is a tedious process. So I thought why not automate it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to resort to shell scripts

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portability is important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem at hand is compact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File system interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command-line program automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to search for an alternative

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensibility is required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding mission-critical stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell scripting is dangerous, use shellcheck and limit yourself in idioms used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer consoles are the second most important UX improvement in computing, surpassed only by window managers. Consoles went a long way from allowing the computer user to enter programs to be executed by a single-process operating system to converting them into toolboxes. Gladly, most of it was happening in Bell Labs under the supervision of the unstoppable innovator &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy"&gt;Douglas McIlroy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201004064728/https://www.multicians.org/mgs.html"&gt;Multics "shell"&lt;/a&gt;, just like inputs on other terminal-enabled computers of that era, was an instrument to accept a program and execute it on the Multics OS, the predecessor of UNIX. The earliest versions of the Multics shell already had input/output redirection. It wasn't until Douglas McIlroy &lt;a href="https://corecursive.com/021-gods-programming-language-with-philip-wadler/"&gt;discovered (not invented)&lt;/a&gt; command pipelines, it became a golden standard across all the operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pipelining and UNIX philosophy is allowing for writing small problem-specific programs that can be later composed. But the biggest reason for the usage of UNIX shell scripts in 2021 is portability. Indeed, every modern system has a UNIX shell readily available. Furthermore, often making a reasonably well-written shell script is "good enough for the job". But how does one do that? Let's explore the answer to this question, assuming that the reader already knows the &lt;a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/introduction-to-bash-for-beginners/"&gt;very basics of shell scripting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#minimal-shell-scripts-in-bash"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Minimal shell scripts in bash
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_VvTBfWy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://ctf.cdn.doma.dev/thou-shall-not-establish-bumblebee.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_VvTBfWy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://ctf.cdn.doma.dev/thou-shall-not-establish-bumblebee.jpg" alt='An Reannissance meme with an evil-looking man saying "thou shalt not establish bumblebee"'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let's get the most important consideration out of the way. Writing secure and reliable shell scripts is &lt;a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/MrMEEE/backup.html"&gt;almost impossible&lt;/a&gt;. The least one can do is to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shellcheck&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck"&gt;integration with VSCode&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, be very disciplined with user inputs and do your best to quote every argument that has a variable in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, with that out of the way, let's talk about step-by-step items one has to do to make a reasonable shell script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-your-shell-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up your shell environment
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting programming shells, we need to first determine which shell scripting language will we use. There are three schools of thought about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; by default. Bash is a reasonable middle ground between having a lot of features and being portable since it is shipped with each of the popular OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; by default and &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; when advanced features are needed. This is a purist approach. It offers the most portability but requires distinguishing between basic features and bash-exclusive features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; or some other "hipster" shell for everything. I'm mentioning this school of thought for completeness. Since it breaks portability, people who pick this option may just as well code in Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one can guess, we suggest simply using &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; for everything. Of course, Apple seems to be deprecating &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; as the default shell, but it's not going anywhere from mac os systems. Conversely, Windows 10 has support for reasonable &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; integration with its WSL programme. It requires some setup, but these days WSL2 seems to become the default for Windows development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; scripts have fine-grained built-in support for lowering the impact of the inevitable bugs. While setting up your shell, we suggest you use the following &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#The-Set-Builtin"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optionally add &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; for easier debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#command-line-argument-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Command line argument processing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, for some reason, want to use shell to write something huge like &lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/issues-legacy"&gt;a full-blown issue tracker with git backend&lt;/a&gt;, you'll need to use &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/402377/using-getopts-to-process-long-and-short-command-line-options/7948533#7948533"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getopts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/issues-legacy/blob/master/issues#L30"&gt;make your own despatch system&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, however, we shall consider simple argument processing. We heavily advocate for short and concise scripts that do one thing and one thing only, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's see how to print help:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
if [["$1" == "--help" || "$1" == "-h"]]; then
  cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOH
frgtmv: for each file read from STDIN, forget its filename entirely or amend part of it.
...
''frgtmv'' will then ''mv'' each of these files to ''\$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S%N')'', preserving the file extension.
...
EOH
  exit
fi

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOH / EOH&lt;/code&gt; "heredoc" syntax and make sure that we don't indent the lines under it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're escaping special characters like &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; with a backslash. If we wouldn't, bash would evaluate internals in a subshell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't forget to &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; after printing the help!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's use &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt;, a predicate checking if a variable is set, to prepare the variables needed. Often we want to set up defaults at the beginning of the file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
_mode="forget"
_pattern_from=""
_replace_with=""

if [-n "$1"]; then
  _mode="amend"
  _pattern_from="$1"
fi

if [-n "$2"]; then
  _replace_with="$2"
fi

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you would need to exit if an argument is not supplied. We use &lt;code&gt;-z&lt;/code&gt; that checks if a string is not empty for this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
# Exit if file or directory is not submitted or not a valid file or directory
if [-z "$1"]; then
  echo "We really need the first argument"
  exit 228
fi

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stdin-pipes-and-gnu-parallel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  STDIN, pipes and GNU parallel
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to receive input from STDIN through a pipe or user input. It's done using &lt;code&gt;read -r&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
while read -r _x; do
  mv -v "$_x" "$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S%N').${_x#*.}"
done

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you care about performance more than about portability, use &lt;code&gt;cat -&lt;/code&gt; to pass your STDIN to GNU parallel, following this pattern:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
function forget() {
  mv -v "$2" "$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S%N').$1.${2#*.}"
}
export -f forget # (A)

if [[$_mode == "forget"]]; then
  cat - | parallel forget {%} {} # (B)
fi

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;(A)&lt;/code&gt;, the parallel payload is implemented as a bash function. Notice the &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; statement! We suggest writing payloads that receive two variables: the parallel job ID (&lt;code&gt;{%}&lt;/code&gt;) and the currently read out item from the STDIN stream (&lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;). The payload is called from &lt;code&gt;(B)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some interesting &lt;code&gt;parallel&lt;/code&gt; techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;--keep-order&lt;/code&gt; to guarantee that the order of the input will be kept. Requires several file handles per input, which may turn out to be a bottle-neck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;find . -print0 | parallel -0 f {}&lt;/code&gt; to work in null-terminated mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;parallel 'echo "{%}:{1}:{2}";' ::: 1 2 ::: a b c&lt;/code&gt; will prarallelise a Cartesian product of input sets {1,2} × {a,b,c}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bash-parameter-expansion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bash parameter expansion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confusing many, if not all new shell users, "&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html"&gt;parameter expansion&lt;/a&gt;" has a veil of mystery around it. In our humble opinion, there are several causes for this effect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameter expansion is a blanket name that unites accessing values and substituting values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within these use-cases, there is a myriad of conditional behaviours and they are decided based on the kind of parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There isn't much expansion going on. Word "expanded" is simply an arcane way to say "reduced to a value".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start from the beginning. A parameter in bash is either a variable (like &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt;), a positional "argument" parameter (like &lt;code&gt;$1&lt;/code&gt;), or a special parameter (like &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Expansion" is the process of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_strategy_(lambda_calculus)"&gt;reduction&lt;/a&gt; of parameters to values. Variables expand in the way one would expect from variables.&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Special-Parameters.html"&gt;Special parameters&lt;/a&gt;, however, can have context-dependent expansions. Expansions have special syntaxes to tack on additional computations like string substitution, length calculation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's use the following variable as an example: &lt;code&gt;x="a.b.c"&lt;/code&gt;. Here is a list of the most often used parameter expansions, according to us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stripping. Use-case: get a file extension or remove a file extension.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;${x%.*} ≡ a.b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;${x%%.*} ≡ a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;${x#*.} ≡ b.c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;${x##*.} ≡ c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String replacement. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;${x/./\!} ≡ a!b.c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;${x//./\!} ≡ a!b!c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array enumeration with &lt;code&gt;IFS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[@]&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;IFS="."; for v in ${x[@]}; do echo -n "($v)"; done ≡ (a)(b)(c)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also construct arrays with a "compound assignment":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
x=(a b c)
for v in ${x[@]}; do 
    echo -n "($v)"
done

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IFS manipulation is not normally needed. If you're changing the splitting context, you should see if there is another way. You might be falling victim to the &lt;a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem"&gt;XY problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This tutorial should provide good-enough techniques to quickly and effectively implement shell scripts that do what you want them to. Quote your variables, fail fast, make backups to recover from destructive changes, don't use too many "advanced features" since they are error-prone, and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We leave you with some shell scripts we wrote that push the boundaries of what shell should be used to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/usr-local-bin/blob/master/chess"&gt;A chess clock made in bash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejonn/shmux/tree/master/item/shmux"&gt;A script I use daily: spawn or reattach to given project's &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; session&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/issues-legacy/blob/master/issues#L5-L15"&gt;Auto-detect canonical path to the script and eval modules residing in &lt;code&gt;include/&lt;/code&gt; directory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/issues-legacy/blob/master/include/bye.sh"&gt;Terminate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/issues-legacy/blob/master/issues#L3"&gt;process tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/manpages/issues-legacy/blob/master/include/debug.sh"&gt;printing debug output&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there will be community interest, we will take some time to cover extensible shell scripting in Haskell with Turtle. As usual, reach out to us on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doma_dev"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or in the comments on &lt;a href="https://dev.to/doma"&gt;Dev.to&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doma-dev.medium.com/"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Interview Question #31: Big or small</title>
      <author>Coderslang: Become a Software Engineer</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:24:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/coderslang/javascript-interview-question-31-big-or-small-pje</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/coderslang/javascript-interview-question-31-big-or-small-pje</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QlQFyvgQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://learn.coderslang.com/js-test-31.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QlQFyvgQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://learn.coderslang.com/js-test-31.png" alt="js-test-31"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's the output?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there’s an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement and it’s condition &lt;code&gt;Math.max() &amp;gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; is all we need to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your first guess was that &lt;code&gt;Math.max()&lt;/code&gt; should return some big number that’s for sure bigger than &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then you’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript &lt;code&gt;Math.max()&lt;/code&gt; takes a variable number of arguments and returns the biggest one. The comparison starts at the very bottom, which in JS is &lt;code&gt;-Infinity&lt;/code&gt; because it’s smaller than all other numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why if no arguments are provided to the &lt;code&gt;Math.max()&lt;/code&gt;, it will return &lt;code&gt;-Infinity&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;code&gt;-Infinity&lt;/code&gt; is smaller than &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll go into the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; branch of the conditional statement.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANSWER&lt;/strong&gt;: string &lt;code&gt;ZERO!&lt;/code&gt; will be logged to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Wizard of Oz in CSS</title>
      <author>Alvaro Montoro</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:21:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/the-wizard-of-oz-in-css-5g7c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/the-wizard-of-oz-in-css-5g7c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the books I have read recently. So I decided to draw the story's main characters in a minimalist/vectorial way, just using 8 colors, HTML, and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/full/LYxLxpG"&gt;demo on Codepen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/embed/LYxLxpG?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to keep the drawing simple and to the minimum, so each character only has four sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cowardly Lion&lt;/strong&gt;: mane, face, ears, and nose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dorothy&lt;/strong&gt;: face, hair, dress, and hair bows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scarecrow&lt;/strong&gt;: hat, face, necktie, and straw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tin Woodman&lt;/strong&gt;: hat, face, jaw, and bowtie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawings are done with &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path"&gt;&lt;code&gt;clip-path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;code&gt;polygon()&lt;/code&gt; function. So the process was a little bit like &lt;em&gt;carving&lt;/em&gt; from a square to the desired shape... which was a small challenge considering I didn't use any editing software to generate them—all by hand (watch the &lt;a href=""&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* Cowardly Lion's mane */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.lion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.mane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;--orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;polygon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;73%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;87%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;85%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;70%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;65%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;93%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;60%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;98%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;55%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;45%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="m"&gt;40%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;98%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;35%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;93%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;13%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;27%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8%&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
Example of CSS code from the drawing&lt;br&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;A small animation completes the drawing: &lt;strong&gt;moving the mouse over each character will display what they want to ask the wizard&lt;/strong&gt;: courage (a star medal), going home (a house), a brain, and a heart, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result looks nice. Although I must admit that Dorothy resembles the girl from Wendy's and the Scarecrow, a rocket taking off... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I changed the drawing to make it a little more interactive by replacing the container &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with links to each of the actors who played the character. &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro/pen/eYgeRxQ"&gt;You can see that version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the whole drawing process took around an hour and a half. Here's a video of how it went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnvJrrX8uuM"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do you workout son!? 🧐 🏋️</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi comrades! 💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you now that sitting work isn't good enough for your body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If speaking of me, my training program in past was similar to this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/KXlcrakfMPwwU/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/KXlcrakfMPwwU/giphy.gif" alt="mr.Bean Workout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I found out that it's not the best program 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like go to the gym and I solved to find something for home training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been training for Insanity by Shoun T. This program gave me a very big endurance 🏃‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I found App - Centr by Chris Hemsworth. Now I'm training by this program 🏋️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you usually maintain your health? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/MP1kygLQzjCve/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/MP1kygLQzjCve/giphy.gif" alt="Tell Me"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elaborating Code Journey From Developers to Testers (Code Analysis Tools For Java)</title>
      <author>Priyanshi Sharma</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 12:59:57 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/priyanshi_sharma/elaborating-code-journey-from-developers-to-testers-code-analysis-tools-for-java-32dh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A-Na6QF2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o9ne0jtvjxekjag6d646.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A-Na6QF2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o9ne0jtvjxekjag6d646.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering projects on time has always been stressful in the software industry. Often, the software doesn’t work due to bugs, the problem in code quality, or other vulnerabilities causing delays continuously. Why do such problems occur, you may ask. While consistently working on the project, developers majorly concentrate on logic and fundamentals to reach the final goals. However, while doing so, some of the bugs and errors remain hidden until the deployment of the code. At the time of code execution, these issues suddenly come into view and lead to a long process of debugging and fixing the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver the product on time to the clients, developers use some tools to monitor and analyze the source code. Code analysis can be performed in one of the two ways, i.e. static analysis and dynamic analysis. Today, we will understand the code analysis tools for Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is code analysis, why it is important to monitor code, and which tools does the developer use? Let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-code-analysis-for-java-amp-why-is-it-important"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/static-code-analysis-tools-for-java"&gt;What is Code Analysis For Java &amp;amp; Why is it Important?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code analysis is a method of analyzing and debugging the source code of the program before actually executing it. However, code analysis is not only limited to static analysis, it goes far beyond that. So, in this article, we will discuss the entire journey of developers till the project reaches the quality analysts/tester for further testing and analysis of the code. Simply, you can think of code analysis as a process that guides developers in maintaining a healthy codebase with best practices by reducing manual effort and increasing the quality while developing the software for the clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what actually is the programmer’s journey to write quality code? Let’s check it out in detail here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Linting:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially, a developer starts to test their code using linting tools. These tools help in analyzing source code syntactically and detecting potential bugs, stylistic errors, and invalid constructs.

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unit Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; In unit testing, developers test individual units or components of code. It is performed to check that each unit is working expectedly. Let’s say, you are a developer who needs to add new features to the project. To add this feature, you will have to change the old source code (where you have no idea how many other codes are dependent on). After successfully updating the code for the new feature, you see that this latest feature designed by you is working properly, but what you don’t know is the number of other dependent features of the project that has failed to work. However, with the help of unit testing, if you make any changes in the old code, it will instantly show you other lines of code that need fixing, such a practice will save your efforts, improve the development speed and reduce the chances of creating new bugs. 

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Code Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Code coverage is one of the white box testings that helps in finding the area of the program not covered by a set of test cases. It helps in measuring the efficiency of test implementation. It is impractical to use breakpoints or step through a program in the debugger to monitor which statements have been executed as you have so many statements in your program. Code coverage is a measure of the degree to which your program source code has been executed, and unless you can prove that your tests have been performed over all of the code in your program, those tests might be missing defects. Some of the common coverage reports that one can acquire using a code coverage tool include statement coverage, condition coverage, branch coverage, and function coverage. 

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Inspection:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous inspection refers to the automated analysis of the source code for potential bugs, coding standard breaches, lack of unit testing, replication of code, a bad distribution of complexity, and highly complex design at the architectural level. While using tools for continuous inspection in IDE, you will get automated build scripts, that will break the build (the method of changing source code files into standalone software artefact that can be run on a server or computer) if the test coverage goes below 80% or there are some severe issues. In such cases where the build fails, as a stakeholder, you will get an instant notification to fix the build immediately. 

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability and Compliance Assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Vulnerability and compliance testing is a software testing technique that evaluates the number of risks involved in the system. These risks could be anything from injection flaws (enabling user to gain backend access) to broken authentication (allowing passwords, keys, or tokens access), from exposure of sensitive data to XML External Entities (providing access to internal data via external entities), and broken access control to security misconfiguration. Using tools for vulnerability and compliance assessment can help developers in gaining complete reports on such issues so that they can fix them.

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Integration &amp;amp; Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):&lt;/strong&gt; While working on a project, developers continuously need to add new lines of code and features. CI/CD removes the gaps between deployment/operation activities and teams by offering automation in building, testing, and deployment of the code. Let’s assume, we have multiple developers who are working on the same project. Each of them has its feature or bug-fix to work upon while contributing to the project. As they complete the code it eventually gets pushed to the code repository that stores all the different versions of the codes for a feature. From here a build is created for testing the code and validating if it’s creating a bug or not. Once the tests are completed and the build turns out to be successful, the new version of the code is deployed making it available for the users. This complete process of CI/CD can be performed using several different tools that we will discuss later. 

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-open-source-code-analysis-tools-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.decipherzone.com/blog-detail/code-analysis-tools-java"&gt;Which Open Source Code Analysis Tools To Use?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the variety of tools available out there for code analysis, it becomes difficult to opt for the one that suits your requirements. So, for each step that a developer takes for thorough code analysis, here is the list of open-source code analysis tools to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-sonarlint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. SonarLint&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linting is the first step in the static code analysis for every programming language. In Java, developers mostly use Sonarlint, an open-source IDE plugin that is available for IntelliJ and Eclipse. It helps in automating the analysis of source code for formatting or programmatic errors. With the help of Sonarlint, a programmer can easily reduce stylistic errors while enhancing the quality of the code. It enables developers to address potential vulnerabilities and bugs before their commitment to the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-junit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2. JUnit&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java developers. It is essential for test unit development and is also considered an instance of X unit architecture. It is used for testing the small chunks of code or a unit by creating a path, function, or method. It promotes the idea of a test first and caught late. It is the most commonly used framework for developers’ IDEs. JUnitEE testing framework allows testing the code within the server’s container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-jacoco"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;3. JaCoCo&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JaCoCo or Java Code Coverage is being used by the developers to check the code coverage of the program. Code coverage is the percentage of code that is covered by automated testing. It is a form of white box testing that finds the areas of the program that does not have a set of test cases. It helps in analyzing the number of codes that we have already tested and what we haven’t covered. With the help of JaCoCo, developers can identify the efficiency of the test implementation, so that they can write additional test code and execute them. Apart from JaCoCo, we have other tools that can be used to check code coverage, like Cobertura and JTest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-pmd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;4. PMD&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMD is an open-source static code analysis tool for Java that identifies the issues present in the application code. It contains an in-built set of rules and supports the capacity to write custom code. It helps in detecting common programming errors such as empty catch blocks, unused variables, unnecessary object creation, duplicate code, empty logical statements, possible bugs, and so on. It supports JDeveloper, jEdit, Intellij IDEA, Maven, Jenkins, Eclipse, JBuilder, and SonarQube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-sonarqube"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;5. SonarQube&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SonarQube is an open-source code analysis tool developed by SonarSource. It guides developers in continuous analysis of code quality to provide automated reviews whenever it detects bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. It is sort of a dashboard that offers reports on coding standards, unit tests, duplicated codes, code complexity, bugs, vulnerabilities, and comments. It can easily be integrated with MSBuild, Maven, Ant, Jenkins, Hudson, and other continuous integration tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-qualys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;6. Qualys&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualys is the first company to offer cloud-based vulnerability and compliance management solutions. To continuously detect and protect software from attacks, it is the perfect solution to opt for. It allows you to scan the system from one console anytime as required. With the help of Qualys, one can do a thorough analysis and then create custom reports accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-jenkins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;7. Jenkins&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins is a free automation server that assists in automating some development parts including building, testing, and deploying. It facilitates continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. With hundreds of plugins, Jenkins can practically integrate any tool in the CI/CD toolchain. Moreover, Jenkins easily distributes work across different machines to make the process of building, testing and deploying faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every client and developer wants a high-quality Java code for the project that can be delivered in tight deadlines and short sprints. With the help of these code analysis tools for Java integrations, developers can be confident that inadvertent errors will not make their way into the release while disturbing the flow of the code, while clients can get what they need efficiently. So if you are a business owner who wants to develop a high-quality software or web app for your brand, then you can contact us for consultations or hire developers with extensive experience and knowledge in this field. On the other hand, if you are a programmer who gets stuck in the coding execution, try these tools and enhance your skills effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 reasons why Twitter is better than LinkedIn for finding work</title>
      <author>Andrew Baisden</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 12:29:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/10-reasons-why-twitter-is-better-than-linkedin-for-finding-work-gbk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/10-reasons-why-twitter-is-better-than-linkedin-for-finding-work-gbk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is a great social network for finding work. Many companies use it for hiring and it is very easy to find a recruiter. However it is not the only social network out there which you can use for finding your next job. Here are 10 reasons why Twitter is better than LinkedIn for finding work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-it-is-more-casual"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. It is more casual
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main differences between the two platforms is that Twitter feels more fun and casual whereas LinkedIn is more formal and business orientated. People tend to be themselves when in a more casual scene it is easier to express yourself and meet people. On LinkedIn it has more of a formal strict feel to it and many job seekers get harassing and spam messages from recruiters and some companies which makes the experience feel negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-developers-are-more-open-to-connecting-with-their-peers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Developers are more open to connecting with their peers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter it feels far more natural to follow other developers who usually follow you back. Almost everyone is open to it regardless if you know them in real life or not. However the same rules don't always apply when using LinkedIn. Firstly you have to send a connection request which the person you are trying to connect with could easily refuse. So in this sense the platform is more closed than it is open like Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-less-recruiters-more-companies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Less recruiters more companies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are recruiters on Twitter however their main playground is LinkedIn that is where they do most of their work. On Twitter you are more likely to engage with companies who see your work or people who work for those companies. Thats an easy way to make a new connection because Twitter can feel more like a public journal of your current developer journey. Whereas on LinkedIn it feels more like you are trying to force your CV into someone's face in the hope that it gets you an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-engagement-is-much-higher"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Engagement is much higher
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are more likely to get noticed on Twitter than you are on LinkedIn. Tweets generally get significantly higher likes because the platform is designed to be more personal and fun. People also tend to spend more time on Twitter because the experience is more enjoyable and they have friends on there. Compared to LinkedIn which feels like a tool specifically designed for work. How many people feel excited to spend hours on LinkedIn all day? Most of the conversations are business focused and there is a lot of spam from recruiters hitting send all and sending you a generic job description. To companies that want you to sign up to their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-twitter-spaces-is-awesome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Twitter Spaces is awesome!!!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter Spaces is an audio only chat room where you are in a room with other users. You can talk about anything you want and it is one of the best ways to engage and connect with your followers. I have been using it for a few months now and the experience is extremely positive. It is like live radio and a conference call all in one. I have been in Twitter Spaces rooms where they talk about the best ways for finding work, different technical stacks and better ways on promoting yourself. It is like getting insider secrets that you can use to boost your career prospects. The casual feel of the rooms is very inviting too. This is a feature which LinkedIn currently does not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-it-is-a-good-way-to-gauge-personality-and-culture-fit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. It is a good way to gauge personality and culture fit
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter you are free to express yourself anyway you want. So the tweets that you do can be a good indication of what your personality is like. In contrast people tend to be more serious and business minded on LinkedIn so they are likely to say things in a more formal manner that is more appropriate for a cover letter or resume. On LinkedIn when you look at a profile you are only looking at someones past experience in most cases. Whereas if you look at Twitter you could see what projects they are currently working on and the type of learning they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-it-is-a-better-learning-tool"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. It is a better learning tool
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that LinkedIn Learning exists but hear me out. LinkedIn Learning is only free as a 1 month trial after that you need to pay for it. When compared to what's on offer with Twitter it can't really compete. There are thousands of developers using Twitter and many of them share FREE resources each day as well as giving their own insights into learning strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-blogging-opens-up-doors-to-new-opportunities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Blogging opens up doors to new opportunities
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another area where Twitter wins. Because the platform feels more casual people use it for writing articles and blogging. I have been doing this for over 1 year and have grown my network on different platforms. It has even opened up doors to a few freelance jobs as a technical writer. The content you put on Twitter can really help you to grow as a developer. Sure you can post the same content on LinkedIn but we go back to the topic of engagement. The audience is usually not as big and most people tend to have more recruiters as connections than developers so the content you write might not be as applicable for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-less-ghosting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Less ghosting
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connections that you have on Twitter feel more real in my opinion. That's because it is easier to connect with people as you have a common interest and it is socially acceptable to talk about any topic. The same can't be said of LinkedIn where it feels like everyone you connect with is just a business partner. The biggest reason for this is that you are typically going to be connecting with recruiters and they use the platform for work and not socialising. So the topics of conversation are more strict and business focused. Because of this it is hard to form strong connections with people and if you are unsuccessful with a few interviews then you become forgotten and the recruiter moves onto someone else. Twitter feels more supportive as you are going through the same problems other developers have so instead of losing connections you gain them for being more authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-twitter-has-a-more-active-community"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Twitter has a more active community
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has about 335 million monthly active users whereas LinkedIn has 294 million monthly active users. While the difference is not hugely dissimilar it can make a difference. In general people tend to spend far more time on Twitter than they do with LinkedIn which means you have a much higher chance of someone responding or noticing something that you said. You are also likely to see much more posts on Twitter and likely more profile views as well. You also have the added bonus of growing your developer network at a much faster rate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope that you enjoyed reading this article and learned something from it. As a content creator and technical writer I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping other people reach their goals. Let's connect on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbaisden"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-baisden/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/andrewbaisden"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will just leave you one last easter egg 🥚. These are lyrics from a song lets see if you can find it 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"If we'll be united&lt;br&gt;
We're stronger together&lt;br&gt;
We always have the high hope&lt;br&gt;
Not all for one but one for all"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace ✌️&lt;/p&gt;
