      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 days, 5 countries, 2 conferences - Dealing with anxiety and networking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello beautiful people, in this article I’ll describe my last 8 days traveling in Europe and attending as a speaker 2 tech conferences. While we progress I'll share what I learned during these days (tech and non-tech news/advice) as well as some tips about networking and being comfortable around new people (which is something I always struggle with, but I am making my best to improve it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. I used to travel a lot in conferences all over the world, but then covid happened and I stopped! Maybe the old followers/readers, already know that, but as I usually say, I have 2 passions: my job and traveling. So when these 2 things can be combined you can bet I am a happy girl 😊&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Also, I am fully vaccinated and I take seriously all the health regulations. It's not only about my well-being but also about the people around me. I would never jeopardize their health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the journey begin...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you are bored to read, watch the  &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VBlnjW2Lvgs"&gt;vlog&lt;/a&gt; 😉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=VBlnjW2Lvgs"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H7RoO12D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://img.youtube.com/vi/VBlnjW2Lvgs/0.jpg" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-1-monday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 1 - Monday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E2%9C%88-greece-germany-and-croatia"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✈ Greece, Germany and Croatia
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up so excited for my journey, everything was ready and planned. I had made my preparation through the weekend (airplane check-in, suitcases, and even some of Monday's work), my flight wasn't until midday so I had some time to work and be productive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The socializing part started as soon as I arrived at the airport. There was an issue with the online check-in so I had to actually speak to a human for my tickets 😳. I know, I know, for some of you that wouldn't be an issue, or it could even be your pleasure, but I have some anxiety issues even on the smallest things...&lt;br&gt;
I asked the man in the check-in "do you need to see my vaccine ce ce cert certif certification?" I was rumbling so hard, I couldn't prefer the word certification in my own language (certification = πιστοποιητικό), the man laugh but he started to chat with me about other things and that actually made me feel better... Maybe we were chatting for about 7-10' until a huge waiting line had created... (oops, sorry travelers 😊). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SLMuZQoh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725655192/ajyC7YbMS.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SLMuZQoh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725655192/ajyC7YbMS.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210906_144042.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was Munich (Germany 🇩🇪) and right after there Zadar (Croatia 🇭🇷). From Zadar, a taxi driver picked me up and drove me to the hotel. The taxi driver didn't know English so we couldn't communicate... As you can probably understand that was not an issue for me😏. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sx83tLuM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725642342/SJzTAf_zK.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sx83tLuM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725642342/SJzTAf_zK.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210907_091713.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel was located in an area outside of Zadar and it was one of the best luxurious hotels I have ever been to (more about that later). It was about 7 pm when I took a shower and went alone for a dinner at the hotel's restaurant. As I started to eat a young smiley man approached me, "hi, are you also a speaker? are you this girl?" (pointing at my photo on the conference's website) as I knot my head positively the young man showed his photo on the website too, introduced himself and asked me if he could join me. My heart started to beat faster, not because I didn't like the man, but because, you know, I had to speak with another human😳. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ih8tCGe7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725711690/eeDLMfiN9.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ih8tCGe7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725711690/eeDLMfiN9.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210906_205510.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually spent the next few hours with this person. He was just one year older than me, a CEO of a company, and a creator of a js framework (let's keep some anonymity, and not get into more details, at least for now). 😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, I went to my room, worked for a few more hours, and went for sleeping. 😴 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1st day's thoughts💭 : Could humans be actually pleasant?! The guy from the airport check-in made me feel comfortable and the guy from the dinner kept me company and actually became my companion for the next days!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-2-tuesday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 2: Tuesday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conference-infobip-shift-day-1-of-2-the-day-of-my-talk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conference: &lt;a href="https://shift.infobip.com/"&gt;Infobip Shift&lt;/a&gt; - Day 1 of 2 - The day of my talk
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day started with a nice breakfast near the hotel's pool 🏊 🥐 (I'm telling you dear readers, the hotel was amazing!). &lt;br&gt;
I stayed in my room working until midday when it was time to call an uber and reach the conference's location. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HTtO6oIA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725813953/vkqv8CHsX.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HTtO6oIA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725813953/vkqv8CHsX.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210907_085012.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended several people's talks and gained some valuable knowledge of tech and coding.&lt;br&gt;
I also gave my talk which was about UX and UI. Everything went great and according to the plan. Weirdly enough when I'm presenting I'm not nervous (I have a trick for that, maybe I could share it on another article... 😊, let me know if you are interested in how to speak to an audience/giving a presentation and not getting a panic attack!! 😁 ) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i_7TZ0f1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725824879/dS6CdjFF5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i_7TZ0f1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631725824879/dS6CdjFF5.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210907_150525.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the venue, I met the dinner-guy who introduced me to his friends/speakers and we became a nice "little" nerd 🤓 and IT gang!! How cool, right?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had checked the conference's website and I knew who were the people that I definitely wanted to meet. These were people like Gift, Ekene, Sébastien, Eduardo, Kent, Nikolas, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--977xUuAK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727137745/t5wqO0BV6.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--977xUuAK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727137745/t5wqO0BV6.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210907_143303.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those people I was following on social media or I was familiar with their work. Other people seemed very interesting, I loved their talk so I definitely wanted to meet them. As I was surrounded with my cool IT gang it was easier to meet people, they could introduce me to others and if they also didn't know the "others", they were not as anxious as I was (hello extrovert people), so they would just go and speak and I would follow (that's a pretty good approach for meeting new people!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2nd day's thoughts💭: Humans have started to seem less terrifying... They like to talk, they like to make jokes and they even want to help you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HTYi6OCk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727207609/CJ44LH1Bn.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HTYi6OCk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727207609/CJ44LH1Bn.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210907_200707.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the conference, I went back to the hotel, worked for a few hours and at night I went for dinner 🍲 in a nice location with my nerd IT gang and we even went for an after-party (come on dear introvert friends, you have to applause me here 👏 👏, I went for both dinner + after party 🎉). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-3-wednesday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 3: Wednesday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conference-infobip-shift-day-2-of-2-networking-and-meetings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conference: &lt;a href="https://shift.infobip.com/"&gt;Infobip Shift&lt;/a&gt; - Day 2 of 2 - Networking and meetings
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started with a nice chilled breakfast ☕ near the pool and continued with work. I only went to the conference venue in the afternoon when I was done with work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was time for meetings and networking once again😔. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1the-porche-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.The Porche experience 🚙
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with something cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--18SdHm-W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727257959/aGAdk_3_O.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--18SdHm-W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727257959/aGAdk_3_O.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210908_173702.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Porche&lt;/strong&gt; was one of the sponsors and they wanted a woman in tech to represent them. They liked my talk and my presence and they asked me for some possible collaborations. They took some professional photos with the cars and me (I am waiting for the official photos too... As soon as I get them I’ll share them on Instagram 📸), and they had a professional driver who took me on a fast ride (I can't even describe how insanely beautiful the car and the ride were). For those of you thinking "but where can you drive/run a fast car like Porche safely?", I have an answer: the event was held in Zadar's biggest sports arena. The arena had also a huge parking which was allocated by Porche. Each time only a handful of people could visit at the same time the parking due to safety reasons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-being-approached-by-attendees"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Being approached by attendees
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people approached me as they had some questions and queries around my UX and UI talk or they would be interested in potential collaborations. That went well... I only messed up in the end with some emails and phone numbers🤣. See, I m not good with names...  And that resulted in sending some messages to the wrong people on WhatsApp!! But I guess these things happen, right?! Or is it only me? (Please say it is not only me, it will make me feel terrible, no kidding😕.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-the-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. The interview
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not uncommon in a conference to be asked by the organizers to take part in a video that will be used mainly for promoting purposes in their current or upcoming events. Usually, there is someone who will make a few simple questions (hence I call this part "the interview") around the conference and will record the speaker's answers. On the 1st day of the conference the organizer asked me to take part in the video, I said "yes" but then..."hello darkness my old friend" I could not do it... My shyness had returned... So I said "no". &lt;br&gt;
But...the 2nd day, as I was sitting with the cool nerd IT gang and I could watch them doing the interview I decided to give it a chance (that was a nice win 🏆 for my little introvert self), everything went fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-the-potential-collaboration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. The potential collaboration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is work-related I won't get into details. The main point is that I had an online meeting with an "x company" and as we were discussing we realized that on of their developers and I would be at the same conference so now it would be a nice opportunity to meet in real life and discuss some business! That's how I met a fellow developer 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-the-other-speaker-for-the-other-conference"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. The other speaker, for the other conference
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, in the upcoming days I was about to hit another conference in another country. The organizer from the other conference told me about this guy who would be in Croatia and then in Ukraine too (we would be in the same conferences), so I had to meet him! But you know, I'm introvert and shy... How would I do that... At first, I didn't even know who he was... &lt;br&gt;
At the second day of dinner, I asked my cool yet nerdy IT gang if they knew him. Long story short, they found him for me and even the dinner-guy made the introduction as I was too scared for that...&lt;br&gt;
But guess what, it went well! The other-conference-guy was super nice and friendly! And &lt;strong&gt;he's also a writer here at Hashnode&lt;/strong&gt;! 😁 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I had a lovely night with good company 🍻 ! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-4-thursday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 4:  Thursday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#croatia-to-austria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Croatia to Austria 🇦🇹
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day started in the same way. Breakfast 🥐 and work. Later that day I would catch my flight to Vienna, Austria. I reached Vienna and stayed one day there as there was no direct flight to Odesa, Ukraine which was the 2nd conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SLSyCgHz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727407999/OgasdTtnM.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SLSyCgHz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727407999/OgasdTtnM.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210909_171719.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No networking stories this time. I quickly arrived at the hotel. There, I only talked with the hotel receptionist and the host of the hotel's restaurant. &lt;br&gt;
My evening ended with working out and work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-5-friday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 5: Friday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#austria-to-ukraine"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Austria to Ukraine 🇺🇦
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, another flight 🛬 ! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast in the hotel, a few hours of work, and catching up on a flight!! &lt;br&gt;
This time I landed in Odesa-Ukraine for the conference of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pyconodessa.com/en/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; Odesa&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fBKhl51a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727601014/djJ6d8liM.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fBKhl51a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727601014/djJ6d8liM.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210910_180000.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-german-organizer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The "German" organizer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shall we move on with another &lt;strong&gt;networking story&lt;/strong&gt;?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you wonder how a girl from Greece, working occasionally with Javascript and Design, working full time as a community manager at Hashnode, would end up in a Python conference in a little city in Ukraine? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are 2 points connected to each other. The 1st one is that I simply applied to speak to the conference as I believe my talk is equally important for all kinds of developers... (and that's usually what all speakers do, they apply to conferences...). The 2nd one (and usually the hardest one) is to get an invitation... But... A beautiful sunny morning I received a Twitter DM from an organizer I met a few years ago in Munich, Germany telling me that he is a co-organizer for this conference too and he'd love to have me as a speaker. I specified to him once again that my talk is not related to Python but it would be my pleasure. And just like that, I was in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I have an invitation from the organizer if he didn't know me? I honestly don't know... But I have a suspicion that our old meeting helped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-go-to-the-accommodation-and-the-venue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's go to the accommodation and the venue
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S5PcCBqa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727877438/wk60yWu7b.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--S5PcCBqa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727877438/wk60yWu7b.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210912_165928.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference venue and the accommodation were in the same location. This is very convenient for the speakers... The only issue was that the location was a bit outside of Odesa and not many taxis were willing to drive you... Thankfully another organizer came and picked me up 😊, he drove me to the venue where I met once again the "German organizer". He introduced me to some lovely girls and fellow speakers (who later became my friends). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a few hours to relax and then it was time for dinner and drinks in the city center! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-6-saturday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 6: Saturday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conference-pycon-odessa-day-1-of-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conference: PyCon Odessa - Day 1 of 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--90Pt7G4Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727921506/3y4UU7GR1.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--90Pt7G4Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727921506/3y4UU7GR1.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210911_103533.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, I m sure you know the drill. Breakfast 🥐 and work! You may be thinking "But Elef, it was Saturday did you have to work?!" and the answer is no... But the thing is I hadn't finished Friday's work and I also wanted to prepare some stuff for Monday that I knew I would be traveling and I wouldn't be able to do.&lt;br&gt;
This time my breakfast wasn't near a pool or at a fancy hotel restaurant but at a terrace with a view of the ocean and the city!&lt;br&gt;
After work, I met my cool gang, a few new speakers and started to attending talks. In the evening, we had a lovely dinner with the crew and the attendees in an open space and we talked about tech and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-7-sunday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 7: Sunday
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conference-pycon-odessa-day-2-of-2-the-day-of-my-talk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conference: PyCon Odessa - Day 2 of 2 - The day of my talk
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CRvtgCtH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727993460/1l1-ldOy7.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CRvtgCtH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631727993460/1l1-ldOy7.jpeg" alt="IMG-20210913-WA0024.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day started differently... It started with yoga! The speakers and the attendees got together on the building's terrace where we met the yoga instructor and had a lovely short session with her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WwsXnS4I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631728018621/IZglUe7ol.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WwsXnS4I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631728018621/IZglUe7ol.jpeg" alt="IMG-20210913-WA0022.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued with talks, and after lunchtime, it was my turn! I gave once again a talk about UX and UI. I was pleased with it as many people approached me asking for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this was the second and last day people were more relaxed and the conference ended up earlier than the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pPbL2-J_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631728040547/wkF4JcdWx.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pPbL2-J_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631728040547/wkF4JcdWx.jpeg" alt="IMG-20210913-WA0023.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a closing party for the organizers and the speakers, we booked ourselves a yacht ⛵ for the afternoon/evening. It was my first time sailing and having so much fun with people that I literally met a couple of days before. Everyone was welcoming and chilled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last day's thoughts💭: Actually those humans who called them shelves developers and advocates are... quite fantastic!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#day-8-monday-back-home"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Day 8: Monday - Back home 🏠
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ukraine-to-germany-to-greece"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ukraine to Germany to Greece 🇬🇷
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I woke up ☀ , I found the organizers who helped me to find a taxi and get to the airport. At the airport's cafeteria, I did my daily stand-up meeting with the Hashnode team, worked for a few hours, and took my first flight to Berlin. That flight was 2h 30min so I started writing this article! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Berlin, I had a long layover AND a delay on my flight which actually gave me the time to finish all my work, prepare for the next day, and of course attend Hashnode's Bootcamp! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last flight from Berlin to Greece I kept writing this article and  I even managed to finish it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(After writing an article I need some time to review and edit it... Plus in this case, add some photos and edit a video. So although the article was finished on Monday it was published on Thursday.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#general-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  General thoughts 💭
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#could-i-have-created-more-connectionsopportunities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Could I have created more connections/opportunities?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course! You can find opportunities everywhere you just have to know where to look for and be willing to take your risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I have met more people? Yes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, I'm glad that I managed to pull this trip of... As a shy, introvert person I'm glad with my progress! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--01abjwsV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631728170898/ydw0XSicB.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--01abjwsV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1631728170898/ydw0XSicB.jpeg" alt="IMG_20210912_190033.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thank-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thank you... 🙏
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I'd like to thank:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashnode for giving me the opportunity to work in a flexible schedule. &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Working In Open Source</title>
      <author>DerekJxy</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/derekjxy/working-in-open-source-554l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/derekjxy/working-in-open-source-554l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In order to&lt;/strong&gt; make our code of &lt;strong&gt;Static Site Generator better&lt;/strong&gt;, we are required to share our code to a &lt;strong&gt;partner&lt;/strong&gt; and try to find out some &lt;em&gt;issues&lt;/em&gt; that can make their original code &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt;. And this is the &lt;strong&gt;main point&lt;/strong&gt; that we have &lt;strong&gt;Lab 1&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;OSD600&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partner I found was &lt;strong&gt;Kunwarvir Dhillon&lt;/strong&gt;. I had never met my partner Kunwarvir Dhillon before. And we just team up &lt;strong&gt;randomly&lt;/strong&gt;. However, although we haven't met each other before, &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; both treat this sharing code behavior &lt;strong&gt;seriously&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
After communicated with &lt;em&gt;Kunwarvir Dhillon&lt;/em&gt;, we both started to check our each other's code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interesting-stuff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interesting Stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;first time&lt;/strong&gt; that I tried to improve other's code by &lt;em&gt;my own knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. I've never thought that I can help people improve their code &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I always think that what I known are &lt;strong&gt;limited and basic&lt;/strong&gt;. However, through this &lt;strong&gt;Lab 1&lt;/strong&gt;, sharing code with my partner, &lt;em&gt;I learned something&lt;/em&gt;. I learned that there are &lt;strong&gt;no perfect code ever&lt;/strong&gt;, even some beginners can help those experienced programers improve their code. &lt;strong&gt;I can help people improve their code as well!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honestly&lt;/strong&gt;, the first time I got my partner Kunwarvir Dhillon's code, I was &lt;em&gt;soooo confused&lt;/em&gt;. I felt like there is &lt;strong&gt;no way&lt;/strong&gt; I can help them to &lt;strong&gt;improve their code&lt;/strong&gt; base on my knowledge even &lt;strong&gt;though&lt;/strong&gt; we built the code in the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; language -- &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;. And then I just told myself, &lt;em&gt;just break it down step by step&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;make it slow....&lt;/em&gt; And then I just followed the &lt;strong&gt;instruction&lt;/strong&gt; that our professor provided, and check the code &lt;em&gt;step by step&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt;, I &lt;strong&gt;found&lt;/strong&gt; a few issues that can help my partner &lt;strong&gt;improve&lt;/strong&gt; their code! That was &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; to me! And when it comes &lt;strong&gt;to the end&lt;/strong&gt; of the checking, I &lt;strong&gt;realized&lt;/strong&gt; that there are a lot of &lt;strong&gt;similar&lt;/strong&gt; code in our code! And I &lt;strong&gt;shouldn't&lt;/strong&gt; felt &lt;strong&gt;panic&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt; me in my partner's code. And that is they have a &lt;strong&gt;personal logo&lt;/strong&gt; when the user access their code. So whenever I run their code, it will have a &lt;em&gt;logo&lt;/em&gt; comes up like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o2bn4WEQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ogwzan4cqxl29774w60.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--o2bn4WEQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ogwzan4cqxl29774w60.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-some-issues-i-found-in-my-partners-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are some issues I found in my partner's code:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/dhillonks/cli-ssg/issues/1"&gt;Issue #1&lt;/a&gt; There are &lt;strong&gt;some defined variables that never used&lt;/strong&gt; in the code.
&lt;code&gt;const yargs = require("yargs");&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;const path = require("path");&lt;/code&gt;
These two variables are never used in the code, so I suggested my partner to remove them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/dhillonks/cli-ssg/issues/2"&gt;Issue #2&lt;/a&gt; There is a &lt;strong&gt;deletable statement&lt;/strong&gt; in the code. This statement can be deleted since the output path is set by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/dhillonks/cli-ssg/issues/3"&gt;Issue #3&lt;/a&gt; I found that the code my partner shared to me would generate a weird html file. What I mean &lt;strong&gt;"weird"&lt;/strong&gt; is they are trying to divide the article &lt;strong&gt;sentences by sentences&lt;/strong&gt;, but not &lt;strong&gt;paragraphs by paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt;. And then I suggested they write the code with my new code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/dhillonks/cli-ssg/issues/4"&gt;Issue #4&lt;/a&gt; Since I changed one line of code in my partner's code, they need to &lt;strong&gt;update another line of code as well&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-some-issues-my-partner-found-in-my-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are some issues my partner found in my code:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/1"&gt;Issue #1&lt;/a&gt; My Index Html is &lt;strong&gt;failed at (X)HTML5 validation&lt;/strong&gt;. There a space in the name of the HTML files that my code generated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/2"&gt;Issue #2&lt;/a&gt; My code would &lt;strong&gt;convert any type of files that the user input into a html file&lt;/strong&gt;, which is kind of a stupid feature of my code. We're only supposed to convert .txt file into a html file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/3"&gt;Issue #3&lt;/a&gt; My code would &lt;strong&gt;convert any type of files inside the folder that the user input into a html file&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a nonsense feature at all. My code should only supposed to work when it comes to .txt file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/4"&gt;Issue #4&lt;/a&gt; My code set that &lt;strong&gt;all the html files generated&lt;/strong&gt; will &lt;em&gt;place into&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;./dist&lt;/strong&gt; folder &lt;strong&gt;by default&lt;/strong&gt;. And it doesn't allow any other save path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/5"&gt;Issue #5&lt;/a&gt; I didn't have a &lt;strong&gt;clear declaration&lt;/strong&gt; in my &lt;strong&gt;README file&lt;/strong&gt;. And that made a &lt;strong&gt;misunderstanding&lt;/strong&gt; for my partner to access my code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;strong&gt;reviewing the issues&lt;/strong&gt; that my partner &lt;strong&gt;found&lt;/strong&gt; in my code. I realized that those are &lt;em&gt;simple and stupid mistakes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/1"&gt;Issue #1&lt;/a&gt;, the main reason that my &lt;strong&gt;Index Html is failed at (X)HTML5 validation&lt;/strong&gt; is my code generated some html files that with &lt;strong&gt;blank space&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;in their name&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore I update my code to generate html files that &lt;em&gt;without spaces&lt;/em&gt; by using the code &lt;code&gt;let validFname = fname.split(' ').join('');&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/2"&gt;Issue #2&lt;/a&gt;, I update my code to &lt;strong&gt;check the file type&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;fileType = argv.input.split('.').pop();&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;if(fileType == 'txt'){...}&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;before doing anything.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/3"&gt;Issue #3&lt;/a&gt;  I update my code to &lt;strong&gt;check the file type&lt;/strong&gt; inside the folder &lt;code&gt;fileType = file.split('.').pop();&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;if(fileType == 'txt'){...}&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;em&gt;convert the files to html files.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/issues/4"&gt;Issue #4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I'm not going to fix it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt; since it's an &lt;strong&gt;optional feature&lt;/strong&gt;. And there is &lt;em&gt;no harm&lt;/em&gt; to force the user save the output html files into a &lt;strong&gt;specific folder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And finally about&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG/Issues/5"&gt;issue #5&lt;/a&gt;, I updated my &lt;strong&gt;README file&lt;/strong&gt; so that any new users could &lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt; my code &lt;strong&gt;easily and correctly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know there are more issues in my code that need improvement. And I will try my best to make it better!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link to my repo: [&lt;a href="https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG"&gt;https://github.com/DerekJxy/My-First-SSG&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Masking phone numbers of couriers and	customers using a key-value store</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/imaximova/masking-phone-numbers-of-couriers-and-customers-using-the-key-value-store-27d9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has greatly affected delivery services, and they have become more in demand than ever before. As we know, a courier and a customer need each other's phone numbers to make a call and discuss the order details. &lt;strong&gt;But what about privacy?&lt;/strong&gt; Many delivery services already thought this question through, and each uses its own number masking solution. I, in turn, want to tell you how to mask phone numbers with the &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;Voximplant&lt;/a&gt; key-value store. So let’s get the party started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-it-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How it works
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create a scenario that allows a customer and a courier to make calls &lt;strong&gt;without knowing each other’s phone numbers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we’ll have only one so-called “neutral” phone number to call for both a courier and a customer. We’ll rent this number in the Voximplant panel. Then, we’ll create some data structure to connect a courier and a customer with each other by an order number (a &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt; if we are referring to a key-value store).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When calling a rented number, a caller enters their order number. If such an order exists in the database, our scenario checks the numbers attached to it. Then, if it identifies a phone number as a customer’s, we put them through to the courier responsible for the order, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a call from a courier to a customer looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cdS0d2tg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3d4kwcl4a770wypqulem.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cdS0d2tg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3d4kwcl4a770wypqulem.png" alt="Scheme"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t find the caller’s phone number in the database, we suggest they call again from the number they used when placing the order. Or we simply transfer them to an operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go straight to the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-you-need"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What you need
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Voximplant account which you can &lt;a href="https://manage.voximplant.com/auth/sign_up?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;create here&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/introduction/introduction_to_voximplant/basic_concepts?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;A Voximplant application with a scenario and a rule for this scenario&lt;/a&gt; (we’ll create it all together);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test phone numbers: a number rented from Voximplant, a courier’s, a customer’s, and an operator’s numbers. In the test version, we can omit an operator’s number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, log into your Voximplant account: &lt;a href="https://manage.voximplant.com/auth?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;manage.voximplant.com/auth&lt;/a&gt;. In the menu on the left, click &lt;a href="https://manage.voximplant.com/applications?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;Applications&lt;/a&gt; and then click &lt;strong&gt;Create application&lt;/strong&gt; in the upper right corner. Give it a name (for example, &lt;strong&gt;numberMasking&lt;/strong&gt;) and click &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a newly created app and go to &lt;strong&gt;Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;. Create a scenario by clicking the “+” button and name it &lt;strong&gt;kvs-scenario&lt;/strong&gt;. You will work with the code here, but everything is not quite ready yet; wait until we add code to the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Routing&lt;/strong&gt; tab and create a rule for the scenario. Leave the pattern (regular expression) “.*” as default. This way your rule will work for all phone numbers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ygrEwSIE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6iakgye8k0aon5ayzplb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ygrEwSIE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6iakgye8k0aon5ayzplb.png" alt="Rule"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rent a real phone number. To do that, go to the &lt;a href="https://manage.voximplant.com/numbers?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;Numbers&lt;/a&gt; section, select one and purchase it. This number will be called by a courier and a customer and will be displayed to them instead of their personal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that phone numbers are offered on-demand, except in countries where regulations require additional steps. You will find more information when renting a phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n-5HeFFe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mlgya5qkw1ldblterd49.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--n-5HeFFe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mlgya5qkw1ldblterd49.png" alt="Phone number purchase"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Voximplant, you can also rent test numbers to see how everything works. In our case, we need a real phone number to &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/howtos/calls/pstn?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;initiate a call from the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing is to attach the phone number to your application. To do that, open your application, go to the &lt;strong&gt;Numbers&lt;/strong&gt; → &lt;strong&gt;Available&lt;/strong&gt; and click &lt;strong&gt;Attach&lt;/strong&gt;. Here you can also attach your rule so it works for incoming calls, and all other rules are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! The structure is ready, now you just need to fill the key-value store and add some code to the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keyvalue-store"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key-value store
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario works properly if the key-value store isn’t empty. To fill it up, use the &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/httpapi?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;Voximplant Management API&lt;/a&gt;. I use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/voximplant/apiclient-python"&gt;Python API client&lt;/a&gt;. It requires Python 2.x or 3.x with pip and setuptools&amp;gt; = 18.5 installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to your project folder and install the SDK using &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install --user voximplant-apiclient&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a .py file and write the code that adds the order details to the key-value store. The &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/httpapi/keyvaluestorage#setkeyvalueitem"&gt;set_key_value_item&lt;/a&gt; will help you do that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;voximplant.apiclient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;VoximplantAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;VoximplantException&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"__main__"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;voxapi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;VoximplantAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"credentials.json"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# SetKeyValueItem example
&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;12345&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;VALUE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'{"courier": "12222222222", "client": 
"13333333333"}'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;APPLICATION_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;864000&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;voxapi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_key_value_item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;VALUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;APPLICATION_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;VoximplantException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error: {}"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can generate a &lt;strong&gt;credentials.json&lt;/strong&gt; file yourself when creating a service account in the &lt;a href="https://manage.voximplant.com/settings/service_accounts?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;Service accounts&lt;/a&gt; section. Don’t forget to choose a role that will allow you to call the &lt;code&gt;set_key_value_item&lt;/code&gt; method. &lt;strong&gt;Owner&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, will do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the &lt;strong&gt;APPLICATION_ID&lt;/strong&gt; in the address bar when navigating to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use a five-digit order number as a key (&lt;strong&gt;KEY&lt;/strong&gt;) and phone numbers as values. &lt;strong&gt;TTL&lt;/strong&gt; here is to specify the values' storage period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, run the file to save the order details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python kvs.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you no longer want a client and a courier to disturb each other, you can &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/httpapi/keyvaluestorage#delkeyvalueitem"&gt;delete&lt;/a&gt; the order details from the store. Find all the available key-value store methods in our documentation: &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/httpapi/keyvaluestorage?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;management API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/voxengine/applicationstorage?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;VoxEngine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scenario-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scenario code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;kvs-scenario&lt;/strong&gt; code is below, you can copy it as is. You just need to do one more thing – specify the number you rented in the Voximplant control panel as &lt;strong&gt;callid&lt;/strong&gt; in the form of  "10000000000":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Full scenario code
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ApplicationStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * @param {boolean} repeatAskForInput - whether the input request was repeated
 * @param longInputTimerId - timer for the absence of input
 * @param shortInputTimerId - timer for triggering the phrase about contacting an operator
 * @param {boolean} firstTimeout - indicator of the first timeout
 * @param {boolean} wrongPhone - indicator that the caller's number matches the number from storage
 * @param {boolean} inputRecieved - whether the input was received from the user
 * 
 */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeatAskForInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;longInputTimerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shortInputTimerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstTimeout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wrongPhone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputRecieved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;caller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;callee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;callid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;phone number rented in the panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;operator_call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;operatorNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;call_operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;order_number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;order_search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call_operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Operator is busy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;operatorUnavailable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hangup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendResultToDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Data to be sent to the database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HttpRequestOptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Content-Type: application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;postData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;httpRequestAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://voximplant.com/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VoiceList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Yandex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Neural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;en_US_alyss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlaybackFinished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlaybackFinished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is thoroughly commented on but let's go into more detail on some points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enter-the-order-number"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enter the order number
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we do when a call arrives is ask a caller to enter the order number and handle it using the &lt;code&gt;dtmfHandler&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the caller enters #, put them through to the operator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;need_operator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ToneReceived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleTones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callOperator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they enter a 5-digit number, call the &lt;code&gt;handleInput&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;repeatAskForInput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Received number is ${store.input}. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleTones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ToneReceived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#search-the-order"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Search the order
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to compare the entered number with order numbers in the store using the &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/voxengine/applicationstorage#get"&gt;ApplicationStorage.get()&lt;/a&gt; method and the entered number as a key here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Looking for a match in the key-value store by the entered number: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inputRecieved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;kvsAnswer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ApplicationStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the order is found, get the courier and customer phone numbers connected with it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;kvsAnswer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Order is found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Received response from kvs: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;kvsAnswer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;kvsAnswer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we need to figure out to whom to call. If the caller’s number is the courier’s, forward a call to the customer, if it’s the customer’s – to the courier. The &lt;code&gt;callCourierOrClient&lt;/code&gt; function is intended for this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;caller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Courier is calling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phone_search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Phone number is found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callCourierOrClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;caller&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Customer is calling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phone_search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Phone number is found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callCourierOrClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the number is not in the store, ask a caller to call again from the number they used when placing the order:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Number of the caller does not match the numbers received from kvs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wrongPhone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phone_search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Phone number is not found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleTones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ToneReceived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dtmfHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wrongPhone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addInputTimeouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, handle what happens when the order number is not in the store. In such a case, ask the caller to make sure the number is correct and enter it again:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;No match in kvs for the entered number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;order_search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Order is not found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleTones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ToneReceived&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dtmfHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wrongOrder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Clearing the timer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;longInputTimerId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;. `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addInputTimeouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#call-the-customercourier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Call the customer/courier
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's go directly to the call, i.e. to the &lt;code&gt;callCourierOrClient&lt;/code&gt; function. Here we tell the caller that we're transferring their call to the courier/client and play music on hold. We use the &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/voxengine/voxengine/callpstn?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;callPSTN&lt;/a&gt; method to call the client or the courier (depending on whose number was previously identified as the caller's number):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitForClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitForCourier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VoxEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callPSTN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;callid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startPlayback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;http://cdn.voximplant.com/toto.mp3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we tell the callee that the call is about clarification of information on the order:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Connected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_available&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;courierIsCalling&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientIsCalling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopPlayback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VoxEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendMediaBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, handle the disconnect event:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Disconnected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hangup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notify the caller if the callee is unavailable:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;secondCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_available&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;No&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopPlayback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sub_status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Courier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clientUnavailable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;phrases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;courierUnavailable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hangup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;say&lt;/code&gt; method is responsible for all the phrases the robot utters. The phrases themselves are in the &lt;strong&gt;phrases&lt;/strong&gt; associative array. We use &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/voxengine/voicelist/yandex?utm_source=devto&amp;amp;utm_medium=techarticle&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vox_kvs"&gt;Yandex as a TTS provider&lt;/a&gt;, the voice of Аlyss:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VoiceList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Yandex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Neural&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;en_US_alyss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlaybackFinished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CallEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PlaybackFinished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among other things, our scenario records the calls using the &lt;a href="https://voximplant.com/docs/references/voxengine/call#record"&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; method and enables you to save statistics to the database. In our code, the &lt;code&gt;sendResultToDb&lt;/code&gt; function handles this. This is very important for business because it allows you to analyze statistics, provide quality control and quickly resolve any issues that might arise during the delivery process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#test-the-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Test the app
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you add the full code to the scenario and the order details to the storage, feel free to start testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's call from the customer's or courier's phone number to the number rented in the panel. Then enter the order number (in our case, it is 12345) and wait for the connection with the other party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do everything correctly, the customer and the courier will be able to call each other and discuss the details of the order without knowing each other's personal numbers, and thus without any privacy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad you read all the way to the end of this article. It means it was gripping, right? :) Anyway, I wish you successful development and trouble-free order delivery! Stay tuned for more helpful articles in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is CSS in JS?</title>
      <author>Anjan Shomooder</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:24:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thatanjan/what-is-css-in-js-c7d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thatanjan/what-is-css-in-js-c7d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CSS in JS is a way of writing css styles in javascript with much more flexibility and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already created a video about this on the Cules Coding youtube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be_C_Op8Tx8"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-css-in-js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why CSS in JS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a large-scale application with a lot of components.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WV7oUp8S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3hhjzdbu5um2857caf7t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WV7oUp8S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3hhjzdbu5um2857caf7t.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each component has different styles. So you add class names to them. Those&lt;br&gt;
class names have some styling.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AcrYlC6J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0hkzh47zyoul3gidtuwm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AcrYlC6J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0hkzh47zyoul3gidtuwm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is easy to mess up with component names like the picture below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xx0bpv6X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5agb2rilnuuzi6xe20gi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xx0bpv6X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5agb2rilnuuzi6xe20gi.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your whole layout breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this blog is originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.culescoding.space/blog/what-is-css-in-js"&gt;cules coding website. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4xNHWOm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/stgvu126ak645n9mxl20.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y4xNHWOm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/stgvu126ak645n9mxl20.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be glad if you give it a visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-can-this-problem-be-solved"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How can this problem be solved?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is &lt;code&gt;Scoping CSS&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of writing css globally in css styles, what if we can write them inside&lt;br&gt;
the component. Then the css styles won't affect other components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-how-do-we-do-something-like-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But how do we do something like this?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where css-in-js comes into play. Css in js is writing css inside&lt;br&gt;
javascript. And we want to write css inside javascript. Now, what css-in-js&lt;br&gt;
the library will do is, it will generate a unique class name for the component. And&lt;br&gt;
that class will have all the styles. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dMbVEByT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z7ugl99slnpqje0d5z8v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dMbVEByT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z7ugl99slnpqje0d5z8v.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will add a unique hash to the class name. Just because the hash will be&lt;br&gt;
unique, that's why all the components will have a different style. Now we have&lt;br&gt;
Scoping CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-write-css-in-js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we write CSS in JS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bunch of libraries out there. Popular ones are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://styled-components.com/"&gt; Styled Component &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://cssinjs.org/"&gt; JSS &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://emotion.sh/docs"&gt; Emotion &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e5j_cBJa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nxfggd0gqpxo6gwgjef9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e5j_cBJa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nxfggd0gqpxo6gwgjef9.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the Styled Component most. You can use whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-think-that-all-you-can-do-with-cssinjs-is-write-scoping-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't think that all you can do with css-in-js is write scoping Css.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of features that those libraries provide us. Like theming,&lt;br&gt;
props adaption, extending style, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also remember you are writing in JavaScript. That means you can create your&lt;br&gt;
functionalities and features. So, don't let yourself restrict within the library&lt;br&gt;
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more watch the video. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a video about how to build a carousel postcard with React, Material-UI, and Swiper.js.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-i-do-what-i-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do I do what I do?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet has revolutionized our life. I want to make the internet more beautiful and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-i-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do I do?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up being a full-stack software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-can-i-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What can I do?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can develop complex full-stack web applications like social media applications or e-commerce sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-have-i-done"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What have I done?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have developed a social media application called &lt;a href="https://con-fession.vercel.app/"&gt;Confession&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of this application is to help people overcome their imposter syndrome by sharing our failure stories.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XbQiTDS2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gjay62pz7byne4d8ja8v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XbQiTDS2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gjay62pz7byne4d8ja8v.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love to share my knowledge. So, I run a youtube channel called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBaGowNYTUsm3IDaHbLRMYw?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;Cules Coding&lt;/a&gt; where I teach people full-stack web development, data structure algorithms, and many more. So, Subscribe to Cules Coding so that you don't miss the cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#want-to-work-with-me"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Want to work with me?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking for a team where I can show my ambition and passion and produce great value for them.&lt;br&gt;
Contact me through my email or any social media as &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/thatanjan"&gt;@thatanjan&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>From Zero to Hero: Quick Tips to Navigating Open Source Like a Pro </title>
      <author>Rizel Scarlett</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:19:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/github/from-zero-to-hero-quick-tips-to-navigating-open-source-like-a-pro-4lhl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/github/from-zero-to-hero-quick-tips-to-navigating-open-source-like-a-pro-4lhl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling uncertain about contributing to an open source project for the first time, I understand. Navigating the open source space can feel intimidating. Recently, I overcame my fear of contributing, and I documented the experience &lt;a href="https://blackgirlbytes.dev/conquering-the-fear-of-contributing-to-open-source"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I gained the assurance I needed to make my first contribution by: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking for help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interacting with the community &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thoroughly reading the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and trusting my skillset &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that contributing to open source expanded my network, improved my reputation, boosted my confidence, and increased my technical skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#start-small"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Start Small
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don't need to be a technical expert to contribute to open source - the tips below can help you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #1: Read the Contributing.md&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Contributing.md is a markdown document often found at the root of an open source project. The existence of a Contributing.md can indicate that a project is welcoming, inclusive, and organized. For new contributors, this is an optimal way to orient yourself with the project initially. Every open source project may follow slightly different rules, but there's no need to guess what this project's maintainer prefers. If you read the Contributing.md, you'll learn how to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up your developer environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style your components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick up issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate with other project contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what Contributing.md look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P8oQl_89--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vinta-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/media/filer_public/4c/9c/4c9c3970-f6cb-4a7f-8bf2-e57a87679580/4_contributing.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P8oQl_89--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vinta-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/media/filer_public/4c/9c/4c9c3970-f6cb-4a7f-8bf2-e57a87679580/4_contributing.png" alt="Example contributing.md"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the Contributing. md, and if you still have questions, reach out to the community!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #2: Join the Triage Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're still new to coding or unfamiliar with the programming languages and tooling that the project uses. Fortunately, coding isn't the only way to make an impact. One option is to join the triage team. Taking on a triage role is valuable for both you and the maintainer. Your responsibilities may include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying needed features &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recording bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing, labeling, and prioritizing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing contributor's pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggesting functionality or coding improvements for pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintainers always need assistance with the above tasks. By performing these tasks, you'll stand out and gain transferable skills for QA or Product roles. Eventually, you may even feel comfortable contributing code to the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not all projects have a triage team. Reach out to the maintainer to ask if they do!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #3: Link Your Pull Request to an Issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By linking a pull request to an issue, you can automatically reflect the progress of an issue based on the pull request, which reduces the workload for you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the maintainer. This allows other collaborators to track the progress of an issue as well. You can do this by adding the keywords closes, resolves, or fixes followed by the issue number inside the pull request's description. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;closes #752&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also do this manually (shown in the gif below). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cvBLHVw---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.zenhub.com/content/images/2021/04/GH-keywords.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cvBLHVw---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://blog.zenhub.com/content/images/2021/04/GH-keywords.gif" alt="Example linking pull request to an issue"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read this &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; for more details on linking your pull request to an issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#level-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Level Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you are comfortable contributing to open source, you can step up your game with these tips!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #4: Leverage Multi-line Comments for Suggestions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub enables you to highlight multiple lines in a pull request diff and add a comment. You can use this feature while reviewing a collaborator's pull request. If you highlight multiple lines and suggest code changes, the collaborator can directly commit those suggestions to their branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nCgmJJHU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.stack.imgur.com/gP2bG.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nCgmJJHU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.stack.imgur.com/gP2bG.gif" alt="Example highlighting multiple lines for comments"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #5: Save Your Replies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your involvement within the project increases, you may feel like there's not enough time in your day to compose a response to every collaborator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within GitHub, you can create and save reusable responses to specific issues and pull requests. If you ever become the project maintainer or writer, you can also benefit from the saved replies feature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rg8ZVtQO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5cfe6b80-f293-11e5-8065-e13fe452d394.gif%3Ffit%3D1392%252C708" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rg8ZVtQO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5cfe6b80-f293-11e5-8065-e13fe452d394.gif%3Ffit%3D1392%252C708" alt="Example of saving replies"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #6: Automate Your Workflows with GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions is a tool that conveniently enables you to automate custom workflows inside of your GitHub repository. You can trigger a workflow to run a set of jobs when a specified event, such as a pull request or a push to a particular branch. The next time you find yourself or your collaborators manually repeating tasks, implement GitHub Actions to enhance your CI/CD pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For inspiration: Read about how I used &lt;a href="https://blackgirlbytes.dev/how-to-sync-an-s3-bucket-with-github-actions"&gt;GitHub Actions to sync an AWS S3 Bucket&lt;/a&gt; with my GitHub repo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Tips for Successful Pair Programming</title>
      <author>Jenny from the B</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:58:24 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jfromtheblock/7-tips-for-successful-pair-programming-776</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pair programming is a great way to work on a software project and share knowledge. It’s when two or more programmers work together. Usually, one developer is leading while the other is providing feedback and following the development. The benefits of pair programming are many: improved code quality, greater knowledge transfer, and increased motivation and satisfaction among developers. With that said, there are some challenges to overcome when doing pair programming that you need to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, are 7 pair programming tips for having a productive coding session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-1-plan-together"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #1: Plan together
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XJuQaH9V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kdjt7t1w029x0fkv9u8k.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XJuQaH9V--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kdjt7t1w029x0fkv9u8k.gif" alt="Plan together"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before start programming, plan what you are going to do and what are your goals. Is this about building something new? Debugging? Mentoring a junior developer? Be clear about your goals and communicate them to your partner. It could be that the most experienced developer is responsible for planning, but it doesn't need to be like that. Plan together and have your partner participate too.&lt;br&gt;
Be sure to know a bit about your peer before starting the pair programming session. There are many different ways to do this. Each person should be given the opportunity to chat before the session starts. They can get to know their development’s style, quirks, and preferences. This helps you both understand each other’s mental model and put a plan in practice that makes the session more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan your pair programming session:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the task, what we are trying to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length of the session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often should change roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any personal preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-2-change-roles-regularly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #2: Change roles regularly
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MxgTEynx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/4huo31PRqTWve/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611faeac6c42bea1a7adda7a2ccde31515d5c02e8c8%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MxgTEynx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/4huo31PRqTWve/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611faeac6c42bea1a7adda7a2ccde31515d5c02e8c8%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Change roles when pair programming"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common mistakes developers make when doing pair programming is switching roles too often or not switching at all. How often you need to change roles depends on the experience level and how long is the session. If the session is less than 60 minutes long, you can switch just one time. If the session is shorter, it might be more productive to have just one person leading, but you still can switch in the half.&lt;br&gt;
If you are working in a longer session, you need to be more conscious about the roles and when to change. It can happen that you are so focused on the task that you forget about changing roles. That's a mistake. Be sure to change regularly and you can use the Pomodoro technique to help with this.&lt;br&gt;
In summary: to make things simple, start by changing roles every 30 minutes using the Pomodoro timer. Don't let your excitement of coding prevent you from giving the opportunity to the other developer to be leading the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-3-good-audio-and-video-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #3: Good audio and video setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_aDjoiqT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/hwdbyECRhzjXMzrDze/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611483c84377ea719735a76d179dd779815ecd97e5d%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_aDjoiqT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/hwdbyECRhzjXMzrDze/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611483c84377ea719735a76d179dd779815ecd97e5d%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Good audio and video"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the pair programming tips from this guide are considering that you are working remotely. In this scenario is crucial to have a good audio and video setup that allows you to communicate clearly.&lt;br&gt;
First a basic pair programming tip: Be sure to have a good internet connection and to be in a place without much noise.&lt;br&gt;
Although is not required, it's good practice to turn ON your video camera when pair programming. Communication is not only about what you say, but your body expression, how your face is reacting, etc. By having a video camera active your colleague can be more engaged and the session can be more entertaining for both sides.&lt;br&gt;
For audio communication, be sure to use headsets. You don't need to go crazy with professional fancy audio equipment. Anything that makes you comfortable works. A headset that you can properly hear the other person and that they can understand you is already good enough.&lt;br&gt;
Some tools like Duckly (shameless plug, I know) can help you a lot here as it has all the features for real-time code sharing and audio and video communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-4-avoid-micromanagement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #4: Avoid micro-management
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G33vkqPm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/eJdm1B40mtj4nmUgyS/giphy-downsized.gif%3Fcid%3D790b76110490a9ff4ebd3126f64b8904c7cdfcc58ff496dc%26rid%3Dgiphy-downsized.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G33vkqPm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/eJdm1B40mtj4nmUgyS/giphy-downsized.gif%3Fcid%3D790b76110490a9ff4ebd3126f64b8904c7cdfcc58ff496dc%26rid%3Dgiphy-downsized.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Avoid micro-management"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying and counter-productive behaviors that can happen in a pair programming session is when a developer starts to micro-manage. This is more common than you know, but really kills the purpose of the pair programming. To have a safe environment for collaboration that increases knowledge sharing between developers.&lt;br&gt;
Micro-management usually happens when one developer is more experienced (or just more opinionated) and try to force their point-of-view, dictate code, and is rigid about how exactly things should be done. This creates a negative feedback loop where confidence is low, more mistakes are done, more line-per-line comments...making the session slower and less collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-5-be-nice-and-patient"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #5: Be nice and patient
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tc4uae6E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/aAqGpWoSgGjnO/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611ab16fd80145eaf7daa40131f6d01b1b95569fc2b%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tc4uae6E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/aAqGpWoSgGjnO/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b7611ab16fd80145eaf7daa40131f6d01b1b95569fc2b%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Be nice and patient"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to micro-management, lack of patient makes the pairing experience much worst. This could happen when working with people with different skill levels and when a more experienced dev doesn't give their partner time to process their code. It can be tempting to be interrupting their flow to quickly correct errors, but this only breaks their flow and confidence. You can always write things down and comment later.  This will give you time to understand if that's really a problem that should be fixed or maybe it was already fixed somewhere else (or you didn't notice that there was a different way to solve it).&lt;br&gt;
However, independently if there is a mistake or not, just be nice to people. We are all learning and trying to have a good time. Rule of thumb: Just be a nice person to work and collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-6-avoid-external-distractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #6: Avoid external distractions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pL9_E57y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/QvAx77lUmfSwVhVxuv/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761140c4187a94e1980c73c258958e35fc3ab302b835%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pL9_E57y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/QvAx77lUmfSwVhVxuv/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761140c4187a94e1980c73c258958e35fc3ab302b835%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Avoid external distractions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specially when working remotely, there are several challenges and distractions that you need to overcome. Phone notifications, emails, delivery on the door, etc. These interruptions are easier to battle if you are leading the pair programming, but if you are following you can find yourself drifting away on some occasions.&lt;br&gt;
Ignore emails or any media while pairing. Don't schedule meetings that can interrupt your session. On top of that, don't do super long sessions that can last for hours. Take breaks and schedule time for other activities that are not programming.&lt;br&gt;
Be present and respectful with your partner, but also wise about how you allocate your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pair-programming-tip-7-constant-communication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pair programming tip #7: Constant communication
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--djCoDeoO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/8HZyasm0zfsuk/giphy-downsized.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761117293c6bf9b4158105a47bcf39983cd8d7b35023%26rid%3Dgiphy-downsized.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--djCoDeoO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/8HZyasm0zfsuk/giphy-downsized.gif%3Fcid%3D790b761117293c6bf9b4158105a47bcf39983cd8d7b35023%26rid%3Dgiphy-downsized.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="Constant communication"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programming can be challenging, but it can be harder when one person has trouble keeping up or someone feels that they are coding alone. To avoid this, you should be actively communicating with your partner all the time. This will also make the session more engaging and fun. You don't need to be interrupting all the time or commenting on every single line (as we talked before), but let know that you are there for them and that you are working together.&lt;br&gt;
The point of doing a pair programming session is to not be coding alone, so be present and participate with your partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing thoughts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programming has a lot of advantages in comparison with solo coding: knowledge sharing, better code quality, improved communication. However, it also contains its own set of challenges. These pair programming tips can help you have a great collaborative and knowledge sharing session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plan your session properly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change roles regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a good audio-video setup,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be mindful about micro-management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be patient and nice with your people and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communicate with your partner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Showdev: Coloors, the Coolors Color Palette Clone</title>
      <author>Nathan Pham</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:42:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/phamn23/showdev-coloors-the-coolors-color-palette-clone-2npj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/phamn23/showdev-coloors-the-coolors-color-palette-clone-2npj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried building a color palette generator to learn the basics of GraphQL. It's not a "high fidelity" clone of &lt;a href="https://coolors.co/"&gt;Coolors&lt;/a&gt;, but it borrows some key concepts like the explore page, generator, animations, and general styles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Express, Apollo GraphQL, Deta, Ion Icons, standard HTML/CSS/JS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#demo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty much done with this project for now, but refactoring code is a huge priority. I used ES6 modules to help separate code, but I dumped most of the stuff into random utility files. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I learned from selling a side project online</title>
      <author>JS Bits with Bill</author>

      <link>https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/what-i-learned-from-selling-a-side-project-online-370f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/js_bits_bill/what-i-learned-from-selling-a-side-project-online-370f</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happened"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happened?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I made a simple website and Chrome extension that let users save recipes online. It was extremely basic and initially started out as a project where I could learn basic authentication with services like PassportJS. Over time, I continuously improved it and added more features and better UX. I didn't market at all, but after several months, a few hundred people were using the service. Eventually I wanted to move on to other projects so I listed and sold my site online last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B3eBlALH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/dzynqn10l/image/upload/v1630962134/JS%2520Bits/recipe-saver-dashboard_y0fzf1.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B3eBlALH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/dzynqn10l/image/upload/v1630962134/JS%2520Bits/recipe-saver-dashboard_y0fzf1.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Recipe Saver - My side project baby&lt;/em&gt; 👶&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#insights"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Insights
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-your-site-is-worth-whatever-someone-is-offering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1) Your site is worth whatever someone is offering
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with a number in your head. Now, throw it out! Sure, you can list a minimum bid amount, but you'll quickly see your true market value once you start fielding inquiries. Unless you're selling a well-known, highly established website, you'll need to negotiate off whatever buyers are offering. Mine had 2-3 serious inquiries and ultimately sold for a few thousand dollars. Not enough to buy that yacht, but I'm proud of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-selling-can-relieve-the-burden-of-perpetual-maintenance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2) Selling can relieve the burden of perpetual maintenance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few web apps require little maintenance. Customers will forget their credentials, server stacks and databases will require upgrades, and so on. In my case, I felt that I had experimented enough in monetizing my app without success. There's an opportunity cost to everything and selling can award you peace of mind of successfully ending to your side project baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-you-dont-need-a-ton-of-customers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3) You don't need a ton of customers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think your product needs hundreds of thousands of customers for buyers to be interested. Not necessarily. I had a userbase of 7,500 accounts - many of which were very active. Based on user feedback, my customers liked the site overwhelmingly because it was extremely easy to use. &lt;b&gt;Potential buyers may see value in less-obvious ways.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps your site uses some technology or algorithm that can be repurposed for a different application. Or maybe user-generated content is valuable for marketers to understand trendlines in an industry. There are dozens of ways your application can hold value for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-theres-no-guarantee-your-project-will-live-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4) There's no guarantee your project will live on
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the most painful lesson learned. Despite the buyer agreeing to continue supporting the site, after a year it was sold again and the new &lt;b&gt;new&lt;/b&gt; owner was apparently only interested in the data. Not only were old customers unable to use the service anymore, but I had to retrieve backups of their data so they wouldn't lose their recipes. I felt terribly about it and did my best to &lt;b&gt;make things right&lt;/b&gt; for those who loyally used my service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-be-prepared-to-support-things-for-a-while"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5) Be prepared to support things for a while
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set expectations for both the buyer and your customers that services WILL be disrupted for a time. In my case, these were just some of the supporting services that had to be individually transferred to the new owner: Heroku, GitHub, Cloudinary, Gmail, Mailgun, Google, Facebook, Stripe, Google Analytics, MongoDB, the domain, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of these did not allow "adding an admin" to the account so transferring can take lot of time. Further, it's essential that you &lt;b&gt;create stellar documentation&lt;/b&gt; so that your buyer can be self-serviceable (otherwise, be prepared to be pinged a lot!).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's it! Despite the eventual discontinuation after the second sale, it was still the right decision as my desire to support and evolve the site had waned long before I listed it. Another driving factor was that similar sites starting cropping up and this kind of service became available for a dime-a-dozen. With competing priorities and interests, I knew it was time. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what to expect if you go this route, but if you have any more questions about the process or how it went down, let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-can-you-sell-side-projects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where can you sell side projects?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actually a look of places! Here's a few popular ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.sideprojectors.com/"&gt;SideProjectors&lt;/a&gt; (where I sold mine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/contribute"&gt;IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://flippa.com/"&gt;Flippa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places where you can showcase your site and garner feedback before taking to market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/"&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://owwly.com/products/all"&gt;Owwly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yo!&lt;/b&gt; I post byte-sized tips like these often. Follow me if you crave more! 🍿&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@js_bits"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JS_Bits_Bill"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I have a new &lt;a href="https://jsbits-yo.com/bug-bash/"&gt;debugging course&lt;/a&gt; dropping soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Credit Card Payment UI With ReactJS </title>
      <author>Chris Hansen </author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:36:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hyggedev/credit-card-payment-ui-with-reactjs-1a5a</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hyggedev/credit-card-payment-ui-with-reactjs-1a5a</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a tutorial, or anything even informational. Just a place to share my project, hoping to inspire some creativity. Hopefully you learn about a new resource or try a new project. Repo is available! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hey-devs-were-pretty-fortunate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hey devs, we're pretty fortunate 😉
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This badass platform gives us the ability to show off a project with the "#showdev" community tag and I am taking that opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://credit-payment-ui.netlify.app/"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chansen17/creditCardPaymentUI"&gt;Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/"&gt;Cleave.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#try-different-credit-card-issuers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Try different credit card issuers:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visa cards start with 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastercards 51 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover 6011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amex 34&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diners Club 300 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ReactJS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom SCSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleave.JS &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic rendering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#something-to-point-out"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Something to point out
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FUNNIEST thing about the entire project, what I am also the most proud of, is the holographic sticker on the top left! It's a picture of raindrops on a window! 🤣 &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about it. So much more could be added to this. For example, I would like to add a rotateX animation that allows the user to instead enter their security code on the back, once they click on the form field! That would be cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are practicing frontend development and using React, give it a go! It's really based on all the fundamentals of React and the basics of Javascript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show off your project below if you end up giving a shot! I'm sure you can do something even better! 😎&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Set Sail with Tailwind CSS</title>
      <author>Eric SK.C</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:25:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/giantmachines/set-sail-with-tailwind-css-4o06</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/giantmachines/set-sail-with-tailwind-css-4o06</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p8Yl-SQi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/migb48qts4tef03yy6sd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p8Yl-SQi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/migb48qts4tef03yy6sd.png" alt="TailwindCSS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS frameworks have become incredibly prevalent in web design over the years, with Google’s &lt;a href="https://material.io/"&gt;Material Design&lt;/a&gt; aesthetic gradually appearing throughout the web and &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;Bootstrap’s&lt;/a&gt; library of plugins and themes becoming a popular default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news is, the days of pages looking like this... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IuhGP7HU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/scc4y41tv9lp4p82mfk9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IuhGP7HU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/scc4y41tv9lp4p82mfk9.png" alt="Old Amazon" title="Amazon before it was cool"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
are long behind us, thanks in part to CSS frameworks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like many rebellious people, you may be asking, what can I use that’s not mainstream yet? Is there a better, more modern solution? Isn’t there something out there that doesn’t involve Google’s or Twitter's participation at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt;, a new up-and-comer, is a framework that’s been making a name for itself since 2017. Tailwind was rated highest in satisfaction and interest by users from over 100 countries in both 2019 and 2020, as recorded by the &lt;a href="https://stateofcss.com/"&gt;State of CSS survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uXxXft_9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7w5sp9og2iszccusdwzh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uXxXft_9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7w5sp9og2iszccusdwzh.png" alt="State of CSS Survey" title="State of CSS Survey"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind provides a collection of pre-built utility classes, allowing developers to directly style HTML elements without needing to create CSS classes or write any CSS at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lets Tailwind shine in its simplicity, flexibility, and available customization options. Unlike Material and Bootstrap, which provide opinionated pre-built elements (and which require a substantial setup and demanding syntax), Tailwind provides hassle-free access to styling CSS simply and quickly via utility classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had a great idea for a frontend project, jumped straight into coding, and wanted to immediately flesh out that brilliant UI in your mind, Tailwind would allow you to style quickly before the inspiration left you, simply by slapping some of their utility classes on your markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll be discussing how Tailwind works and the benefits and drawbacks of using it. We'll examine the basic setup and workflow of Tailwind. Then we'll look at implementing Tailwind with SASS or Styled Components, as well as building for responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get on with it, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-tailwind-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does Tailwind work?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#utility-classes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Utility Classes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. A utility class is a reusable CSS class that styles an element for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we’re expecting multiple elements to need a background color of blue. To create a utility class for this, we’d create a CSS class named &lt;code&gt;bg-blue&lt;/code&gt; and give it the style &lt;code&gt;background-color: blue&lt;/code&gt;. Now we can place our utility class &lt;code&gt;bg-blue&lt;/code&gt; onto the numerous HTML elements where the background needs to be blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that concept understood, Tailwind essentially provides a huge collection of pre-built utility classes so you don’t have to create them yourself. It relies on stacking these classes onto HTML elements to fully style the element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Tailwind, you may never need to write CSS. Instead, you'd just insert utility classes. For example, to easily create a button with rounded corners, a mild box shadow, and centered white text, you’d simply add the following utility classes to your element:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bg-blue-300 rounded-md shadow-md text-center 
p-8 text-white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;examples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;referencing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's all you'd need to do to get a styled button that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QtIFegL8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j3goed8aq7n24eumhsvo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QtIFegL8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j3goed8aq7n24eumhsvo.png" alt="Blue Button using Tailwind styles" title="Blue Button using Tailwind styles"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind provides hundreds if not thousands of utility classes, each with specific styling purposes. There is a class named &lt;code&gt;.text-center&lt;/code&gt; with a single CSS property of &lt;code&gt;text-align: center&lt;/code&gt;, another named &lt;code&gt;.p-8&lt;/code&gt; that has &lt;code&gt;padding: 2rem&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This is how Tailwind works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benefits-amp-drawbacks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benefits &amp;amp; Drawbacks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pros"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pros
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most apparent benefit to using Tailwind’s utility classes is it allows the developer to create their markup and style it at the same time without the need of creating CSS classes (or writing any CSS!). A developer using Tailwind would never need to leave their HTML or JSX code when building out views and components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be especially beneficial if you’ve ever needed to put together a quick demo or MVP, or simply scaffold a UI to better visualize your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An enormous perk provided by default is that Tailwind will automatically remove all unused CSS from the bundle sent to the browser. At build time, Tailwind will purge all unused CSS classes, creating the smallest CSS bundle your code can possibly provide, &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/#performance"&gt;averaging at less than 10kb&lt;/a&gt;. This can dramatically improve page load times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a styling framework, Tailwind is arguably less opinionated than other frameworks like Bootstrap and Material. Very often when using other frameworks, developers will find themselves rewriting the CSS provided by the framework to fully suit their needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For more, see &lt;a href="https://themesberg.com/blog/design/tailwind-css-vs-bootstrap"&gt;the differences between Tailwind CSS &amp;amp; Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cons
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial learning curve of Tailwind can be unappealing, as you will inevitably find yourself returning to its docs to learn the correct utility class name. Something as traditional as setting &lt;code&gt;padding-top: 1rem&lt;/code&gt; is now&lt;code&gt;pt-4&lt;/code&gt; with Tailwind. In the beginning, this could potentially outweigh all the benefits Tailwind provides in regards to speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you’ve familiarized yourself with Tailwind, however, I guarantee you’ll find the utility class names to be as simple as remembering CSS attributes themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SY1mkb8d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wmcoplkfug2cndyr91oy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SY1mkb8d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wmcoplkfug2cndyr91oy.png" alt="Tailwind padding class names" title="Tailwind padding class names"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though Tailwind is relatively unopinionated, the pre-built utility classes still have set values. For example, &lt;code&gt;text-red-300&lt;/code&gt; is a utility class for text color with preset values for red, specifically &lt;code&gt;rgba(252, 165, 165, 1)&lt;/code&gt;. Thankfully, these defaults can all be adjusted in a &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file to suit your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, Tailwind doesn’t provide any styled components out of the box. All the components provided in a library like Bootstrap (for example, general navigation, buttons, headers) need to be implemented from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwind-implementation-amp-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tailwind Implementation &amp;amp; Workflow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off, you’ll want to install Tailwind with npm. To get the latest version and its peer dependencies, run &lt;code&gt;npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to customize some things, run &lt;code&gt;npx tailwindcss init&lt;/code&gt; to create the &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file. This file allows custom implementation of styling, which we’ll discuss in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To inject Tailwind’s functionality, you will need a CSS file that includes these lines:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* ./your-css-folder/styles.css */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@tailwind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;utilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From here, you’re free to jump straight into coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to keep in mind are the purpose and roadmap of your project. If you simply need something up and running with a deadline coming up, the basic implementation of Tailwind is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know you’re going to be refactoring and potentially even removing Tailwind further down the road, be sure to pair your Tailwind code with SASS or Styled Component files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping these details in mind will foster a cleaner codebase, or a better transition into one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwind-config"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tailwind Config
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are you’re going to be customizing your Tailwind utility classes, because let’s be honest, their utility library doesn’t include everything. As an example, any kind of custom animation that isn’t a pulse or bounce will require a configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set this up, make sure to run &lt;code&gt;npx tailwindcss init&lt;/code&gt;. This will create a minimal &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, you can set whatever you might need that isn’t included by default in Tailwind, which may be custom fonts, animations, specific breakpoints, new utility classes, or adjusting Tailwind’s pre-built utility classes. Any custom styles here will take precedence over Tailwind’s existing classes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;purge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./public/index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// or 'media' or 'class'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;fontFamily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;sans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;AvenirLTPro-Heavy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;AvenirLTPro-Light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;AvenirLTPro-Black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;AvenirLTPro-Medium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;AvenirLTPro-Light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;screens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;xs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;320px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;sx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;420px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;lighter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#3064b1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#CAE0FE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#0E71FB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#082959&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;lightest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#F7FAFC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="na"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#E6EAF0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#D7DBE0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#6E6E6E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;darkest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;#333333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;slideIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;slideIn 200ms ease-in-out 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;keyframes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;slideIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;translateX(-100vw)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;translateX(0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tailwind-with-other-styling-packages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tailwind with Other Styling Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious issue with Tailwind is the verbose class names that will eventually clutter your HTML or JSX. If we look at the previous example for the button, the full list of classes applied is &lt;code&gt;bg-blue-300 rounded-md shadow-md text-center&lt;/code&gt;. If we wanted to add more styling, we would need even more utility classes, making this line even longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if every element were to look like this, the markup would become harder and harder to read.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;flex flex-col md:flex-row overflow-ellipsis
overflow-hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;p-1 w-11r md:w-20r md:p-2 lg:w-29r 
inline-block text-gray-darkest font-sans flex items-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text-xs overflow-ellipsis overflow-hidden
xs:truncate md:text-base md:overflow-clip
md:whitespace-normal md:overflow-visible max-h-10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;p-1 w-5r md:w-8r inline-block flex 
items-center justify-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text-xs md:text-base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;formatDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Unspecified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Possible solutions to this problem involve pairing Tailwind with either SASS or Styled Components.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#with-sass-using-apply"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  With SASS Using @apply
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common practice with Tailwind is to combine its usage with SASS/SCSS. A convention I've found useful is to limit the utility classes on any HTML element to 5 or 6. If an element requires further styling, you can use &lt;code&gt;@apply&lt;/code&gt; to style a SASS class using Tailwind utility classes, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card-body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="err"&gt;@apply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;px-4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;pb-4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;text-lg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;pt-0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;font-helvetica-neue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;text-center&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;text-white&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, you’re free to set this class wherever you need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#with-styled-components-using-twmacro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  With Styled Components Using tw.macro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Tailwind alongside Styled Components, we’re going to need some extra dependencies, these being &lt;code&gt;tailwind.macro&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;babel-plugin-macros&lt;/code&gt;. The combination of these two will allow Babel to read Tailwind utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that’s done, you can start setting Tailwind utilities under &lt;code&gt;className&lt;/code&gt; in your styled components.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;styled-components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;tailwind.macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppStyles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;attrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;w-full h-screen flex flex-col 
items-center justify-center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
  h1 {
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`font-sans text-6xl text-teal-500`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
  }
  p {
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`text-lg text-gray-700`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
  }
  ul {
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;tw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`inline-flex mx-5`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
  }
`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed implementation, check out these blogs by &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-your-react-apps-with-less-code-using-tailwind-css-and-styled-components/"&gt;Ibrahima Ndaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dev.to/dbshanks/an-efficient-react-tailwindcss-styled-components-workflow-458m"&gt;Derek Shanks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-for-responsiveness"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building for Responsiveness
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#media-queries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Media Queries
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the nice perks of using Tailwind is the simplicity of responsive styling. By default, Tailwind is mobile-first in regards to responsiveness. In other words, the breakpoints under the hood are specified using &lt;code&gt;min-width&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;bg-blue-300 rounded-md shadow-md text-center
p-8 text-white text-sm md:text-md md:p-10 lg:text-lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;padding&lt;/code&gt; will change when the breakpoint for &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; is reached, and the &lt;code&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; is enlarged even further when &lt;code&gt;lg&lt;/code&gt; the breakpoint is reached. To know the exact measurements for sizes like &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;lg&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll have to refer to the &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs"&gt;Tailwind docs&lt;/a&gt; for the specific attributes. In regards to breakpoints, &lt;code&gt;sm&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;640px&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;768px&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;lg&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1024px&lt;/code&gt;. These can all be adjusted, and more sizes can be added, in the &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt; file. For example, if you wanted &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; to represent &lt;code&gt;800px&lt;/code&gt;, you can change that in &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// tailwind.config.js&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;screens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;640px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; @media (min-width: 640px) {...}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;800px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; @media (min-width: 800px) {...}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1024px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; @media (min-width: 1024px) {...}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;xl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1280px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; @media (min-width: 1280px) {...}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2xl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1536px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; @media (min-width: 1536px) {...}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Tailwind provides is a streamlined experience to web styling. It doesn’t require a massive amount of boilerplate to get started and certainly doesn’t push pre-styled button components or form elements which you might end up needing to restyle yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind simply provides developers an efficient and fast method of styling so they can get straight to work. It can especially come in handy when you want to quickly add some pizzazz to early stage and personal projects, and it can even scale to larger projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to deploy your NodeJS / Flask application to Qovery in less than five minutes</title>
      <author>𝐋𝐄𝑽𝐈𝑨𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐍 Programming</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:25:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/leviathanprogramming/how-to-deploy-your-nodejs-flask-application-to-qovery-ld3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/leviathanprogramming/how-to-deploy-your-nodejs-flask-application-to-qovery-ld3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All my prayers have been answered once I found &lt;a href="https://qovery.com"&gt;Qovery&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a super affordable hosting service that is amazingly powerful and gives you maximized ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are still clinging to Heroku, Netlify, Terraform, etc; consider reading these articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hub.qovery.com/docs/getting-started/qovery-vs-other/heroku/"&gt;Qovery vs Heroku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hub.qovery.com/docs/getting-started/qovery-vs-other/netlify/"&gt;Qovery vs Netlify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hub.qovery.com/docs/getting-started/qovery-vs-other/terraform/"&gt;Qovery vs Terraform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that being said, I will show you how to deploy a nodeJS and python application to Qovery in less than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploying-a-nodejs-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying a NodeJS Application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you've already signed up for Qovery, developed your app, and put all the code into a github repository.  Those are the main steps you need to do and the rest is a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create a file called &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; in your application.  Assuming you are deploying an expressJS app, your dockerfile should look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; node:14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; /usr/src/app
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; /usr/src/app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; . .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;EXPOSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; 3000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["node", "index.js"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, you don't even need to have docker installed.  Qovery takes care of all that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, push to the git repo and update it.  Next, you're going to want to create a new project on your &lt;a href="https://console.qovery.com"&gt;qovery console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, create an environment in that project.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your first app, connect to the correct git repo, and finally, a very important step, set the build mode to Docker, and set the port to 3000.&lt;br&gt;
You can technically use a different port to add your app on, but in this tutorial, let's use 3000.  Make sure your app is listening on that port!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to change that port, make sure you change the code in your dockerfile, the &lt;code&gt;EXPOSE 3000&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;EXPOSE &amp;lt;your-port&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--talNbANi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ujoak9vx34cnmsyxst9q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--talNbANi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ujoak9vx34cnmsyxst9q.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 9.11.45 AM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update your settings if you want, then click the Actions button and then deploy your app.  Once it's in a RUNNING state, your app is ready!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gXS92yrW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ib3jus7ylphfui67wz9i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gXS92yrW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ib3jus7ylphfui67wz9i.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-17 at 9.16.46 AM"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deploying your Python Flask app
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign up for qovery, create your project, and then link it to a github repo.  Add your dockerfile into your app.  It should look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; python:3.8-slim-buster&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; /usr/src/app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; . ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;pip &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; requirements.txt
&lt;span class="k"&gt;EXPOSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; 3000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["python","app.py"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure your app is listening on port 3000.  You don't need to install docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Push your code to the git repo, create a new project, a new environment, and then an app.  Make sure the build mode is Docker and not Buildpacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the Actions button, deploy your project, and you should be ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope qovery is something you'll be enjoying from now on.  It is something that is super amazing, secure, and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
