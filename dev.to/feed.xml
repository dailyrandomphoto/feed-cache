      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, there has been an exponential increase in video consumption. According to Statista, in 2019 alone, the number of digital video viewers was 2.6 billion, which is reported to increase up to 3.1 billion in 2023. With the increase in the number of viewers, the number of platforms catering to them also increased. A few years back Netflix was the only major player in the video streaming market. But now there are many more platforms, including Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, Hulu, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many streaming platforms available, users often prefer to pirate content rather than pay for a particular platform. In this current scenario, if you don’t focus much on video protection, chances are that your videos will be downloaded and freely available for users. This in turn hurts your revenue by a lot, as users would rather prefer to watch your content for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie industry alone suffers an annual loss of revenue of about 40 and $97.1 billion. If your account for eLearning, personal wellness, and other online platforms, this number can rise up even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t necessarily have to lose your revenue due to piracy. DRM solutions or Digital Rights Management, solely exist for this purpose- to save your videos from any illegal access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, you might be wondering, what exactly is a DRM Solution? How can it help you? And many more questions. But you don’t have to worry about it, as you’ll get an answer to these questions and more. So, fasten your seat belts and bring out your notepads. Cause this is going to be a ride and not that one filled with just joy and excitement. Which only riddles you with guilt afterward. You’re only going to come out of this journey wiser (hopefully!?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-drm-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Is a DRM Solution?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdocipher.com/blog/in/drm-solution"&gt;DRM Solution&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a Digital Rights Management Software, which ensures that your content is only accessible by anyone you authorize. You can use &lt;a href="https://www.vdocipher.com/blog/2020/12/video-drm/"&gt;Video DRM&lt;/a&gt; Software to make sure that your content is only accessible by the user you authorize and you can even manage the browser or devices they consume your content on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of cases even though the videos are encrypted, the key used to decrypt the video is often easily accessible. Any hacker with some knowledge can then easily get access to the encryption key and then access your content. Once he’s downloaded the video it’s then easy to spread it to other pirates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a DRM solution, your encryption keys are hidden and aren’t accessible to anyone unless authorized by you. This way you protect your videos from any potential hacker or download tools. This makes sure that your content is not pirated and you don’t lose any revenue due to piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, with a DRM solution, video platforms tend to see a rise in their revenue. Read this case study by Vdocipher on how users end up raising their revenues up to 990% with the help of a DRM Solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DRM solution caters to different forms of content, they can be -video, audio, video games, comics, ebooks, etc. In this blog, I’ll focus on DRM solutions for video and audio streaming.&lt;br&gt;
But before that, let’s have a look at what DRM protected content exactly means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-drmprotected-mean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Does “DRM-Protected” Mean?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phrase “DRM protected” means that the digital content it is being applied to is restricted in how it can be used. “Digital rights management” is the term that describes a systematic authorization for the use of copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DRM protected content is nothing but the digital content on which DRM protection is applied. Basically, any piece of digital content you protect with a DRM solution would be considered as DRM protected content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the above section, content becomes DRM protected when you apply a certain set of rules on your copyrighted content to restrict any unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These DRM restrictions are usually against downloading or making a copy of your video. Also, the number of times your videos are being accessed and even the devices on which the video is being viewed. These DRM restrictions can be as simple or complex according to your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-drm-software-ensure-protection-for-your-videos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does DRM Software ensure protection for your Videos?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I take a deep dive into how DRM solutions work, you’ll first need to understand what video encryption is. Then later I’ll show you how a Video DRM solution makes encryption even better to ensure that your videos are protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#video-encryption"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Video Encryption
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video encryption is basically the process of encoding your videos to a non-video secure format. This ensures that no one can’t access your raw video files. When anyone wants to access the file, they’ll only get access to an encrypted file which is just random gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encryption can not be broken and the encrypted files can only be accessed with the help of an encryption key. But then the encryption key exchange is where the weakness lies for any standard video encryption technology such as HLS, RTMP or AES-128. Due to the weak key exchange, encryption keys can be accessed by hackers to decrypt and then access the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ultimately defeats the initial purpose of video encryption. Although it would hinder anyone with no technical knowledge, anyone with some understanding of how to access the keys can easily work it out and share the video file with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#drm-based-encryption-to-protect-your-videos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DRM based encryption to protect your videos
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DRM takes care of this exact weakness in video encryption and makes sure that the encryption key is not accessible by anyone unless authorized. A video DRM software encrypts the video and even protects the encryption key behind a BlackBox or CDM, which cannot be accessed by anyone. Before going into what a CDM is, you’ll need to know that there are different DRM solutions, which are used together to protect your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical video DRM solution consists of multi DRM, these different DRMS caters to different devices and browsers. These different DRM solutions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdocipher.com/blog/widevine-drm-hollywood-video/"&gt;Google Widevine DRM&lt;/a&gt; solution: It supports Desktop/Laptop (Windows, Mac, Linux) Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Android Chrome, Edge, Android TV, Android TV, Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdocipher.com/blog/fairplay-drm-ios-safari-html5/"&gt;Apple Fairplay DRM&lt;/a&gt; Solution: It supports Mac Safari, IOS Safari, IOS App&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Playready DRM solution: It supports Edge in Windows. Windows Edge is also supported by Google Widevine, so Playready is not an absolute necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DRM solution BlackBox the encryption keys in CDM or Content Decryption Module. This CDM, even though on your device, can not be accessed by you. This protects the key as it is kept in the CDM and it can’t be accessed by you or anyone. The only way to access the videos is through Encrypted Media Extensions (EMEs), which are sent via the respective Video DRM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Google and Apple have some control over your browser, OS, hardware or all of these. They can exercise more control and security for &lt;a href="https://www.vdocipher.com/page/drm"&gt;DRM encrypted streaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choosing-a-drm-service-provider-what-features-to-look-for"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choosing a DRM service provider: what features to look for?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing a DRM software, there are certain features that can make your content even more protected. One of these can be dynamic watermarking, which inhibits users from screen grab video. These are the features that you need to look out for in a DRM Solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encrypted-drm-streaming-to-prevent-download"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encrypted DRM Streaming to Prevent Download
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost is obviously the Video DRM protection. You need to make sure that the DRM service provider supports both Widevine DRM as well as Fairplay DRM. Having the two DRM is an absolute necessity as they pretty much guarantee DRM support on all the major devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#screen-capture-blocking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Screen Capture Blocking
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major feature you would require is a screen capture block. Even though the video downloads are blocked, users still can record your screen to capture videos. You need to make sure that the DRM Solution you go for stops any type of screen capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dynamic-watermarking-with-moving-user-details"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dynamic Watermarking with moving user details
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic watermarking helps to discourage any screen capture. You can add the IP address, User-Id, and Email-Id to the screen. Using these, you can identify the point of origin of video piracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ip-geo-amp-time-based-restriction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IP, Geo &amp;amp; Time Based Restriction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to restrict video playback in certain locations or devices. A Video DRM solution can help you restrict access to a particular Geo/IP. Also, you can put restrictions on total user video playtime&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Does a Video Production Company Work From the Inside?</title>
      <author>Explain Ninja</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 09:33:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/explain_ninja/how-does-a-video-production-company-work-from-the-inside-3f39</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/explain_ninja/how-does-a-video-production-company-work-from-the-inside-3f39</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video production is one of the most creative ways to produce videos for various needs. This process includes a large amount of work that a professional team must perform. Video production plays a unique role in marketing. After all, the final result of the video depends on your product marketing strategy. What does a video production company do to create the ideal material? Let’s check it out now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is a Video Production Company?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://explain.ninja/about/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;production studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a company of professionals specializing in producing video products of any complexity. A good production studio with a full range of services, from creative development, concept and ending with ready-made video solutions, is what you need to produce high-quality material for any business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there are a large number of areas in which companies that are engaged in video production may work. Among these areas, the main difference is between those that are videographers and video producers. To make the right decision for your business marketing, make sure you understand what the primary difference in model is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s the Difference Between a Videographer and a Video Production Company?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both business owners and marketers who need videos for their company often face the same dilemma: whom to choose as a performer. The choice is usually small. This is either a freelance videographer or a &lt;a href="https://explain.ninja/contact-us/"&gt;video production studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a production company? -  It is an officially registered company; each of the employees is highly specialized. The studio creative director forms a team of scriptwriters, directors, cameramen, editors, motion designers, and other specialists. The main customers of the company may be legal entities, government agencies, and other corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such companies are often called video production studios, which are the agencies that professionally create video advertisements, films, promotions and TV shows, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A videographer is primarily an independent specialist who works on freelance principles. It’s more likely an individual entrepreneur, a highly-skilled producer who shoots and edits videos for various niches. The main customers are individuals mostly. However, there may be exceptions, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a business owner, or a marketer, then the studio will be a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Does a Video Production Company Do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a production company do? Depending on their focus, it may be engaged in commercials, explainer videos, and filming documentaries, non-standard social or other projects.  Its work stands on three major stages: pre-production, production, and post-production. There’s much work to do on each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1.Conduct product and market research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-production is a planning stage. Every project starts with research and looking for deeper insights into the business and its audience. Based on the goal, audience, and context, the producer, as part of the creative team, forms the project's concept, timeline, and budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Meet and collaborate with clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you get to know the client, the task you’re going to work on and discuss the ideas. First, it is important to understand the goal, audience and the context of the video you want to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an idea that one video may solve only one goal at once. It is very difficult to convey two messages in a 10-30 second video explainer. So, the client needs to make a choice: either to inform the audience only, or create a brand image, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be clever to squeeze multiple goals into the series of videos, then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Audition actors, source props, and create wardrobe pieces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casting may be the most exciting stage of the work. You may organize a pre-production meeting (PPM). It is a meeting with a client, where the shooting day is discussed in as much detail as possible. Clothes, decorations, props, models are finally approved on it. PPM with the client must go before filming – you make sure all are on the same page to avoid miscommunication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Film videos and record audio clips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the team may already pass over to the next stage of video production, where they film material and record voices based on the script, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something always goes wrong. A producer here is a person who has several ready-made solutions/alternatives as a backup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has an idea of what an ideal process should look like and what’s right or wrong. Taking apart the shooting day into fragments together, you may understand what to fix in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Mix audio and music tracks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text must be thought over from scratch. Voiceovers are to be ready before you decide on the final cut. The essential selection of tracks for a video will make life easier for everyone. If you write music yourself, tell the client what the composer's track is, choose a reference by style and mood, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Create animations, motion graphics, and SFX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some video production involves special effects, graphics or other. Even storyboards are great way to start, support your video production, &lt;a href="https://explain.ninja/process/"&gt;improve the process&lt;/a&gt; and produce better quality material. For this part of work, you will need great experienced motion designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, but the post-production stage should be planned at pre-production, so that to keep the top specialists on board till the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Post videos online and contact TV stations for broadcasting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes video production companies also organize video distribution over the media or share the ready video content on other platforms as per the client’s agreement. Moreover, they may further promote it and gather analytics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That depends on how many tasks the client wants the company to perform within the contract.  A more common scenario is when clients distribute the material on their side, but still. It also may depend on the production company description, the way it positions its services, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not show raw material to the client. But even worse than that is to delay the delivery of the video. A product delayed for a week means the client's expectations increased twice. And who knows if you're going to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Video Production Company vs Studio: What is Better for You?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also realize that there are various types of production companies or studios. A &lt;strong&gt;studio may produce films for the general public, while companies specializing in&lt;/strong&gt; video production work for many other companies to help them create their desired content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, studios may be much larger and often acquire a corporate business configuration. They are trusted in terms of how does a production company work, what create, how cater at their clients and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many modern companies are often recommended to use the services of video production companies when they need to come up with the video content ideas for. What is a video production company and what is video production are the first things to understand before you pick an ideal video maker for your business needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, with the help of a video, you may reveal your business services and goods in a new way. Since modern users prefer only high-quality advertising campaigns, what do production companies do is meeting those high expectations and connecting their end-users with your products in an incredible way.&lt;/p&gt;

Why Developers Should Care About Knowledge Sharing</title>
      <author>Adriano Martins</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 09:18:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reviewpad/why-developers-should-care-about-knowledge-sharing-3ilg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reviewpad/why-developers-should-care-about-knowledge-sharing-3ilg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing knowledge usually comes as the last step of a process, or even worse, as something optional, that can be passed on if need be. This makes it easy to skip on this step if you feel you’re tired, or your team is busy. Developers are almost always creating new technologies and figuring out new solutions. Odds are, whatever knowledge you acquire won’t be available anywhere else. The time has come to remind everyone of the fundamental benefits of making whatever knowledge you’ve acquired available to your colleagues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-it-helps-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why it helps you
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge sharing is &lt;a href="https://codingsans.com/state-of-software-development-2020"&gt;the second biggest problem software companies face&lt;/a&gt;. It affects everyone, so it also affects anyone. With the advent of remote work, this issue may become even more important. First of all, let’s appeal to our own self-interest. Sharing knowledge doesn’t only help our team, it actually helps those who are imparting the knowledge in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You are &lt;strong&gt;advancing your own knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. By explaining what you’ve learnt to someone else, you are consolidating what you’ve learnt. You will retain it better, systematise it better, and, frankly, you’ll probably advance it by seeing it through others’ eyes. You will have to consider what you’re sharing and think twice about it. That reflection will bring with it valuable learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You will be &lt;strong&gt;receiving feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. No developer is an island. We learn from others. By sharing what you’ve learnt, you will be receiving other people’s thoughts on the subject, which will surely advance your own understanding. Maybe they will even correct some aspect of it that you misunderstood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You will &lt;strong&gt;help future you&lt;/strong&gt;. If you learn something and just file it away in the caverns of a closed pull request, odds are you may not remember it fully whenever you bump into the same problem again. If you write it down, though, and teach it to others, it will be right there for you when you need it. It’s the easiest way to &lt;strong&gt;only solve problems once&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You will be &lt;strong&gt;advancing your career&lt;/strong&gt;. Sharing knowledge and contributing to the team’s success does not go unnoticed. If when people are in trouble and seek solutions your name pops up all the time, everyone will take notice. This is how promotions happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-it-helps-your-team"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why it helps your team
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sharing isn’t just about oneself, now is it? There must be advantages for the whole team. Let’s see what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  It helps &lt;strong&gt;build team spirit&lt;/strong&gt;. This may sound like a meaningless phrase, but it isn’t. What goes around comes around, and a team that is accustomed to helping each other will resort to helping each other naturally. Giving everyone a hand shouldn’t be contingent on someone being in trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You will be &lt;strong&gt;saving everyone A LOT of time&lt;/strong&gt;. How long did it take you to solve the problem? An hour? Two? A whole day? Whenever someone on your team runs into the exact same issue, they will (depending on skill level or just sheer instinct) take roughly the same amount of time. If there’s an explanation available, though, that everyone has knowledge of… Not so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  You will be &lt;strong&gt;building a knowledge base&lt;/strong&gt;. It may seem like just a small addition, but small additions build up. If your team develops a culture of sharing knowledge, they will inevitably create a repository that will become a cornerstone of success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-do-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to do it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, are there any best practices, aside from simply gathering the team and telling them, or writing stuff down somewhere public, such as an internal Wiki?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have some ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If you’re using &lt;strong&gt;Reviewpad&lt;/strong&gt;, which you should, the &lt;em&gt;Comments from the Past&lt;/em&gt; feature makes it so whenever someone touches code with comments, they’ll be able to see what was shared when that code was made. Forget about re-working the same problems, or going down avenues that somebody else already found out that don’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Whenever a team member explains something to you, &lt;strong&gt;encourage them to document it&lt;/strong&gt;. If it was useful to you, it will likely be useful to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Much in the same way, whenever someone asks you for help, &lt;strong&gt;document it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Whenever you are the one who needs an explanation, avoid asking in private. &lt;strong&gt;Ask on a public forum&lt;/strong&gt;, so everyone can read the discussion and take advantage of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make it &lt;strong&gt;easily accessible&lt;/strong&gt;. Your knowledge base needs to be freely and easily accessible to everyone, at all times. Developers don’t particularly like over complicated wikis, so it’s up to you to create this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why we are building Reviewpad is making knowledge sharing easier and more convenient to everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewpad is about communication as much as it is about reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reviewpad.com/get-started"&gt;Are you ready to give it a go?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, what is Docker? The Docker Engine is a virtualization platform and service that deploys and runs apps in containers.  That's a common, concise, and yet very esoteric description.  In order to try and explain this description of Docker, some basics of how a program is installed and run must first be covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, whether the operating system on a host machine is Windows, MacOS, or Linux, when the user needs to use a certain app or software they must first download and install that app.  There are many ways to do this, but the most simple and common way is to download the app directly to your hard drive.  The installation process is slightly different depending on the operating system, but installing it will put the main program in your operating system's directory for programs, and a bunch of other supporting files throughout your entire file system.  To run an app in this simple setup, the operating system then dedicates specified amounts of resources like RAM, CPU, and additional hard drive space. For all the above processes to work, the installer or package manager must know which files must go where, and the app itself must be able to communicate directly to the operating system.  The more accessible a development team wants their app to be, the more operating systems they have to program for.  The more operating systems they program for, the more file systems they have to account for.  To deal with this growing complexity in both the development and deployment of the app, virtualization can be used. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y4mVNPzJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lqh3hs5hhr0g30mg4u1b.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y4mVNPzJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lqh3hs5hhr0g30mg4u1b.jpg" alt="Virtual Machine Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a traditional Virtual Machine, an app can be written for use in one operating system but used on a host machine that has a different operating system installed and running.  For example, a machine running Windows can run a program that needs to run in a Linux operating system by using a hypervisor like WSL to translate between the two operating systems.  Additional Virtual Machines can be generated for how many different types of operating systems that are needed.  Unfortunately, this has downsides as each additional Virtual Machine is a whole new operating system that uses redundant files and each app has to get two operating systems to agree on how much resources it can be allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I54u0Wtz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eijpohr4ckov0lbkamip.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I54u0Wtz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eijpohr4ckov0lbkamip.jpg" alt="Docker Platform and Containers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Docker and its containers comes in.  Containers are environments in the Docker Engine where the app and all its supporting files resides all in one place.  The Docker Engine also talks directly to the host machine's operating system to allocate a fixed amount of resources to each container.  The main benefit of the fixed resource allocation is stability as the app should always have enough; the downside is that if it is allocated too much, those resources will be wasted and unusable by the host machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Docker is run natively in Linux.  When run on a Linux operating system, Docker can talk directly to the kernel in resource requests.  This direct connection saves additional resources and time.  When Docker is run on MacOS or Windows, it is run much like a Virtual Machine in that the Docker Engine must talk to a hypervisor first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8iB7XhFt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f68lc1cc0iwnoquxqnrb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8iB7XhFt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f68lc1cc0iwnoquxqnrb.png" alt="The Office meme"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, because everything the apps need are in the containers, docker simplifies many of the processes to develop and deploy said apps. The apps should be more stable since it has a fixed amount of resources reserved for it. Using Docker on a Linux machine can save additional resources by not having to use a hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A deep dive into Javascript Object properties</title>
      <author>Mustapha Aouas</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:40:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mustapha/a-deep-dive-into-javascript-object-properties-598h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mustapha/a-deep-dive-into-javascript-object-properties-598h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a dive to see how objects are created then we'll talk about some interesting properties of object’s properties, but first let's start by taking a look at how we usually create an objects using object literals:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have created an object containing a property &lt;code&gt;numberplate&lt;/code&gt; with a value of &lt;code&gt;'1234'&lt;/code&gt;. Behind the scene javascipt is using &lt;code&gt;Object.create&lt;/code&gt; method to create this object. This is how it looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prototype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;enumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;configurable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The two snippets of code above are absolutely equivalent and you can see why we use object literals, but let's take a moment to understand what is happening in the second snippet.&lt;br&gt;
As a first argument the &lt;code&gt;Object.create&lt;/code&gt; takes the object which should be the prototype of the newly-created object, since we don't have/want any prototypal inheritance, we specify that it should take the default object prototype.&lt;br&gt;
More interestingly, the second argument specify the property descriptors to be added to the newly-created object, with the corresponding property names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you can also use &lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperties&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperty&lt;/code&gt; to specify property descriptors for any given object. More on it &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see what each property descriptor is responsible of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#property-descriptors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Property descriptors
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;writable&lt;/code&gt; property descriptor defines whether the property (in this case &lt;code&gt;numberplate&lt;/code&gt;) value can be changed from its initial value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; Uncaught TypeError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if you don't use strict mode (with &lt;code&gt;'use strict'&lt;/code&gt;)  in the exemple above, the interpreter will not throw an error and the value will not be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat to be aware of. The &lt;code&gt;writable&lt;/code&gt; property descriptor stops the pointer of the property from moving. that means if the property points toward an object, the members of that object can still be changed, for exemple:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;writable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; '0000'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; Uncaught TypeError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enumerable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enumerable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default object properties are enumerable, so we can enumerate over them with &lt;code&gt;for...in&lt;/code&gt; loops and we can get them as an array with &lt;code&gt;Object.keys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the difference between these two ways of getting the enumerable properties is that &lt;code&gt;Object.keys&lt;/code&gt; returns only an array with the own properties of the object, while the &lt;code&gt;for...in&lt;/code&gt; loop returns also the keys found in the prototype chain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;brand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Koenigsegg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;enumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; [brand]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;enumerable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; will also affect the &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; serialisation of the property as it won't be serialised. That can be useful in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configurable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configurable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;configurable&lt;/code&gt; descriptor of a property prevents the descriptors (of that given property ex: &lt;code&gt;platenumber&lt;/code&gt;) from being changed. Also it prevents the property from being deleted from the object. Let's see an exemple:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;configurable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; Uncaught TypeError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;enumerable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; Uncaught TypeError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;configurable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; Uncaught TypeError&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you set the configurable descriptor of a property to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, you can not switch it back to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat to be aware of is that even if you set &lt;code&gt;configurable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, you still can change the &lt;code&gt;writable&lt;/code&gt; descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Value
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the value descriptor is here to set or change the value of the property.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;use strict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numberplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; '0000'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setter-and-getter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setter and getter
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getters
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another useful thing you could also do with &lt;code&gt;Object.create&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperty&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperties&lt;/code&gt;) is implementing setters and getters. Let's see how we can do it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; [0, 0]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To create a getter, you set the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; attribute to a function, this function is our getter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setters
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defineProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pointArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pointArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Like we did for the getter, to implement a setter we set the &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; attribute to a function that takes an argument, the argument is the value you want to set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when you set a getter or setter for a property, it can't have a writable or a value property descriptor. See below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getOwnPropertyDescriptor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// -&amp;gt; { enumerable: false,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//      configurable: false,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//      get: ƒ, set: ƒ }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that when you set a getter or a setter, the &lt;code&gt;enumerable&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;configurable&lt;/code&gt; descriptors are automatically set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. So you may want to set the getters and the setters in the same expression, or manually set &lt;code&gt;configurable&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; while implementing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>5 Tips to Scale your App</title>
      <author>Aidan Gee</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:34:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aidangee/5-tips-to-scale-your-app-11ck</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aidangee/5-tips-to-scale-your-app-11ck</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Original Post: &lt;a href="https://aidangee.dev/blog/5-tips-to-help-scale-your-app-scale"&gt;https://aidangee.dev/blog/5-tips-to-help-scale-your-app-scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your multichannel application to grow and have more users. But as this grows you will need to be able to handle the increased traffic whilst also balancing the cost of infrastructure. If you get that big brand customer you don't want them to take down your service for themselves and other customers! (seen this first hand!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick solution is often to vertically or horizontally scale the compute, but costs can quickly get out of control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked on both small and extremely high traffic applications and wanted to share some techniques I have seen successfully used.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-serverless"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Serverless
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serverless Architecture is ideal for allowing an initially small web application to scale over time. Serverless infrastructure is both auto-scaling and pay per use. So whilst your app is small you will not need to pay for idle compute costs and when the time comes you have the capacity for significant growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fits well with applications that have a 'spikey' traffic pattern. For example ticket sales or product launches, in these use cases the user traffic is generally condensed into a short window of time and serverless compute like lambda or cloud functions allow for the instant scale needed to support this. Whilst keeping costs low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't just end with compute, there is a growing number of serverless database solutions as well. DynamoDB, MongoDB, FaunaDB, Aurora these all offer a serverless way to store your data. Meaning there is little to no infrastructure for you to worry about managing across your stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of a Serverless Application built on top of AWS:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cuSYsdhP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/Serverless_Architecture.5434f715486a0bdd5786cd1c084cd96efa82438f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cuSYsdhP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/Serverless_Architecture.5434f715486a0bdd5786cd1c084cd96efa82438f.png" alt="AWS Serverless stack diagram" title="AWS Serverless Stack from https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to check out: &lt;a href="https://www.serverless.com/"&gt;Serverless Framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions"&gt;Cloud Functions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/run"&gt;Cloud Run&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-client-side-rendering-prerendering-hybrid"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Client side rendering / Pre-rendering / Hybrid
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the user experience you need to provide and your SEO requirements, the way you render your UI can make a big difference to how your application scales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your application is purely server side rendered, it might be worth asking yourself the question "does it need to be?". Moving some server-side work to the user's browser or pre-rendering it at build time could save on some resources. For example, in the past I have moved an e-commerce website's checkout process to an SPA which cut down the traffic hitting their web servers on average by 30%. This made a big difference to infrastructure costs and scale at high traffic events. With little change to the users experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a varied subject based on your use case, I have written a &lt;a href="https://aidangee.dev/blog/quick-tip-javascript-rendering"&gt;whole post on rendering options with JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres also a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o"&gt;fantastic talk&lt;/a&gt; recently from Rich Harris (Svelte Maintainer) on the trade-offs between server rendering and SPA's. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-queues-amp-asynchronous-workers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Queues &amp;amp; Asynchronous Workers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queues and background workers can help improve the scalability of your application by offloading slow or intensive tasks. This is commonly by decoupling a user action from some processing that could cause a backlog and effect performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some common examples of this might be uploading an image, generating a report or processing a video. If we take the example of generating a report for a large dataset, this might take a few minutes for a user. You do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want this process using up a large amount of resources and holding open connections on the same infrastructure that is dealing with the requests of your other users. You risk an extra large report or a few reports running simultaneously to start effecting performance or cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting this work to the background can allow this to be dealt with predictably. Sending these requests to a queue that can push (or pull) the work to a set of worker processes allows you to control the scaling of infrastructure and not risk the affecting other requests coming in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to check out: &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"&gt;AWS SQS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/tasks"&gt;Cloud Tasks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://render.com/docs/background-workers"&gt;render.com background workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/background-jobs-queueing"&gt;Heroku workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/gocraft/work"&gt;Go Worker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-spot-preemptible-instances"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Spot / Preemptible Instances
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have auto-scaling servers, costs can quickly rack up as you grow. Spot instances (&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible"&gt;preemptible VMs on GCP&lt;/a&gt;) make use of unused compute for upto 90% savings on the usual on-demand price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating with spot instances has been made much easier the past year or so with integrations with EC2 auto-scaling and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html"&gt;Spot fleet&lt;/a&gt;. But there can still be some responsibility to handle interruptions and rebalancing if your application is not 'fault-tolerant'. To take away these concerns services like &lt;a href="https://spot.io/solutions/amazon-web-services/"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt; can guarantee a high availability and abstract away some of the complexities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to check out: &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/"&gt;Spot intances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible"&gt;Preemptible VM instances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-event-driven-architecture"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Event Driven Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications usually start with monolithic design. A singular running process to do everything from logging &amp;amp; metrics to sending emails. If part of that fails, or you get a long running task, then this could clog up the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An event driven approach allows you to decouple these different pieces into seperate services that can scale &amp;amp; fail independently of one another. This system uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y96f34Ir--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/wubo/image/upload/f_auto/v1634050228/blog/simple-event-driven-architecture-diagram_zsgrmg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y96f34Ir--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/wubo/image/upload/f_auto/v1634050228/blog/simple-event-driven-architecture-diagram_zsgrmg.png" alt="A simple example of event driven architecture"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to check out: &lt;a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/AWS-Learning-Path-How-to-Use-Amazon-EventBridge-to-Build-Decoupled-Event-Driven-Architectures_2020_LP_0001-SRV.html"&gt;AWS video series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""&gt;Event Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs/overview%5D"&gt;Eventarc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-monitoring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus: Monitoring!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I think is often overlooked is the power of performance monitoring. How do you know if a new release is using significantly more resources, is it from your metrics or when you get the big infrastructure bill at the end of the month?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres a ton of Application monitoring solutions out there with integrations for all types of languages. &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com/"&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/"&gt;DataDog&lt;/a&gt; are 2 popular examples. They allow you to get much more fined grained than just CPU, Memory usage &amp;amp; scaling. You can see information such as :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External API performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code-level visibility e.g. inspecting a particular methods performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traces for slow performing request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And way more !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance monitoring can help you stay scalable whilst you continue to make changes. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running out of memory when running `craco build` on bitbucket pipline</title>
      <author>Theivendram Athavan</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:21:17 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aaketk17/running-out-of-memory-when-running-craco-build-on-bitbucket-pipline-1j00</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bljvRFby--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ri2d5qo4p11sdn3klxha.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bljvRFby--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ri2d5qo4p11sdn3klxha.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got this error when deploying the branch in gitlab. changes made before the deployment were ( in package.json )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"scripts": {&lt;br&gt;
"start": "craco start",&lt;br&gt;
"build": "craco build",&lt;br&gt;
"test": "craco test",&lt;br&gt;
"eject": "react-scripts eject",&lt;br&gt;
"format": "prettier --write src/&lt;strong&gt;/*.ts{,x}",&lt;br&gt;
"lint": "tsc --noEmit &amp;amp;&amp;amp; eslint src/&lt;/strong&gt;/*.ts{,x}"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;},&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;later fixed this error by modifying the above script as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"scripts": {&lt;br&gt;
    "start": "craco --max_old_space_size=4096 start",&lt;br&gt;
    "build": "craco --max_old_space_size=4096 build",&lt;br&gt;
    "test": "craco test",&lt;br&gt;
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",&lt;br&gt;
    "format": "prettier --write src/&lt;strong&gt;/*.ts{,x}",&lt;br&gt;
    "lint": "tsc --noEmit &amp;amp;&amp;amp; eslint src/&lt;/strong&gt;/*.ts{,x}"&lt;br&gt;
  },&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;am new to craco. I have used craco to customize the antd theme and followed the guidelines mention in their documentation. later on, I went through the usage of craco but still, I don't have complete knowledge in craco. I need some explanation why it has not given an error without craco and it's giving an error when using craco. so does this mean craco will consume more memory than using react-script start&lt;/p&gt;

  October 18th, 2021 - Instalment #86
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsletter #86.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we have a very broad variety of topics. Starting off with some fresh open source projects such as cfn-diagram, aws-jwt-verify, damo, aws-dotnet-deploy, automated-account-configuration, BayerCLAW and more. For mains, we have new AWS and community authored posts on MySQL, OpenSearch, .NET, miniwdl, OpenMRS, Apache Hudi, Apache Spark, ROS, cdk8s, Jax, Deep Graph Library and more. Finally, for pudding we have this weeks video that provides an insight into contributing to Apache Airflow and we have some new events added so check those out and add them to your diary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aws-dotnet-deploy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/b7"&gt;aws-dotnet-deploy&lt;/a&gt; this repository contains the AWS .NET deployment tool for .NET CLI - the opinionated tooling that simplifies deployment of .NET applications with minimum AWS knowledge. The tool suggests the right AWS compute service to deploy your application to. It then builds and packages your application as required by the chosen compute service, generates the deployment infrastructure, deploys your application by using the Cloud Development Kit (CDK), and displays the endpoint. Norm Johanson has put together a couple of blog posts. First we have &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/102"&gt;Update on our new AWS .NET Deployment Experience&lt;/a&gt; which provides you with an update of the recent updates to this project. Following that we have &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/zz"&gt;Deployment Projects with the new AWS .NET Deployment Experience&lt;/a&gt; that walks you through a new feature of this project, deployment projects[hands on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.NET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague François Bouteruche is back with another instalment of the story of My Local Farmer, a fictional company inspired by customer interactions with AWS Solutions Architects. This episode, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/108"&gt;Migrating our trusty ol’ .NET Framework applications to AWS, I couldn’t believe it!&lt;/a&gt; takes a look at a number of open source projects you can use to help move your .NET workloads over to AWS. Tres bien!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cdk8s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect timing with Kubecon last week, was Eddie Zaneski in his post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/106"&gt;Announcing the general availability of cdk8s and support for Go&lt;/a&gt;. For those who may not be familiar with cdk8s, this is a CNCF Sandbox project, an open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications using general-purpose programming languages. The output of a CDK8s program is Kubernetes YAML that you can apply directly to any cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohin Bhargava, Gopala Krishna, and Saikumar Karanam provide a brief overview of the cross-cluster replication feature within OpenSearch, and the thought process behind the design and implementation. Read on in &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/107"&gt;Introduction to Cross-Cluster Replication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research. In this post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/105"&gt;Train and deploy deep learning models using JAX with Amazon SageMaker&lt;/a&gt; Archis Joglekar and Sean Morgan show how you can utilise the Bring Your Own Container (BYOC) paradigm to train ML models on GPUs using the increasingly popular JAX library from Google. As a bonus, the post shows how to serialise trained models into the TensorFlow SavedModel format so that we can use the existing TensorFlow Serving infrastructure provided by SageMaker. [hands on]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Graph Library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Avilez and Tim Pavlick from HawkEye 360 provide some insights in how they are using the open source Deep Graph Library and Amazon Neptune to find risks for nearby ships in the post &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/10j"&gt;HawkEye 360 predicts vessel risk using the Deep Graph Library and Amazon Neptune&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;miniwdl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to specify data processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. WDL makes it straightforward to define analysis tasks, chain them together in workflows, and parallelise their execution. miniwdl is a local runner and developer toolkit for the bioinformatics-focused Workflow Description Language (WDL). In the blog post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/103"&gt;Using miniwdl, GWFCore, and SageMaker Studio as a cloud IDE for genomics workflows&lt;/a&gt; written by Mike Lin and Lee Pang, will show you how you can combine these open source tools together with AWS to build workflows and manage ad hoc analysis runs.&lt;/p&gt;

  Open Data
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst not open source, open data sets help democratise access to data by making it available to the public for analysis on AWS; develop new cloud-native techniques, formats, and tools that lower the cost of working with data; and encourage the development of communities that benefit from access to shared datasets. In the post, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/10k"&gt;Climate data, koala genomes, analysis ready radar data, and highly-queryable genomic data: The latest open data on AWS&lt;/a&gt; Joe Flasher shares 26 new data sets released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EMR 6.4 release version now supports Apache Spark 3.1.2 and provides runtime improvements with Amazon EMR Runtime for Apache Spark. Amazon EMR 6.4 provides Presto runtime improvements for PrestoDB 0.254, and runtime improvements for Apache Hive 3.1.2 when you use AWS Glue Data Catalog for your metastore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EMR 6.4 supports Apache Hudi 0.8.0, Trino 359, PrestoDB 0.254, Apache HBase 2.4.4, Apache Phoenix 5.1.2, Apache Flink 1.13.1, Apache Livy 0.7.1, JupyterHub 1.4.1, Apache Zookeeper 3.5.7 and Apache MXNet 1.8.0. Please see our release guide to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ActiveMQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now launch Apache ActiveMQ 5.16.3 brokers on Amazon MQ. This version update to ActiveMQ contains several fixes and improvements compared to the previously supported version, ActiveMQ 5.16.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS CDK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During September, 2021, 5 new versions of the AWS Cloud Development Kit  (CDK) for JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, .NET and Go were released (v1.121.0 through v.125.0). With these releases, the CDK CLI now has support for hotswap deployments for faster inner-loop development iterations on the application code in your CDK project. Hotswap initially supports AWS Lambda handler code, but support is planned for additional resource types and a “watch” mode which continually watches for changes and deploys any updates. Additionally, users can preserve successfully provisioned resources by disabling automatic stack rollbacks, further reducing deployment and iteration time. These releases also resolve 21 issues and introduce 40 new features that span over 30 different modules across the library. Many of these changes were contributed by the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the full release notes for &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/zt"&gt;1.121.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/zu"&gt;1.122.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/zv"&gt;1.123.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/zw"&gt;1.124.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/zx"&gt;1.125.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS RoboMaker, a service that allows customers to simulate robotics applications at cloud scale, now supports GPU based simulation jobs for compute-intensive simulation workloads such as high fidelity simulation, vision processing, and machine learning (ML). Previously, AWS RoboMaker simulation jobs ran only on central processing unit (CPU) instances; now you can choose between a CPU based or GPU based simulation job. Developers can run, scale, and automate GPU based simulations. GPU based simulations support higher frames-per-second, higher resolutions, lower sensor latencies, and faster simulation job completion times than CPU based simulation jobs. These capabilities enable improved sensing by cameras and realistic rendering needed for use cases such as ML model training, reinforcement learning, and testing use cases that require high fidelity simulations. When running a GPU based simulation job, the AWS RoboMaker GUI tool viewer now supports higher resolutions, enabling you to see simulated objects in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new, AWS RoboMaker now supports expanded configuration for any robot and simulation software. Previously Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo are the only supported robot and simulation software configuration in RoboMaker. This new feature enables customers to use and configure any robot and simulation software of their choice while running simulations in RoboMaker. To use this feature, you select General software suite for Robot application and Simulation runtime for Simulation Application. By choosing the Simulation Runtime configuration, RoboMaker bypasses validations for any specific robot or simulation software, and provides generic simulation features such as sourcing files to the simulation environment, logging, launching simulation tools, and streaming tool GUIs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build an Ecommerce Store with Next.js, Auth0 and Cloudinary</title>
      <author>nefejames</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:14:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hackmamba/build-an-ecommerce-store-with-nextjs-auth0-and-cloudinary-dgo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hackmamba/build-an-ecommerce-store-with-nextjs-auth0-and-cloudinary-dgo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multimedia content optimization is the process of delivering high-quality media files in the right dimension, size, and format without sacrificing quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When poorly optimized, the images and videos in your websites can lead to a poor user experience, loss of traffic, and low SEO rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will learn how Cloudinary enables us to serve fast-loading images and videos through their CDN. We will also learn to set up user authentication with Auth0 and create responsive components with Chakra UI. We will combine these technologies to develop an eCommerce application.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We completed the project demo in &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/broken-wood-4vb7o"&gt;a codesandbox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the deployed version &lt;a href="https://hackmamba-project-19or6wbnq-nefejames.vercel.app/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the codebase in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/nefejames/hackmamba-project"&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisitesinstallation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites/Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having some knowledge of and experience with, React.js and Chakra UI are required to follow the steps in this article. We will use the images and videos hosted on &lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/"&gt;Cloudinary&lt;/a&gt; so you will need a &lt;a href="https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free"&gt;Cloudinary account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/"&gt;Auth0&lt;/a&gt; will handle the user authentication through their &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/docs/login/universal-login"&gt;universal login&lt;/a&gt; service, so you must &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/signu%20p"&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, we will be using Next.js in this project, so we need to &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-ap"&gt;scaffold a new Next.js application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also use the following packages in the application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-react"&gt;cloudinary-react&lt;/a&gt;’s Video component to display videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0"&gt;Auth0’s Next.js SDK&lt;/a&gt; to handle the user authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui"&gt;Chakra UI&lt;/a&gt; to create the user interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We install the required packages in our application using the CLI command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i chakra-ui cloudinary-react auth0/nextjs-auth0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-homepage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the Homepage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homepage consists of a header and a hero section; the header consists of the logo and a login/sign-in button, and the hero consists of the website copy on the left and an image on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see the appearance of the homepage in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jp8p1A9b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D65A090A5542872AAE6A8DDDEE64FCB43060C51AA27CE7D7D1C131AFDB8E304B_1632582978011_homepage.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jp8p1A9b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D65A090A5542872AAE6A8DDDEE64FCB43060C51AA27CE7D7D1C131AFDB8E304B_1632582978011_homepage.PNG" alt="PetShop Homepage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by creating the layout for the homepage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { Box, Container } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import HomeHeader from "@components/Headers/Home";

    export default function HomeLayout({ children }) {
      return (
        &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Container maxW={"7xl"}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;HomeHeader /&amp;gt;

            {children}
          &amp;lt;/Container&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the homepage layout, we create a component, &lt;code&gt;HomeLayout&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;HomeLayout&lt;/code&gt; consists of a &lt;code&gt;HomeHeader&lt;/code&gt; component and the children we will pass into it later. &lt;code&gt;HomeLayout&lt;/code&gt; is where the hero section will sit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Homepage Header&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Next, we create the homepage header.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import NextLink from "next/link";
    import { Box, Flex, Button } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import Logo from "@svgs/Logo";

    export default function HomeHeader() {
      return (
        &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Flex&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;NextLink href="/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Logo /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/NextLink&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Flex&amp;gt;      
        &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;HomeHeader&lt;/code&gt; component is made up of the Logo. We will add a login button later in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Hero Section&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now, we move on to the hero section.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { Stack, Flex, Box, Heading, Text, Image } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import HomeLayout from "@layout/Home";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        &amp;lt;HomeLayout&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Stack&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Stack flex={1} spacing={{ base: 5, md: 10 }}&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Heading lineHeight={1.1} fontWeight={600} fontSize={["3xl", "4xl", "6xl"]}
              &amp;gt;
                Get your perfect companion{" "}
                &amp;lt;Text as="span" color="blue.500"&amp;gt;
                  today!
                &amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/Heading&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Text color="gray.200" fontSize={["lg"]}&amp;gt;
                Buyng a pet is a big decision, and we are here to help you through
                the process. It's time to add a new love to your family. Discover
                the right pet for you. It's time to find your new best friend.
              &amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Flex&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Image alt="Hero Image" fit="cover" align="center" w="100%" h="100%"
                  src=" https://res.cloudinary.com/nefejames/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_auto/v1632501665/Hackmamba/Images/hero.jpg"
                /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Flex&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/HomeLayout&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hero image is gotten from our Cloudinary media repository. Let’s breakdown the URL of the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;q_auto&lt;/code&gt;: produces a high quality image with a minimal the file size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;f_auto&lt;/code&gt;: delivers the image in the best format supported by the browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;w_auto&lt;/code&gt;: serves images proportional to users’ device resolution and screen sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-dashboard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the Dashboard
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard consists of a header, sidebar, and dashboard view that contains the products.&lt;br&gt;
The header consists of the logo and a button to toggle the sidebar.&lt;br&gt;
The sidebar consists of a link to illustrate how a dashboard looks in a full-scale application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by creating the layout of the dashboard.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { useMediaQuery, Box, Stack } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import Header from "@components/Headers/Dashboard/";
    import Page from "./Page";
    import { DesktopSidebar, MobileSidebar } from "@components/DashboardSidebar";

    export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
      const [isSmallScreen] = useMediaQuery("(max-width: 768px)");

      return (
        &amp;lt;Box w="full"&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Header /&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Box pos="relative" h="max-content"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Stack direction="row" spacing={{ md: 5 }}&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;DesktopSidebar /&amp;gt;
              {isSmallScreen &amp;amp;&amp;amp; &amp;lt;MobileSidebar /&amp;gt;}
              &amp;lt;Page&amp;gt;{children}&amp;lt;/Page&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dashboard layout consists of two dashboards, a mobile dashboard, and another for desktops.&lt;br&gt;
We create a &lt;code&gt;DashboardLayout&lt;/code&gt; component and use Chakra’s &lt;code&gt;[useMediaQuery](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-media-query)&lt;/code&gt; hook to set up a &lt;code&gt;isSmallScreen&lt;/code&gt; boolean. We show the mobile sidebar when &lt;code&gt;isSmallScreen&lt;/code&gt; is true - when the max-width is 768px.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dashboard Context and Interactivity Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before we continue building the dashboard, we need to understand its flow. We want to add some interactivity to the dashboard to boost the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to toggle the width of the desktop sidebar. We also want the mobile sidebar to slide in and out when toggled.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core aspect of this functionality is a sidebar context, which we will create. The value of the sidebar context is gotten from Chakra UI’s &lt;code&gt;[useDisclosure](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-disclosure)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-disclosure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;hook. &lt;code&gt;useDisclosure&lt;/code&gt; is a custom hook used to help handle common open, close, or toggle scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When setting up the sidebar, we will create and export a &lt;code&gt;useSidebarAuth&lt;/code&gt; hook that consumes the sidebar context and makes its values accessible throughout the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will pass the &lt;code&gt;useSidebarAuth&lt;/code&gt; hook to a &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; component which we will create later. &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; will enable us to toggle the sidebar context’s &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt; value when clicked. We will pass &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; to the dashboard header later.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever a user clicks the &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt;, we alter the behavior of the desktop or mobile sidebars based on the current value of &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow chart image below shows us how the sidebar context works with the dashboard components and how we will set up the interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5YsxVirp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D65A090A5542872AAE6A8DDDEE64FCB43060C51AA27CE7D7D1C131AFDB8E304B_1632614220694_Untitled%2BDiagram.drawio1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5YsxVirp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D65A090A5542872AAE6A8DDDEE64FCB43060C51AA27CE7D7D1C131AFDB8E304B_1632614220694_Untitled%2BDiagram.drawio1.png" alt="dashboard context and interactivity flow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Sidebar Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the sidebar context and how it is used in the dashboard, let us set up the context.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { createContext, useContext } from "react";
    import { useDisclosure } from "@chakra-ui/react";

    const SidebarContext = createContext(null);
    export const useSidebarAuth = () =&amp;gt; useContext(SidebarContext);

    export default function SidebarContextProvider({ children }) {
      const sidebarState = useDisclosure();

      return (
        &amp;lt;SidebarContext.Provider value={sidebarState}&amp;gt;
          {children}
        &amp;lt;/SidebarContext.Provider&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, we use the &lt;code&gt;useDisclosure&lt;/code&gt; hook to set up the context and export a &lt;code&gt;useSidebarAuth&lt;/code&gt; hook that consumes the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Sidebar Toggle Button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The next thing we need to do is create the  &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { Icon, IconButton } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import { CgClose, CgMenu } from "react-icons/cg";
    import { useSidebarAuth } from "@context/sidebarContext";

    export default function SidebarToggleButton() {
      const { onToggle, isOpen } = useSidebarAuth();
      const icon = isOpen ? CgClose : CgMenu;
      return (
        &amp;lt;IconButton
          size="sm"
          fontSize="lg"
          variant="ghost"
          onClick={onToggle}
          icon={&amp;lt;Icon as={icon} /&amp;gt;}
          aria-label="Toggle Actions"
          transition="all .4s ease-in-out"
        /&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, when &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; is clicked, the &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt; value of the context is toggled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Dashboard Header&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Next we set up the dashboard header.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import NextLink from "next/link";
    import { Flex, Spacer, Stack, Button, Link } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import SidebarToggleButton from "./components/SidebarToggleButton";
    import Logo from "@svgs/Logo";

    export default function DashboardHeader() {
      return (
        &amp;lt;Flex
          h="10vh"
          minH="70px"
          pos="sticky"
          top="0"
          zIndex="2"
        &amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Stack direction="row" w="full" alignItems="center" spacing="8"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;NextLink href="/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Logo /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/NextLink&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;SidebarToggleButton /&amp;gt;

          &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Flex&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I explained with the flow chart, we add the &lt;code&gt;SidebarToggleButton&lt;/code&gt; component to the dashboard header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Desktop Sidebar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The dashboard has two sidebars, one for mobile devices, and another for desktop devices. Let’s start with the desktop sidebar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { useRouter } from "next/router";
    import { useSidebarAuth } from "@context/sidebarContext";

    export default function Sidebar() {
      const router = useRouter();

      return (
        &amp;lt;Stack
          minH="full"
          h="90vh"
          pos="sticky"
          top="10vh"
          display={["none", , "initial"]}
          transition="width .4s ease-in-out"
        &amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;NavLink
            active={router.pathname === "/"}
            name="Home"
            href="/"
            icon={IoHomeSharp}
          /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We want the desktop sidebar to be hidden on mobile, so we set the display to none. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Mobile Sidebar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We make use of Chakra’s &lt;code&gt;[Drawer](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/overlay/drawe)&lt;/code&gt; component to set up the mobile sidebar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { useEffect } from "react";
    import { useRouter } from "next/router";
    import {
      Drawer,
      DrawerCloseButton,
      DrawerContent,
      DrawerOverlay,
    } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import { useSidebarAuth } from "@context/sidebarContext";
    import FullNavLink from "./FullNavLink";

    export default function MobileSidebar() {
      const router = useRouter();
      const { isOpen, onClose } = useSidebarAuth();

      useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
        router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", onClose);
        return () =&amp;gt; {
          router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", onClose);
        };
      }, []);
      return (
        &amp;lt;Drawer isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose} placement="left"&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;DrawerOverlay display={["initial", , "none"]}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;DrawerContent layerStyle="neutral" py={12} bg="gray.900"&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Stack spacing={2} fontSize="sm"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;DrawerCloseButton /&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;FullNavLink
                  active={router.pathname === "/"}
                  name="Home"
                  href="/"
                  icon={IoHomeSharp}
                /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/DrawerContent&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/DrawerOverlay&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Drawer&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next.js provides a &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router#routerevents"&gt;router event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;routeChangeComplete&lt;/code&gt;, which we use to toggle the mobile sidebar when a link is clicked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dashboard View&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Before we proceed, we need to break down the dashboard view. The dashboard view consists of the &lt;code&gt;DashboardLayout&lt;/code&gt; component we set up earlier, a grid of products in a &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt; component, and a &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s set up the dashboard view.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { useState } from "react";
    import { Box, SimpleGrid } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import { motion } from "framer-motion";
    import ProductCard from "@components/ProductCard";
    import DashboardLayout from "@layout/Dashboard";
    import ModalProduct from "@components/ModalProduct";
    import data from "@root/data";
    const MotionSimpleGrid = motion(SimpleGrid);
    const MotionBox = motion(Box);

    export default function Dashboard() {
      const [modalData, setModalData] = useState(null);
      return (
        &amp;lt;DashboardLayout&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;MotionSimpleGrid&amp;gt;
              {data.map((product) =&amp;gt; (
                &amp;lt;MotionBox variants={cardVariant} key={product.id}&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;ProductCard product={product} setModalData={setModalData} /&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/MotionBox&amp;gt;
              ))}
            &amp;lt;/MotionSimpleGrid&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ModalProduct
              isOpen={modalData ? true : false}
              onClose={() =&amp;gt; setModalData(null)}
              modalData={modalData}
            /&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/DashboardLayout&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s breakdown the snippet above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We define a &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; state where the data of the clicked product will be stored. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We pass &lt;code&gt;setModalData&lt;/code&gt; and the product data to the &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt; component. We will use this to update the &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; state with the data from the current product being clicked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We pass an &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt; boolean, an &lt;code&gt;onClose&lt;/code&gt; method and and the &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; state to the &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt; component. The value of &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt; depends on the value of &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; is null, then &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt; is false. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt; is clicked, it triggers &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt; and causes &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt; to pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample of the data we map through and pass to &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    const data = [
      {
        title: "First Pet",
        price: 250,
        img: "https://res.cloudinary.com/nefejames/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_auto/Hackmamba/Images/pet1.jpg",
        video: "/Hackmamba/Videos/pet1",
      },
      {
        title: "Second Pet",
        price: 250,
        img: "https://res.cloudinary.com/nefejames/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_auto/Hackmamba/Images/pet2.jpg",
        video: "/Hackmamba/Videos/pet2",
      },
      // other data objects below
    ]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;**ProductCard**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;**ModalProduct**&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now that we understand how &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt; work, let’s create them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with setting up &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import Image from "next/image";
    import { Box, Flex } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import { StarIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons";

    export default function ProductCard({ product, setModalData }) {
      const { img, beds, baths, title, price } = product;
      const score = Math.floor(Math.random(5) * 5);
      const reviewCount = Math.floor(Math.random(50) * 50);

      return (
        &amp;lt;Flex&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Box onClick={() =&amp;gt; setModalData(product)}&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Image
                src={img}
                objectFit="cover"
                alt="picture of an animal"
                layout="fill"
                objectFit="cover"
              /&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;Box p="6"&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt; {title} &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;${price}&amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;

              &amp;lt;Box d="flex" mt="3" alignItems="center"&amp;gt;
                {Array(5)
                  .fill("")
                  .map((_, i) =&amp;gt; (
                    &amp;lt;StarIcon key={i} color={i &amp;lt; score ? "teal.500" : "gray.300"} /&amp;gt;
                  ))}
                &amp;lt;Box as="span" ml="2" color="gray.600" fontSize="sm"&amp;gt;
                  {reviewCount} reviews
                &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Flex&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, we pass &lt;code&gt;setModalData&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt;. When &lt;code&gt;ProductCard&lt;/code&gt; is clicked, the &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; state is updated with the data of the product card that was clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s set up &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt;. To do that we use Chakra UI’s &lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/overlay/modal"&gt;Modal&lt;/a&gt; component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { Modal, ModalOverlay, ModalContent, ModalHeader, ModalFooter, ModalBody,
      ModalCloseButton, Button, useToast } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import { Video } from "cloudinary-react";

    export default function ModalProduct({ isOpen, onClose, modalData }) {
      const { title, price, video } = modalData || {};
      const toast = useToast();

      const handleModalClose = () =&amp;gt; {
        toast({
          title: "Purchase successsful.",
          description: "One more happy pet.",
          status: "success",
          duration: 3000,
          isClosable: true,
        });
        setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
          onClose();
        }, 1000);
      };

      return (
        &amp;lt;Modal isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose} size="xl"&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ModalOverlay /&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ModalContent&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ModalCloseButton /&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ModalHeader&amp;gt;Pet Details&amp;lt;/ModalHeader&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ModalBody&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Box w="full" h="full"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Video controls publicId={video} width={300} crop="scale" /&amp;gt;

                &amp;lt;Box pt="3"&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt; {title} &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
                  ${price}
                &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/ModalBody&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ModalFooter&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;Button onClick={handleModalClose}&amp;gt;
                Purchase
              &amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/ModalFooter&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/ModalContent&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Modal&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we passed &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;onClose&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt; from the dashboard view. In the snippet above, we access them through props. We use &lt;code&gt;isOpen&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onClose&lt;/code&gt; to set up the modal and pass the data from &lt;code&gt;modalData&lt;/code&gt; to the appropriate parts of &lt;code&gt;ModalProduct&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also define a function, &lt;code&gt;handleModalClose&lt;/code&gt;, and pass it to the modal’s purchase button. The &lt;code&gt;handleModalClose&lt;/code&gt; function displays a &lt;a href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/feedback/toast"&gt;success toast&lt;/a&gt; and closes the modal when it is called. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#user-authentication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  User Authentication
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, we will use Auth0 to handle the user authentication in this application. Auth0 has provided &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nextjs-authentication-auth0/"&gt;a guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to work with their Next.js SDK. &lt;br&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;useUser&lt;/code&gt; hook exports two objects, user and error, and an isLoading boolean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; contains information about the authenticated user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;isLoading&lt;/code&gt; to check if the SDK has completed loading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use the &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; object to check if there were any authentication errors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the logged-in user profile in the following parts of our application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the homepage header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dashboard header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Index.js Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When the user logs in from the homepage, we want to redirect them to the dashboard route. We set up a &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; and check if &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; exists. If it does, we redirect the user to the app route.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import { useEffect } from "react";
    import HomePage from "@views/Home";
    import { useUser } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";
    import { useRouter } from "next/router";

    export default function Home() {
      const { user } = useUser();
      const router = useRouter();

      useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
        if (user) {
          router.push("/app");
        }
      }, [user, router]);

      return (
        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Head&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Hackmamba PetShop&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/Head&amp;gt;

          &amp;lt;HomePage /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
      );
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Homepage Header&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here, we conditionally show the logout and login buttons. We show the login button if there is no user and the logout button if there is a logged-in user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import NextLink from "next/link";
    import { Box, Flex, Button } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import Logo from "@svgs/Logo";
    import { useUser } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";

    export default function HomeHeader() {
      const { user, isLoading } = useUser();

      return (
        &amp;lt;Box&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Flex&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;NextLink href="/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Logo /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/NextLink&amp;gt;

            {!isLoading &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !user &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (
              &amp;lt;NextLink href="/api/auth/login" passHref&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Button as="a" bg="blue.700" _hover={{ bg: "blue.900" }}&amp;gt;
                  Sign In/Log in
                &amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/NextLink&amp;gt;
            )}

            {user &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (
              &amp;lt;NextLink href="/api/auth/logout" passHref&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Button as="a" bg="blue.700" _hover={{ bg: "blue.900" }}&amp;gt;
                  Logout
                &amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/NextLink&amp;gt;
            )}
          &amp;lt;/Flex&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Box&amp;gt;
      );
    }

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dashboard Header&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here, we show the logout button when a user is logged in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    import NextLink from "next/link";
    import { Flex, Spacer, Stack, Button, Link } from "@chakra-ui/react";
    import SidebarToggleButton from "./components/SidebarToggleButton";
    import { useUser } from "@auth0/nextjs-auth0";
    import Logo from "@svgs/Logo";

    export default function DashboardHeader() {
      const { user } = useUser();

      return (
        &amp;lt;Flex&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;Stack direction="row" w="full" alignItems="center" spacing="8"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;NextLink href="/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Logo /&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/NextLink&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;SidebarToggleButton /&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;Spacer /&amp;gt;

            {user &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (
              &amp;lt;Link href="/api/auth/logout"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;Button bg="blue.700" _hover={{ bg: "blue.900" }}&amp;gt;Logout&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/Link&amp;gt;
            )}
          &amp;lt;/Stack&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Flex&amp;gt;
      );

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned how to use Auth0, Next.js, Chakra UI, and Cloudinary to create an eCommerce application. We also learned how to add interactivity to our applications and make them responsive with Chakra UI’s &lt;code&gt;useDisclosure&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;useMediaQuery&lt;/code&gt; hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 lines of CSS style for disabled elements.(from Material Design)</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ksengine/5-lines-of-css-style-for-disabled-elementsfrom-material-design-122d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I are creating a form with HTML, sometimes I wanted to disable a text box for users. Here came the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disabled-controls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disabled Controls
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boolean disabled attribute, when present, makes the element not mutable, focusable, or even submitted with the form. The user can neither edit nor focus on the control, nor its form control descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the disabled attribute is specified on a form control, the element and its form control descendants do not participate in constraint validation. Often browsers grey out such controls and it won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#read-only-controls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Read only controls
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;strong&gt;read only&lt;/strong&gt; controls.&lt;br&gt;
The difference between &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;readonly&lt;/code&gt; is that read-only controls can still function and are still focusable, whereas disabled controls can not receive focus and are not submitted with the form and generally do not function as controls until they are enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#required-fields"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Required fields
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; controls.&lt;br&gt;
Because a &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; field cannot have its value changed, &lt;code&gt;required&lt;/code&gt; does not have any effect on inputs with the disabled attribute also specified. Additionally, since the elements become immutable, most other attributes, such as pattern, have no effect, until the control is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The &lt;code&gt;required&lt;/code&gt; attribute is not permitted on inputs with the &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#material-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Material Design
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Material Design is a design language developed by Google in 2014. Expanding on the "cards" that debuted in Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Material Design&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disabled state communicates when a component or element isn’t interactive, and should be deemphasized in a UI. Disabled states are displayed at 38% opacity of the enabled state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disabled states can also indicate they are not interactive through color changes and reduced elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R4JO31xY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZWFDVVYAkiFCGvmxT7PQKKyIQz1l_-QKSeXyCCO96cmmXGsNMOmGFFTHzzA0oweCHYgyGv-iF5LCdqR5nVEPxmuE0FDxlQQbAdCWjg%3Dw1064-v0" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R4JO31xY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZWFDVVYAkiFCGvmxT7PQKKyIQz1l_-QKSeXyCCO96cmmXGsNMOmGFFTHzzA0oweCHYgyGv-iF5LCdqR5nVEPxmuE0FDxlQQbAdCWjg%3Dw1064-v0" alt="(1) Enabled and (2) disabled buttons differentiate through color and elevation changes."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the Materialized disabled CSS snippet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;pointer-events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/ksenginew/embed/abyNJqQ?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all. Enjoy it.&lt;br&gt;
Follow me for more tricks.🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️&lt;br&gt;
Thanks 💖💖💖.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  First experience in Hacktoberfest
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Digital Ocean meeting a long time ago. It was introduced to the event by the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a Software Engineer who loves open source technology. Java and a little javascript are used in coding. I play video games when I'm not working. I love music and I play instruments like guitar and bass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#progress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Progress
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite challenging because the review of my PR's are quite too long to be accepted and some has no labels. I decided to contribute project's that are implemented in Spring Framework after working on snippets for the first week. Most of my contributions are focused on code quality and unit test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions"&gt;
