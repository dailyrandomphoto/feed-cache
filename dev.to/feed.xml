      <title>A microaction graphic novel concept</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was spellbound by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_AD_(comics)"&gt;2000 AD comics&lt;/a&gt;. It had nonlinear narratives, irreverent humour, countercultural leanings, and fantastic stories. It had some exceptional writers and artists such as Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, and Grant Morrison who would go on to create landmark graphic novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't articulate what was so good about the comics at the time, but I just knew it was like nothing else, and I seemed to be the only one that "got it". I always wanted to create something like it myself, but never did. The furthest I got was to draw some of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with 2000 AD, here are a few covers to give you a rough idea. The characters and stories span many genres and have very different tones from comedy to horror, so don't judge it by these covers! üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EDBk8vxI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pzefq5e4opbrjwj5bx1n.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EDBk8vxI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pzefq5e4opbrjwj5bx1n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the evolution of the style. The cheesy jokes remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bilToLg7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kjtwyj27a4hc2ra2jzw2.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bilToLg7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kjtwyj27a4hc2ra2jzw2.jpg" alt="2000 AD cover"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Arthur Ranson did some stunning artwork that I found captivating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--L8tnN18---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07onuydwl2topuf1zzic.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--L8tnN18---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07onuydwl2topuf1zzic.jpeg" alt="2000 AD cover"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you get older, it's hard to hold onto these creative outlets. I stopped reading comics. I stopped drawing. It didn't fit in with my professional life. Since I had no-one to share the interest with, it kind of became an anti-social hobby. So, it slowly disappeared from my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the back of my mind, I said I will come back to graphic novels. I will make time for my own artwork. I thought I could make some digital artwork later, if it was tangentially related to my day job, it could be "practice". That never happened. My day job became architecture and backend development, rather than anything in the realm of graphic design. Zero tangents!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found my way back to graphic novels much later. I started to read them on my ereader. Some of them look great on an eInk screen. I started drawing again. That lead me to learn SVG. I started to do some front-end development and got around to learning animation in CSS and JavaScript, and was surprised by how much is possible in the browser. It was a gradual process, but finally, I had the skills to try something out on the web! And ironically, it took a global pandemic, probably the most anti-social period in recent history, to give me the time to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try out something new. I thought I could try to make a cross-breed (mongrel) for the web - let's call it a "web-based micro-action graphic novel". ü§®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try out 2 things in particular, I wanted to add a brief animation (microaction) to each panel (fill in the blank bits I imagine happening), and auto-scrolling to step through each panel at a particular pace. This is my first effort based on a page from Frank Miller's Sin City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e2PXRzKT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cmy8sc9sd6gayf46kvcp.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e2PXRzKT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cmy8sc9sd6gayf46kvcp.gif" alt="demo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can play with &lt;a href="https://www.roboleary.net/lab/sin-city"&gt;the demo&lt;/a&gt; on my website. Clicking on the page will restart the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I created each panel as a separate SVG. I measured out the space of each panel, so that combining them would be more-or-less a copy-and-paste job later. I used GSAP for the animation, and worked on the animation for each panel separately. Combining the timelines later is simple also. The net result was one SVG and one timeline in the script. I reckon I could make a full-sized graphic novel in less than 2MB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the final panel with CSS animation (rerun it if you missed it). It is a simple animation, but in the aggregate, it is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/robjoeol/embed/rNmjrEL?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me, on and off, 2 to 3 days to complete the page. Using masking for the "blam" text effects was the most time-consuming part. I wasn't sure if it would work the way I wanted, so I had to experiment. Looking at it again now with fresh eyes, I would like to tweak it more! Nothing is ever done I guess, it is merely abandoned. üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the outcome. With the ability to control the speed of the auto-scroll, I would love to read a story this way. It would give me a reason to go through a story twice, it's almost like getting a director's cut of a movie. If you want to read it as a regular comic, you can turn off the animation and auto-scrolling. It's your show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my limited artistic ability, making something similar to Sin City with it's bold, gestalt style would be easiest to pull off. Now, I just need my own story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe, I can make a short story of 20 or so pages. It might take 8 weeks worth of work to complete, but it would be a fufilling project to work on part-time over a longer stretch! üòÖ  Hopefully, some inspiration will come my way! üí°üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, my 8-year old self is proud of me for coming this far. üë¶üôå&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript question #Day 4</title>
      <author>Sooraj S</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 11:48:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/soorajs98/javascript-question-day-4-el6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/soorajs98/javascript-question-day-4-el6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which one is true ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bird&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mouse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Mickey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: &lt;code&gt;mouse.bird.size&lt;/code&gt; is not valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B: &lt;code&gt;mouse[bird.size]&lt;/code&gt; is not valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C: &lt;code&gt;mouse[bird["size"]]&lt;/code&gt; is not valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D: All of them are valid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mouse[bird.size]&lt;/code&gt;: First it evaluates &lt;code&gt;bird.size&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;"small"&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;mouse["small"]&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. &lt;code&gt;mouse&lt;/code&gt; does not have a key called &lt;code&gt;bird&lt;/code&gt;, which means that &lt;code&gt;mouse.bird&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. Then, we ask for the &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; using dot notation: &lt;code&gt;mouse.bird.size&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;mouse.bird&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, we're actually asking &lt;code&gt;undefined.size&lt;/code&gt;. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to &lt;code&gt;Cannot read property "size" of undefined&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>Sooraj S</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 11:43:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/soorajs98/javascript-question-day-3-3ahk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/soorajs98/javascript-question-day-3-3ahk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the output ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;diameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;perimeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;diameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;perimeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;62.83185307179586&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B: &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C: &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;63&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D: &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;63&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the value of &lt;code&gt;diameter&lt;/code&gt; is a regular function, whereas the value of &lt;code&gt;perimeter&lt;/code&gt; is an arrow function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With arrow functions, the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call &lt;code&gt;perimeter&lt;/code&gt;, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no value &lt;code&gt;radius&lt;/code&gt; on that object, which returns &lt;code&gt;NaN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Remote onboarding with the buddy system</title>
      <author>Jelle Smeets</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:45:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/remote-onboarding-with-the-buddy-system-2kfk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/remote-onboarding-with-the-buddy-system-2kfk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can determine how good your documentation is by how fast a new developer is up to speed with your projects. Making sure a new developer feels at home and gets brought up to speed requires time and effort. This can be especially hard in remote times. How can you make sure a new hire does not get lost in the remote onboarding? Simple! Use the buddy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-onboarding-buddy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an onboarding buddy?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An onboarding buddy is a person that is the first point of contact for the new hire. Their primary goal is to make sure the new hire gets all the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important parts of the buddy is being the first point of contact. As a new hire, you have no idea who to contact for what. If you are at the office you can take a walk through the office and meet people. This is more difficult in a remote setting. The buddies goal is to help the new hire with this struggle. Point them to the right people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the duties of a buddy extends from being the point of contact. Making introductions is the next step here. If you have not met any coworkers it can be quite challenging to schedule a meeting with them. As a buddy introduce the new hire to all coworkers they will collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5LoYcdB5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/boddrtj6nq3l1wfg2vaj.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5LoYcdB5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/boddrtj6nq3l1wfg2vaj.jpg" alt="Introductions being made"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Introductions being made&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every business has its own context. For an outsider, some decisions that were made will make no sense. At my current company, we have some terminology that can be quite confusing. New hires usually struggle with this if someone did not explain it properly. Luckily as a buddy, you can provide the business context on why things are the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have the best documentation, new hires will still have questions. Make sure you can explain how the project works. Help them set up their local environments. And guide them towards a beginner-friendly bug ticket to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboarding during a pandemic is more challenging than usual. An onboarding buddy is a great way to make sure a new hire gets all the help and support they need. Or as we say in the Netherlands "A good start is half the work". With an onboarding buddy, you make sure your new hire is set up for success at your company!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I'm Changing How I Review Code</title>
      <author>Dan Goslen</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:43:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dangoslen/i-m-changing-how-i-review-code-328g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dangoslen/i-m-changing-how-i-review-code-328g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a big advocate for code reviews. I've written about my experiences reviewing code, including lists of dos and don'ts, &lt;a href="https://dangoslen.me/blog/surviving-your-first-code-review/"&gt;how to survive your first code review&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://dangoslen.me/blog/whats-the-point-to-code-reviews-anyway/"&gt;why we should review code at all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My views have been mainly shaped by my experience with a particular kind of code review - the pull request. Like many devs, I've grown accustomed to the pull request model to help facilitate reviews. While it isn't perfect, I've always found it to be a great tool and overall an improvement to formal code review processes or reviews over email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, though, I've been seeing thoughts expressing a different sentiment. Many devs are starting to become frustrated with the &lt;a href="https://jessitron.com/2021/03/27/those-pesky-pull-request-reviews/"&gt;pull request model&lt;/a&gt;. There is a sense that pull requests actually might make it &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy to comment on a line of code. This ease might be leading to the conflicts and hyper-zealous commenting that frustrates many in our industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common critique is that the pull requests encourage reviewers to only look at the code. They never even pull down the changes they are reviewing! To be completely transparent, I'm guilty of that myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the article and seeing some related ideas via Twitter, I wondered: are there better ways that I could review code? What could I do differently? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After asking, I've decided to start making some changes in how I review code. They've been helping me recently, so I think they could help you and your team as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#commenting-on-code-vs-collaborating-on-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Commenting on Code vs. Collaborating on Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the top thoughts that made me start questioning how I review code comes from the &lt;a href="https://jessitron.com/2021/03/27/those-pesky-pull-request-reviews/"&gt;article above&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull requests are an improvement on working alone. But not on working together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That struck a chord. Indeed, pull requests &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; the primary way to collaborate with people after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborating on code is vital to a team's ability to maintain a codebase. If a single member of a team is left to write an entire codebase without working with other team members, there is a high probability that the rest of the team won't be able to contribute to it after a while. Worse, if left alone, a single team member might even get things wrong or be unable to solve a problem. Therefore, collaborating early and often is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question that arises is this: how &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; a team collaborate on code? Further, can a team collaborate too early? Too often? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many teams seem to have concluded that a pull request is a great place to have collaboration. I don't think they are wrong. First, a team member feels ready to share a version of their code with the rest of the team for direct feedback. Then, like an author writing a book, they submit it for a first review to get feedback. The rest act as editors, ready to help get the draft ready to print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn't anything wrong with teams seeing pull requests as a place for collaborating. The problem is when teams think collaboration is &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt; only to the code review process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams should be working together on problems, ideas, and code well before code is submitted for review. Mentors should be advising mentees, peers should be offering help to each other, and pair programming or debugging sessions should be routine. If an author were to send the first draft to their editor without disclosing what the book is about, it would make it harder for the editor. The editor now has more they need to understand to give useful feedback. As a result, the publication date is likely to get pushed later than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuine collaboration is more than just leaving a comment or a suggestion. It's discussing alternative solutions, prodding at requirements, and having real-time feedback loops with your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be working towards making this form of collaboration more common within my team. I'm hoping to move us beyond collaboration via comments and get back to real-time collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#run-the-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Run. The. Code.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on and rejecting a pull request without ever running or stepping through the changes made sounds silly when said directly. But many developers - including me! - do this all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As engineers, we shouldn't evaluate code only by how "clean" it is or how wonderfully abstracted it is. Instead, we still need to measure code by how well it does what it is supposed to do - deliver some value when it runs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To drive this point home, when was the last time you looked at Google's source code for Google Search? If you did see it, would it change how well you think it works as a product? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not trying to be hyper-reductionistic here. The quality of code does matter! It should be clean, crisp, mutable, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But part of what makes that code good is how well it solves a problem. Does it do what it needs to do to meet requirements? Will the end product be better? At the least, all code needs to make the end product better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best way to see if the code makes the product better? You have to run it. Treat a pull request as a chance to do a mini-demo of the added or fixed functionality. Use it. Poke at it. Heck, even &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; it yourself! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been incredibly guilty about this. I tend to trust our automation that the code changes produced the desired behavior changes without observing the behavior myself! I want to start changing this and running code more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-navigating-and-less-backseat-driving"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More Navigating and Less Backseat Driving
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a problem (or even a difference of opinion) is spotted in code, it can be easy for a reviewer to recommend a concrete change right then and there. For example, they might include a block of code in their comment or add a GitHub suggestion of their improved implementation. They might even include citations and links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they do this for every issue they see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are times adding such comments can be appropriate, it often can feel like the reviewer is attempting to take control. They are dictating what the code &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be rather than providing feedback on the written code. The reviewer is giving directions as if they were a backseat driver. And no one likes backseat drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great code reviewers know the difference between being a backseat driver and being a navigator. Both give directions, but one has the destination in mind while the other is trying to control the driver. A navigator knows multiple ways to reach a destination, but a backseat driver complains when the driver takes Martin Street instead of Hampton street - it could have saved one whole minute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a navigator look like in a code review? Instead of focusing on how to change the code, they are focused on why the code needs changing. They care more about the final outcome rather than the concrete classes that are written. The navigator is primarily focused on understanding where they need to go and to help them get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be more of a navigator. Not every single detail needs commenting, and not every difference of opinion needs to be shared. I want to review code in such a way that I'm helping rather than controlling.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The goal of all of this is really more than becoming a better code reviewer. It's about becoming a better teammate. Knowledge work isn't just an individual grinding away on an intense thought or task anymore. Knowledge work - or at least meaningful knowledge work - tends to be accomplished by teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to be a great teammate. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Video Games Improve Your Coding Skills?</title>
      <author>Mr. Unity Buddy</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:24:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/how-video-games-improve-your-coding-skills-2j90</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/how-video-games-improve-your-coding-skills-2j90</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, buddies! Playing video games is a great way to unwind after a hard day at work. More so, many software developers name playing video games among their hobbies. Even Zuckerberg claimed that he had started to learn programming because he was interested in the inner workings of his favorite games. So today we're going to see How Video Games Can Improve Our Coding Skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boost-learning-and-memory"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Boost Learning and Memory
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kMYRxnB8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620737061760/_s6HRr01E.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kMYRxnB8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620737061760/_s6HRr01E.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A lot of video games like Among Us require players to learn, memorize, and apply various tricks. Players also need to remember all the instructions given at the start of the game. These tricks are of great importance when it comes to programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers must be able to remember the syntax and related symbols of the coding language. Memorizing these tricks will be able to save you the time and hassle of having to refer to external links over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cognitive-strength"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cognitive strength
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the effects of video games is strengthening your attention. Selective attention defines your ability to focus on what‚Äôs relevant and filter out irrelevant information. When reviewing lines of code in an attempt to spot the errors, this kind of attention helps you to be more observant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, our productivity depends on the effective use of brain power. In video games, especially action-packed ones like Overwatch or Counter Strike, you learn how to scan efficiently for a target, snap attention back after finding it, and focusing on several targets at the same time. This may be the reason for @&lt;a href="https://dev.to@victoria"&gt;Victoria Lo&lt;/a&gt; to play Overwatch for a long time!üòÇüòÇ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problem-solving"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problem solving
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making critical decisions fast is what defines a problem solver with great programming skills. In games where decision making is often reduced to seconds, a player needs to use their brain power to the fullest before making the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do video games improve problem solving skills? Some of them might. Games like Heroes of Might and Magic which involve problem solving train your cognitive flexibility because they offer to solve fictitious problems you are not likely to face in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In programming, where you often need to approach a real-life problem with a software solution and to look at it from different angles, such flexibility and creativity will sure come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#teamwork"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Teamwork
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--92Zq8TDs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736930486/mFSE1e6ml.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--92Zq8TDs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736930486/mFSE1e6ml.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In team games like Dota2 and World of Warcraft, team effort is a necessary condition to win a game. Studies found that online team games like these help their aficionados become more valuable team players at work. However, the degree at which the virtual teamwork is translated to real life is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improve-multitasking-skills"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improve Multitasking Skills
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fpxpgaNH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736711241/CEjveaxKt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fpxpgaNH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736711241/CEjveaxKt.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There exist some video games(specially action games) that force you to multitask. These are games that oblige you to focus your attention on many different tasks at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if the game involves fighting, a player will have to keep monitoring the energy levels of fighters while simultaneously attacking enemies. Without excellent multitasking skills, one is highly likely to fall on the losing end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming will also call for excellent multitasking skills to create solutions to real-world problems. Programmers must be keen and observant to whatever is taking place on their screen and must be able to write code while simultaneously checking for errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improve-concentration-and-attentiveness"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improve Concentration and Attentiveness
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dm1WPmNI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736826108/9cT6Z-frq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dm1WPmNI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736826108/9cT6Z-frq.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A lot of action-packed video games need the highest levels of concentration and attention. The effects of losing concentration even for one second can be costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players who remain attentive throughout the gaming session have higher chances of winning. The same case applies to coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding will require you to concentrate on writing code and pinpointing coding errors to come up with tangible software. Gaming enhances your attentiveness so that you can transfer the same level of concentration to programming and improve your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nurture-and-mold-social-skills"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nurture and Mold Social Skills
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5oOpECvl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736994556/qoZAPbT7d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5oOpECvl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620736994556/qoZAPbT7d.png" alt="image.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are certain video games whose multiplayer feature calls for a team effort to win the game. Team games like World of Warcraft, Among Us and Dota2 enable players to interact with each other in a virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending several hours in front of your gaming PC, you will have improved your social skills because of their interactive nature. You will also be able to create a new social group of tech-savvy people whom you can ask about some coding language syntax whenever you need help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laravel is known the most popular open-source framework in the market, which means, the &lt;a href="https://www.itpathsolutions.com/hire-dedicated-developers/"&gt;laravel developer&lt;/a&gt; community is enormous and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt fear, the developer should more focus on building web applications and less time waste in choosing frameworks, tools, and libraries. Laravel provides more efficient components, tools, and libraries for developers. So developers have become more productive. Today Most Popular brands developed their web portals using the laravel framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction of Codeigniter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeIgniter is an extremely simple lightweight PHP framework. It provides a simple rich toolkit that helps to create full-fledged and dynamic web applications. It supports MVC architecture to hold the PHP, app design, and run database code parallelly. CodeIgnitor provides a bunch of libraries for performing various operations such as sending emails, uploading files, managing sessions, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today, these frameworks keep 0.21% of the market share. And around 50,000 websites build worldwide by CodeIgniter frameworks. It has superior data security procedures and so it is often considered the top framework in the market for creating a dynamic website utilizing PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why use CodeIgniter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It use with easily configuration and procedure for downloading, quickly setting up, and coding apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports a pre-configured class for sending the bulk of email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It holds information on web app data and visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides high-end security for unauthorized users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers can easily use various functions such as testing class, calendar class, and template engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assists to create solid and reusable components that help to make the entire web development process fast and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Popular Brand Using CodeIgniter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeIgniter provides well-structured documentation frameworks and business migrate data easily form one server to another so that this framework is much more popular in vertical business industries. Today Most Popular brands developed their web portals using the CodeIgniter framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name of the popular brand build by CodeIgniter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstcry.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Textify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casino America Inc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philippine Airlines Inc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guide Comparative Analysis of Laravel and CodeIgniter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authentication:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these laravel parameters, developers can easily implement authentication and authorized rules. In CodeIgniter developers require to write a custom extension for the authentication process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HTTP Support:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laravel provides the facilitate to build custom HTTP routes and form a precise URL for every route. CodeIgniter doesn‚Äôt give facilitate HTTP, but it also possible to URL with data transmitting method between two paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Architecture:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it offers highly a robust command-line interface and follows the MVC architecture pattern. CodeIgniter support structure-based MVC architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UNIT Testing:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laravel has an in-built unit testing tool, so developers can test app code through unit testing. While CodeIgniter it doesn‚Äôt provide inbuilt testing tool, so developers can take assist external plugin for testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESTful API:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;developers can faster build a collection of REST API through laravel frameworks. While CodeIgniter frameworks don‚Äôt easily streamline the development of restful API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reason for Popularity:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laravel framework follows the MVC Architecture pattern and makes an object-oriented approach, it is most suitable for all kinds of web applications development. While the CodeIgniter framework is so popular, it comes with easy-to-learn and offers an excellent well-structured documentation framework for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Database:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laravel is an extremely supported relational object-oriented system. While CodeIgniter follows an object-oriented programming language database model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the above, PHP Web frameworks are used very large-scale by developers for creating websites and web apps. There is no any doubt, that Laravel has provided many functionalities, great tools &amp;amp; libraries, robust database support, and inbuilt unite testing. And also CodeIgniter is not far behind. Both frameworks allow superior testing methods and better scalable options for web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore it concluded that choosing either Laravel and CodeIgniter finally depends on the type of website platform a business wants to build and maintain. In this way If you are more confused about which one is suitable for &lt;a href="https://www.itpathsolutions.com/services/web-app-development/"&gt;web development&lt;/a&gt; projects, don‚Äôt delay, do let us know by dropping a line below, we can help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Layered Navigation Could Be A Game Changer Addon?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/puneetverma321/how-layered-navigation-could-be-a-game-changer-addon-4cbn</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Layered Navigation

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of layered navigation to organise e-commerce websites has grown increasingly popular. Rather than having to browse through multiple subcategories, it allows the user to focus on specific product qualities from a top-level category page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without effective onsite navigation, it's difficult to conceive a successful eCommerce company nowadays. All of this contributes to a better customer shopping experience and, as a result, a higher conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most crucial aspects of site navigation is layered navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Layered Navigation?

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a large number of comparable products that differ only in minor features. Manually scrolling through store categories would take far too long and be extremely inconvenient, and would be unlikely to result in a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers require a tool that only surfaces the required item to alleviate the pain of such a search. &lt;a href="https://store.webkul.com/magento2-layered-navigation.html"&gt;Layered navigation&lt;/a&gt; is one such tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layered or filtered navigation is typically found adjacent to the main content block and is comprised of many adjustable filters. Customers can considerably reduce the time it takes to search for a specific product by defining their values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layered/ filtered navigation, like any other component of your store navigation, can be adjusted to meet your eCommerce strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why should use Layered Navigation?

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they don't find what they're looking for in an online store, 73% of internet users depart within two minutes (Marketing Sherpa)
96 per cent think the search feature is crucial to their purchasing decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors who utilise site search convert 5-6 times more than visitors who do not use site search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can't sell something that customers can't find. The search process is an important part of the customer purchasing decision and is a key component of practically any eCommerce site, especially when there are a lot of items with different pricing, features, or brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layered Navigation is an excellent option for improving your eCommerce store's search and filtering processes. It provides a list of filters on the left side of the categories page, so shoppers don't have to waste time looking for what they want. It is impossible to dispute that the conversion rate will increase dramatically once the search process is simplified and professionalised. The fewer time shoppers waste browsing, the lower the cart abandonment rate and the more money you may make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Key features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ajax loading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of reloading the entire page, the matching items will be displayed instantly after applying the filters. This feature will drastically improve the operation of your store and increase customer happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Multi-filters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every buyer has multiple things they want on their purchases. As a result, Multi Filters is an essential and beneficial tool. Shoppers can quickly find the perfect item by using a variety of filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;SEO friendly URL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your site will be easy to remember and access thanks to the short and straightforward filter URL produced by this function. Importantly, an SEO-friendly URL will improve your search engine ranking and greatly improve SEO performance of &lt;a href="https://store.webkul.com/Magento-2.html"&gt;Magento 2 store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quick lookup option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest option for a store with a large number of items and a variety of filters such as sizes, brands, and materials. Shoppers are no longer required to scroll endlessly or become perplexed in their search for the desired filter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>9 Ways to Win a Hackathon... Without Coming in First Place</title>
      <author>Drago»ô StrƒÉinu</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/strdr4605/9-ways-to-win-a-hackathon-without-coming-in-first-place-48ec</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/strdr4605/9-ways-to-win-a-hackathon-without-coming-in-first-place-48ec</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From my experience at hackathons, I understand that it‚Äôs not just about winning first place. You participate to learn something new, make connections and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my first hackathons, I was really focused on winning and didn‚Äôt see all the other benefits of going to a hackathon. When I didn‚Äôt win, I was so upset that I almost wanted to forget about the whole event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time I noticed that hackathons always attract multiple types of people, with different skill sets. Many of them are participating to learn something new or to train specific skills, like programming, pitching, design or business skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To actually win first place at a hackathon, you need to combine multiple components. You should have a good team of people with different skill sets. You need a good idea and even better execution. You need programmers, designers, speakers, researchers and people with good communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you don‚Äôt always (or usually) have all those things. Maybe your team isn't perfect or the hackathon topic is particularly complex, making it hard to come up with a good concept. After attending over 30 hackathons, I‚Äôve started to understand that, instead of focusing on winning first place, I can achieve a lot more by focussing on winning new skills and helping others. Treat winning first place as a bonus--the cherry on top of all the new things that you already learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let‚Äôs see what you should do to acquire skills for your needs and how to win without coming in first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-win-as-a-firsttime-newbie"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Win as a first-time newbie
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it‚Äôs your first or second hackathon and you don‚Äôt know what you should do or how your skills may help the team. Don‚Äôt worry. Take your time to learn how hackathons work, its key components and what skills are required from the participants. Don‚Äôt wait for someone to give you tasks. Ask for them, propose ideas, brainstorm with your team members. Help teammates on their tasks, practice pair programming or review the design and suggest ideas. Discuss with mentors and ask for advice not only about the hackathon but also personal/professional topics. See what tools other participants use, like programming languages, code editors, design apps, planning and collaborative tools. Ask why they prefer these tools over others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help your teammates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak with mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn new tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-win-as-a-programmer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Win as a programmer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently you‚Äôre already familiar with some programming languages, tools and frameworks to build web/mobile apps. You can use the hackathon to showcase your coding skills and learn new languages and frameworks. If you already know the backend, try doing the prototype in another language or framework. Or for this hackathon, try switching to frontend. Focus on learning specific libraries. Watch tutorials, read articles on best practice. Use as many features as possible from the library to understand pros and cons of using it, see use cases and alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a new language/framework/library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try a different programming domain (gaming/backend/frontend/machine learning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss best practice with other programmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach newbie programmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-win-as-a-designer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Win as a designer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At most hackathons, there isn‚Äôt time for complex coding solutions. In fact, sometimes the most impressive designs win without any backend implementation. As a designer, you should understand that you‚Äôre able to save your team with an amazing UI and UX. Moreover, don‚Äôt forget to focus on learning new things. Try doing a mobile/desktop/10-foot design for your app. You may also try different tools or design systems. Use a prototyping tool that will simulate the behavior of a real app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make several sketches for your application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try using tools other than those used before &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consult with your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-win-as-a-speaker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Win as a speaker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team has to delegate a person who will introduce their final product to the public. Usually, the speaker has to start preparing the presentation from the beginning of the hackathon, because judges will only see what the speaker presents. So, you have to convince them all that your solution is the best. Remember that a simple and clear demonstration is the key!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the maximum benefits of a hackathon as a speaker, you can exercise expressing your ideas in front of your teammates, where you can pay attention to your posture, gestures, and how you deliver your speech. Going through these steps, you will become more confident and convincing, qualities which are crucial for a great speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan your presentation flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try expressing your solution clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rehearse in front of your teammates &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-win-as-a-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Win as a manager
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a manager at a hackathon, you have to adapt to short term projects.There are several things you can do to deliver an MVP on time. You can distribute the tasks to your team members depending on their capacities, so make sure everyone is involved and does their best to achieve the common goal. Try setting up meetings every 5-6 hours to discuss with your team about updates and next steps. Also, a good practice is to divide tasks into subtasks to be able to monitor the process of implementation. Ensure that everyone understands their duties and performs well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup regular meetings with your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practise time management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try dividing the responsibilities into subtasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-win-as-a-mentor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Win as a mentor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hackathon mentor is like the professor for all participants. Your role as a mentor is to arouse enthusiasm and demonstrate your willingness to help. Additionally, you can strengthen your knowledge by teaching others things you‚Äôre good at. Also, you could recommend the newest tools and frameworks you have already worked with. Furthermore, you can share particular situations you‚Äôve faced and how you managed to solve them. Try explaining using straightforward methods and make sure everyone understands what you want to say. You can even prepare a presentation to cover the main topics of the hackathon, including some hacks and tricks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare a presentation covering hackathon topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approach each team to see everybody‚Äôs progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Propose your help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your experience &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-win-as-a-host"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Win as a host
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host has the most significant duties and responsibilities during a hackathon. As organizers, you can make this event go well for people to remain with positive emotions. You could organize some extra activities for fun, for instance, interactive or board games, maybe quizzes or challenges. Also, try informing everyone about each phase of the hackathon so everybody could manage their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare a plan to arrange each phase of the event on time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure everyone is aware of hackathon‚Äôs schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announce when the meals are ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try making photos/videos to capture the most colourful moments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-win-as-a-volunteer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Win as a volunteer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a volunteer, you get to see the inside process of how a hackathon is organized. You may get involved in searching for partners and funds, mentors and speakers. As a suggestion, try engaging yourself in as many activities as possible to find out what you like to do the most. You may try your management skills to properly estimate the resources, or you can demonstrate your great communication skills when speaking with sponsors and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try several roles and activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make connections among participants and organisers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widen your circle of friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-win-as-a-sponsoring-company"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Win as a sponsoring company
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT Companies are very supportive when it comes about sponsoring hackathons. This is a win-win collaboration for both companies and participants. Individuals familiarize themselves with the culture of these companies and may apply for their jobs and internships. Companies, on the other hand, may propose several job offers to some talented and diligent candidates. Also, companies may offer symbolic prizes to all participants to make everyone feel rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give attention to every team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite participants to interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote your company‚Äôs values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organise workshops regarding hackathon topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
