&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you manage your project workflows?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective project management is crucial to the success of every startup. With limited resources, it’s much cheaper to invest in great tools than more bodies. Because of this, founders and employees will &lt;a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/working-at-startup"&gt;have to wear many hats&lt;/a&gt; and have to juggle a lot of competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always relied heavily on great project management tools like the ones in this guide. We relied on them &lt;a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/product-management-process"&gt;for my previous startup’s product management process&lt;/a&gt;, and having great tools is part of the reason I’ve been able &lt;a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/scaling-services"&gt;to grow my service business to 50 team members in just 7 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Choose a Startup Project Management Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there’s a huge array of project management tools on the market, and they vary greatly in terms of price and capabilities. Since every organization is unique, there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to project management tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure you get the most effective tool for your team, you need to start with an honest assessment of your team’s capabilities and needs. If you’re already using a project management tool, ask yourself: &lt;strong&gt;what does it lack? How does it complicate your workflow? What do you need in a new solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps to take a step back and think about the organization’s pain points. &lt;strong&gt;Are you struggling to communicate with other teams? Is the workload between team members spread unevenly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List all of the pain points of your organization, then mark each one with a priority level—high, medium, or low. Once you’ve made an outline, begin your search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using your outline as a guide, make a list of the tools that fit your needs. Depending on the size of your business, you might be able to use the tools for free. If a trial isn’t offered upfront, you can ask the vendors for a free demo for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important part of this process is the trial. You need to test the features and capabilities to determine if it can fully meet your needs. These trials need to be quick because you can’t spend years looking for the perfect tool, but they should help you decide if the tool is good enough for your use case or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  12 Best Startup Project Management Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I’ll walk you through the best &lt;strong&gt;startup project management tools&lt;/strong&gt; on the market in 2021. You’ll see some of the major advantages and use cases for each as well as get insight into their pricing models. I’m sure this list will need to change over time, so be sure to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes"&gt;ping me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you know of another tool I should add to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#teamwave"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1530551&amp;amp;u=1653894&amp;amp;m=96830"&gt;TeamWave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1530551&amp;amp;u=1653894&amp;amp;m=96830"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---8-qq5VM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/kJoMrK5.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TeamWave is a project management, HR management, and customer relationship management tool rolled into one. You can plan and manage meetings, tasks, and events for the entire team. You can also streamline your communication and collaboration with team members, clients, and partners. If you have sensitive information that you only want to share with select people, you can also do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It integrates with a wide array of tools, including Slack, QuickBooks, Dropbox, and G Suite. Instead of using multiple apps to get things done, you can use TeamWave to keep everything centralized. Whether on desktop or mobile, you’ll be able to manage your business from anywhere and at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their base plan, which comes with &lt;a href="https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1530551&amp;amp;u=1653894&amp;amp;m=96830"&gt;all of TeamWave’s features&lt;/a&gt;, starts at $39 per month. It is suitable for growing teams because it supports an unlimited number of users. More importantly, TeamWave has a free 14-day trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mondaycom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mondaycom.grsm.io/karlhughes7109"&gt;Monday.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mondaycom.grsm.io/karlhughes7109"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H2RuP6zy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/cqwX9WV.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday can help your business move forward by bringing your team and work together on one platform. It is easy to set up and customize. You can choose from hundreds of creative templates or design your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has intuitive dashboards that let you visualize your tasks and progress. It makes it easier for you to monitor and manage all of your resources. Plus, it integrates with all of your tools, including Slack, Excel, and Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basic plan, which is ideal for startups, costs $8 per user per month. It doesn’t have a free version, but it offers a free trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#airtable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr"&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NRvPNTlF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/iuElXQG.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airtable can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. It uses a spreadsheet-like interface with rows and columns, which you can use to add text, photos, notes, and other types of media. It has a selection of Airtable Views, such as Grid View and Calendar View, with powerful sorting and filtering features that enable you to personalize and monitor your progress in your preferred way. You can even use it &lt;a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/using-airtable-as-an-api"&gt;as a backend or CMS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from project management, it is great for managing your social media content. You can use it to plan and organize your monthly social calendars. On top of all that, you can choose from 50+ pre-built apps to extend the functionality of Airtable and tons of &lt;a href="https://airtable.com/templates"&gt;free templates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Airtable, you can get started for free no matter the size of your team. It has paid plans to accommodate the growing needs of your organization, starting at $10 per month per user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a heavy Airtable user for years and talked about it on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaDp6yC1fb4"&gt;Built on Air Podcast&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#trello"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZzyZxMvu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/LSlkiOL.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZzyZxMvu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/LSlkiOL.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello is &lt;a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/trello-as-a-reading-list"&gt;another one of my long-time favorite tools&lt;/a&gt;. Trello can transform your organization into a productivity powerhouse once you learn how to use it effectively. Its intuitive features enable you to customize your workflows. Using Trello cards, you can manage, track, and share all of your tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello harnesses the power of automation to minimize tedious tasks and processes. You can, for instance, make custom buttons to carry out specific processes quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get Trello for free. As your organization scales, you can get the paid plans, which come with unlimited boards, advanced checklists, and priority support among other things. The paid plans start at $10 per user per month and are worth every cent in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basecamp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basecamp
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sYQIfGlq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/YkxXsJ3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sYQIfGlq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/YkxXsJ3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer recommend Basecamp due to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"&gt;new policies banning political discussions&lt;/a&gt;, but I did write a new list of companies with better track records on diversity and inclusion that you can &lt;a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/basecamp-alternatives"&gt;use as an alternative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clubhouse"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://clubhouse.io/"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WVbkyRXw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/gFXeZuu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WVbkyRXw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/gFXeZuu.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clubhouse is designed to help you plan, build, and measure your projects. You can make a Story for your tasks using pre-made templates to help you save time. In each story, you can attach the tasks and documents needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Epics and Milestones, you can monitor the progress of your entire organization. That means you can keep track of the small everyday tasks. More importantly, you can see how closer you are to achieving a larger goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a small team consisting of 1 to 10 members, you can use Clubhouse for free. You can get the paid plans starting at $8.50 per user per month, which supports an unlimited number of users and advanced reporting among other things. You can try the Standard plan for free for 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#clickup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://clickup.com/"&gt;ClickUp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NviZRSER--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/uKpYGpn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NviZRSER--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/uKpYGpn.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ClickUp has comprehensive features and functionalities that make your job a breeze. You can get work done in no time using slash commands. Using a menu of shortcuts, you can access task details, formatting options, and more with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ClickUp, you can organize your tasks from simple to complex. You can communicate with your team members on the platform itself in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what device you use, ClickUp lets you leverage time tracking insights. For every project, you can set clear expectations, along with time estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ClickUp has a free version, which can support unlimited members and unlimited tasks. It also has 100 MB of storage. It only has a single paid plan, which costs $5 per user per month. It has more comprehensive features, such as guests, permissions, custom fields, and portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x6_3B44S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/mRdej2F.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x6_3B44S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/mRdej2F.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notion is a user-friendly, clutter-free workspace, which comes with customization options that let you organize your tasks in the way you like. You can customize the database properties to create your ideal workflow. It also gives you enough flexibility to create content from notes to full documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For individual use, you can get Notion for free. You can share it with up to five guests and sync it across multiple devices. For unlimited guests and file uploads, you can pay $4 per month for the Personal Pro plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to bring Notion into your small team, you can get it for $8 per user per month. It boasts unlimited members, advanced permissions, admin tools, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the paid plans have free trial versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asana"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://asana.com/"&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mnSzxes_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/1UQ6cT8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mnSzxes_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/1UQ6cT8.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#jira"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/"&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--36etMeJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/Hgq6J1T.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--36etMeJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/Hgq6J1T.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed for software teams, Jira is the project management tool that can help you plan and release excellent software on schedule. It lets you distribute and track tasks across your team. By keeping everyone connected on a single platform, you can create smarter plans that can help you get work done faster and more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jira understands that every team has its unique process. On the platform, you can make your own workflow. You can also choose one that matches your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small team of 10 can use Jira for free. It has agile reporting, customizable workflows, and basic roadmaps. If you want advanced capabilities, it has paid plans, starting at $7 per user per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrike"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://try.wrike.com/"&gt;Wrike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1jCzi4j3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0wdEkLK.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1jCzi4j3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/0wdEkLK.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrike uses interactive Gantt charts to help you schedule tasks. With a drag-and-drop interface, you can easily make adjustments to your charts and keep everyone up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-hosting software &amp; why it may be worth considering again now</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/signoz/self-hosting-software-why-it-may-be-worth-considering-again-now-454l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can hear your mind wheels spinning -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s this blasphemy? Isn’t SaaS the end of all evils - why are you asking me to think about keeping data in your infrastructure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, well - allow me to explain. SaaS is the greatest thing after sliced bread, if you are a small startup. You don’t care about where your data is, privacy and security is not something which you are concerned about right now. You just want to move fast and break things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all companies are born equal, and not all industries are the same in terms of the sensitivity of data they handle. And as you mature as a company, you need to be more careful of how you handle your critical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are a fast growing fin-tech company working with a number of banking APIs and enabling hundreds of financial transactions daily, you better keep your data within your infra or at least within the same cloud where the rest of your data is. You can’t use a SaaS service which has its servers in the USA while you are in India, otherwise your auditors will come after you. Especially if it contains data which can potentially have customer information like traces or logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the observability domain, traces and logs are something which you don’t want to send outside. Unless you have great PII scrapers running before sending data outside, and well we all know it is not easy to create PII scrapers which work with 100% accuracy. So even if you have PII scrapers, why do you want to take the risk of some tiny bit of customer data leaking - and you inviting the fury of your legal and audit teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are few other reasons also which should at the very least encourage you to think about this option&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase in privacy laws like GDPR/CPRA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility of configuration as you are not crossing the Internet boundary every time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data egress cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data breaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control - Some teams just like more control of the software running, not depend upon scheduled maintenance &amp;amp; downtimes of SaaS products. What if you have a critical release coming up, and there is a downtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us examine few of these in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#privacy-laws"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Privacy Laws
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018 and has been an essential step in strengthening citizens’ fundamental rights in the current Digital Revolution, and monitoring businesses, and preventing these companies from misusing data for their capital gains which puts the user at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;California Privacy Regulation Act (CPRA)&lt;/em&gt; is another privacy law which will impose more privacy requirements around sharing user data with 3rd party vendors. From 2023, users can opt-out of their data being shared to 3rd party vendors ( including vendors like DataDog, Google Analytics, etc.). If you are using a 3rd party monitoring tool, you have to scrub your observability data before sending it to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, you won't have complete visibility into what is happening in your software infra now, how will you debug it when a critical issue comes &amp;amp; management is breathing down your neck to fix it - like yesterday?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-breaches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data breaches
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud vendors are a honeypot for security breaches, as hacking a single SaaS vendor will give hackers access to critical data of many companies. You don’t know if your data also gets breached because hackers hacked a SaaS provider for accessing another of their customers. Many times there’s no clear isolation between data of different companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using 100 SaaS vendors, and each has only 0.5% chance of having a security breach, then you have 1 - (0.995)^100 = ~40% chance of having a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all your SaaS vendors equally well secure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-egress-cost"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data egress cost
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something which many engineering teams are not aware about, as this is just a line item in your AWS/GCP bill which few people give attention to. But if you are sending huge amount of monitoring/logging data to a SaaS vendor, this line item will soon start rearing its head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS charges for transfer that send data out over the internet are billed at   region-specific and tiered data transfer rates. If you are sending 10 TB in a month to Internet, just this would add 900 USD to your monthly bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V2BTzdcw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ot5ljsdszgkqnb2cufku.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V2BTzdcw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ot5ljsdszgkqnb2cufku.jpg" alt="Data transfer pricing of AWS"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AWS data transfer pricing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant Miller, CEO of Replicated recently wrote an interesting blog on why modern on-prem delivery model is a much better software delivery model than SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, SaaS was a welcome change from the world of legacy on-prem software deployment in early 2000s. You would need to buy costly hardware, the annual licenses to start running with your software and then employ consultants to actually get the software up and running. The whole process would easily take 3-6 months - and this is when everything  runs on time. Then there would be annual ritual of upgrading the software which would be another pain in the a***.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandably, SaaS was a welcome change in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the coming of new cloud native technologies and Kubernetes, this process has become much more simpler. You can install a software today by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;kubectl deploy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and to upgrade the software you just need to update the Helm charts and deploy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when this gives you advantages of privacy, security and more control as discussed about, why not at least give some serious thought to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If you need more social proof to give more thought into this, here's  Elon Musk tweeting about how Tesla ONLY uses "internal &amp;amp; open source software"

&lt;p&gt;SigNoz helps developer monitor applications and troubleshoot problems in their deployed applications. SigNoz uses distributed tracing to gain visibility into your software stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 You can see metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls and individual end points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 You can find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed flamegraphs of individual request traces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
👇 Features:&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application overview metrics like RPS, 50th/90th/99th Percentile latencies, and Error Rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowest endpoints in your application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See exact request trace to figure out issues in downstream services, slow DB queries, call to 3rd party services like payment gateways, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter traces by service name, operation, latency, error, tags/annotations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregate metrics on filtered traces. Eg, you can get error…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another portion of cloud technology news is at your doorstep! This series brings you up to speed with the latest releases, acquisitions, research, and hidden gems in the world of cloud computing – the stuff actually worth reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the cloud world has been up to this May.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#story-of-the-month-youre-crazy-if-you-dont-start-in-the-cloud-youre-crazy-if-you-stay-on-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Story of the month: “You’re crazy if you don’t start in the cloud; you’re crazy if you stay on it.”
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this isn’t exactly news. But the analysis from a16z deserves your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the gist of the piece:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cloud delivers on its promise early on, once your company scales and its growth slows down, &lt;strong&gt;cloud costs start putting pressure on margins&lt;/strong&gt; and contribute &lt;strong&gt;A LOT&lt;/strong&gt; to COR or COGS.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I1cMN1a3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/334euef7kpd0rmty8jg0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--I1cMN1a3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/334euef7kpd0rmty8jg0.png" alt="Source: a16z"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repatriating (going on-prem) is one solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Dropbox achieved a smashing $75 million in cost savings by doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 top public software companies using the cloud are &lt;strong&gt;losing c. $100 billion of market value&lt;/strong&gt; due to cloud impact on margins (relative to running the infra on their own).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total impact is potentially &lt;strong&gt;more than $500 billion&lt;/strong&gt; in cost savings.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets really interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committed cloud spend is typically ~20% lower than actual spend and some companies a16z spoke with reported exceeding their estimations by at least 2x!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that &lt;strong&gt;mature companies should move to on-prem?&lt;/strong&gt; Not necessarily. After all, building your own data center involves a massive effort. And the cloud still offers perks like on-demand capacity and plenty of existing services that can instantly support new projects and locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to deal with the long-term cost implications of the cloud?&lt;/strong&gt; a16z argues that infrastructure spending should become a first-class metric – and we totally agree with that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they failed to mention one good solution enough: the fact that infra costs depend on a team’s ability to provision “just what you need.” Cloud cost optimization is the low-hanging fruit here. It lets you stay where you are, but for half of the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  The Business of Cloud
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vodafone&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/strong&gt; are teaming up to jointly develop data services. 1k employees will be working on &lt;strong&gt;Nucleus, a new cloud-based storage and analytics portal&lt;/strong&gt; capable of processing ~50 terabytes of data per day in the cloud. So, Vodafone data will end up on Google Cloud servers (and probably stay there for the entire six-year agreement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, &lt;strong&gt;SAP is loosening its relationship with Microsoft Azure&lt;/strong&gt; as a preferred vendor for hosting S/4HANA. Now SAP will encourage customers to host the solution wherever they want thanks to expanded support for the other providers (AWS, Google, and Alicloud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge computing is here,&lt;/strong&gt; with a projected spend of &lt;strong&gt;$240.6 billion through 2024!&lt;/strong&gt; Take Red Hat as an example – it recently launched an edge-computing platform that operates across multiple cloud services. Most companies turn to edge computing when transferring data back and forth becomes too expensive, for real-time responses, and semi-automated functions. We’re curious to see how this aspect of cloud computing develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;strong&gt;AI &amp;amp; cloud computing &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/blog/cloud-technology-news-of-the-month-april-2021/"&gt;shopping spree of IBM&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, here’s something new. IBM is pivoting towards cloud services + AI with Watson Orchestrate. “In the same way that we electrified factories and machines in the past century, we will &lt;strong&gt;use hybrid cloud to infuse AI&lt;/strong&gt; into software and systems in the 21st century,” said IBM’s CEO Arvind Krishna. How are companies going to use the new Watson? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-in-cast-ai"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  New in CAST AI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pp9_FsTl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/moxhd0y2m05ho7zw0t3o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pp9_FsTl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/moxhd0y2m05ho7zw0t3o.png" alt="CAST AI EKS optimizer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Last month, we shared the brand-new &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/eks-optimizer/"&gt;EKS Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; with you. Your feedback inspired us to fast-track the development of something similar – only this time, to help those who use Google and the GKE platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introducing-gke-analyzer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introducing: GKE Analyzer
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GKE Analyzer&lt;/strong&gt; goes through your cluster costs, pinpoints any potential savings you could achieve, and then tells you how to get there. &lt;strong&gt;GKE isn’t available publicly yet – to get access, book a demo with our experts &lt;a href="https://calendly.com/matas-c"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some new product features hot off the press:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made cost optimization policies available to EKS clusters created outside of CAST AI! You can now onboard your &lt;a href="https://docs.cast.ai/getting-started/external-cluster/eks/eks/"&gt;EKS credentials and start using CAST AI policies&lt;/a&gt; to reduce your cloud bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our team also created a &lt;a href="https://docs.cast.ai/guides/start-saving-quickly/"&gt;guide on how to migrate out of EKS nodes into CAST AI selected nodes&lt;/a&gt; in AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also uplifted the design of the Available Savings report to help you understand our recommendations better and take the next steps towards an optimal cluster configuration easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our team prepared a &lt;a href="https://docs.cast.ai/guides/vpa/"&gt;guide for the installation and configuration of VPA&lt;/a&gt; for pod rightsizing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Are you running Kubernetes on EKS?&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t forget to test the &lt;a href="https://cast.ai/eks-optimizer/"&gt;EKS Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; and get a handful of savings suggestions.
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Use a Neural Network without its library
</title>
      <author>Matias Vazquez-Levi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:59:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/matiasvlevi/use-a-neural-network-without-it-s-library-3383</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/matiasvlevi/use-a-neural-network-without-it-s-library-3383</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Various web applications use Neural Networks. The only downside is that you need to import an entire library to run these types of algorithms, which might be inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the Dannjs library has a way of saving a Neural Network as a standalone JS function, which allows you to get the predictions without including the whole library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short tutorial, we're going to train an XOR neural network in the new Online editor, and then use it in another browser without importing the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the requirements for this tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dannjs.org/sandbox"&gt;Dannjs Online Editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any web browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by creating the Neural Network.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Dann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addHiddenLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;leakyReLU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;makeWeights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;lr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#training"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Training
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can train the neural network with the XOR logic, 1000 epochs should do the trick.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;epochs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;epochs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backpropagate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backpropagate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backpropagate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;backpropagate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once trained, we can test the output&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;feedForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;feedForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;feedForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;feedForward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This should result in accurate predictions&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Prediction:
[0.9955815601552473]

Prediction:
[0.9954508755506862]

Prediction:
[0.04536960523468736]

Prediction:
[0.003240998243744729]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#save"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Save
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can finally save the Neural Network as a minified function as a string that we can copy &amp;amp; use anywhere else.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is how you would use the function in another JS environment such as the chrome console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BH29n6EM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.ibb.co/mvwLygc/outputonly.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BH29n6EM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.ibb.co/mvwLygc/outputonly.png" alt="XOR minified"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that we get the same predictions because every single parameter has been saved into the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature allows us to use any neural network outside of the library, making the usage of these algorithms in web applications simple &amp;amp; lightweight. Loading times on web pages is always a good thing to look out for, making this a neat trick to know about!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>✨ I'm getting PUBLISHED ✨</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/alejandra_quetzalli/i-m-getting-published-428k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;✨ I'm getting PUBLISHED ✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent book proposal was accepted by not 1, but 2 publishers! I'm humbled to have been given the opportunity to select to work with Apress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📚 Designing Developer Documentation as a Product&lt;br&gt;
🗓 Early 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't feel real quite yet, but looking at the official Apress contract sure helps make it real! Eeek!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AoKDNlVe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/plz2ninidctub5vqht1q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AoKDNlVe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/plz2ninidctub5vqht1q.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/dabit3"&gt;@dabit3&lt;/a&gt;
 who first introduced me to contacts in acquisitions at both Manning and O'Reilly. Next thank you goes to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig"&gt;Corey Quinn&lt;/a&gt; for pushing me to not go with the first publishing house that accepts me. He also introduced me to Apress folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've dreamed and had the goal of getting published since I was 8 years old. It still feels unreal to me! I am so excited for the dream to come true! This vid is a little longer than 5mins, but I wanted to tell my story, so worth it.😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYRa-yfy7S0"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, thank you all who are responding with such enthusiasm already to my book! 📚🤗&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a remix using Tone.js</title>
      <author>Ash Freels</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:52:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ashfreels/creating-a-remix-using-tone-js-1kdg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ashfreels/creating-a-remix-using-tone-js-1kdg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a break from making music for a few years and wanted to return to composing music. This is a great time to return to my passion after a long hiatus. In the first step of creating music with code. I have decided to jump in and learn Tone.js. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-tonejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Tone.js
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tone.js is a web audio framework used to create music in a browser. It is flexible and can be used to create various music web applications. Tone.js documentation has examples, documentation and demos on their GitHub page. The &lt;a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/"&gt;Chrome Music Lab&lt;/a&gt; uses Tone.js. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-mary-had-a-little-lamb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating Mary had a little lamb
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start off we have to create a javascript file and create a synth. We have the exported Tone object and for the instrument,  MembraneSynth is used to make the sounds with.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const synth = new Tone.MembraneSynth().toMaster();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have to add the notes to Mary had a little lamb. This is done by creating an array for the notes. Use null to create a rest or a pause.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const notes = [
 "A3",
 "G2",
 "F1",
 "G2", 
 "A3",
 "A3", 
 "A3", 
 null,
 "G2",
 "G2",
 "G2",
 null,
 "A3",
 "C5",
 "C5",
 null
];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have to set the bpm. In this example I set it to 130.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tone.Transport.bpm.value = 130
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a sequence with the synth and notes. For the last part we have to setup starting the audio so it can play in the browser.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const seq = new Tone.Sequence((time, note) =&amp;gt; {
    synth.triggerAttackRelease(note, 1.0 , time);
  },
  notes,
  "4n"
);

seq.start();
Tone.Transport.start();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the browser the audio will loop a segment of Mary had a little lamb. This was my first experiment with Tone.js. The framework can be used to create more complex web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tonejs-resources-for-beginners"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tone.js resources for beginners
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tonejs.github.io/"&gt;Tone.js page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/dev-red/tutorial-lets-make-music-with-javascript-and-tone-js-f6ac39d95b8c"&gt;Tone.js tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Language learning apps for kids</title>
      <author>Alex</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:42:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/alexanderkdev/language-learning-apps-for-kids-512</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/alexanderkdev/language-learning-apps-for-kids-512</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us have always been learning foreign languages for various reasons – travel and meeting new people, career and business, self-improvement and fun, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to succeed in learning a language is to start with it as a kid. The age of 5-12 is the most productive time for everyone, as your brain absorbs any information fast and retains it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you planning to create a language learning app that kids will love? Study the main aspects of such a startup before you contact the developers and discuss further details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistically, 80% of young Europeans (aged 15-30) speak at least one foreign language. Many of them have learned it or improved their school knowledge with different kinds of apps and websites. The main benefits of E-learning are availability at any time and place, convenience, and low prices. If you create an app like that, it can bring you a steady income – for instance, the global market of digital English learning solutions is the most profitable, with revenue estimated at over $4 billion in 2018 and predicted to reach $54.9 billion by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other popular apps for children and teenagers helping them learn foreign languages. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EASY peasy – an English learning app for kids aged 5-7 and older;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindsnacks – a series of language learning apps for kids and adults; it includes popular offers like Spanish and French alongside rarer options, e.g., Japanese;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lirica – a clever app for teens aged 12-13 and older; it helps learn world languages with the lyrics of pop hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is one of the most successful language learning apps for kids and adults. It has become world-famous and earned over $100 million for six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current market, you’ll find the following types of language learning apps and websites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital courses like Duolingo, Rosetta Stone (both have versions of their products to help kids learn foreign languages), Mondly Kids or FluentU;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashcards-based and other repetition apps like Drops, Anki App, or Quizlet;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-learning games like Gus Οn Τhe Go or Endless Spanish;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language learning video-based apps like Little Pim or LingoDeer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to create a language learning app for kids, prepare for a challenging job. You’ll need a well-thought conception, experienced authors of training materials, and a team of qualified app developers. Invest in professionals’ work to get an excellent end-product for the competitive E-learning market. We hope that our suggestions are helpful for creating a kids’ language learning app. Start with deciding what kind of solution to develop and how much to budget for it. Here at Exceed Team (&lt;a href="https://exceed-team.com/contact?s=re&amp;amp;a=d"&gt;https://exceed-team.com/contact?s=re&amp;amp;a=d&lt;/a&gt;), we offer top-quality app development services for E-learning and other industries. Don’t hesitate to ask us any questions, and we’ll find the best way to carry out your idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/sbalasa/knapsack-algorithm-i0o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three types to implement a Knapsack Algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knapsack Recursive (Basic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knapsack Memoization (Cached)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knapsack TopDown (Optimized)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            knapsack(w, v, W, n-1)
        )
    else:
        return knapsack(w, v, W, n-1)

# Knapsack Problem Memoization

def knapsack_memoization(w, v, W, n):
    t = [[-1 for _ in range(W+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]  # Matrix n x W

                t[i][j] = max(v[i-1] + t[i-1][j-w[i-1]], t[i-1][j])
            else:
                t[i][j] = t[i-1][j]
    return t[n][W]

# Input
w = [2, 3, 4, 5] # Weights
v = [3, 4, 5, 6] # Values 
W = 5 # Max Knapsack Capacity

# Output
print("Knapsack Recursive -&amp;gt; ", knapsack(w, v, W, len(w)))
print("Knapsack Memoization -&amp;gt; ", knapsack_memoization(w, v, W, len(w)))
print("Knapsack TopDown -&amp;gt; ", knapsack_top_down(w, v, W, len(w)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Resiliency: 5 Tips to Learning How to Code and Surviving Tech Boot Camps</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jcsmileyjr/resiliency-5-tips-to-learning-how-to-code-and-surviving-tech-boot-camps-25h6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had the blessing to be a teacher assistant at two tech boot-camps. I would like to share my observations on what it took to survive, thrive, and grab the reward of graduating from a tech boot camp. In particular, regarding the &lt;strong&gt;resiliency&lt;/strong&gt; factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resiliency is the ability to fail over and over while never giving up. It means to continue to feed the passion and not get discouraged. Finally, it means to do it even though you're afraid or don't feel qualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#willing-to-struggle-without-quitting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Willing to Struggle without Quitting
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful boot-campers must be resilient and be willing to struggle without quitting. When talking to them, I learned how they would study at night, in the morning, on their break at work, on vacation, and anytime they were free. &lt;strong&gt;They made learning to code a Priority, not an optional task.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a TA, I encourage my students to carve out time to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you wake early before your family wakes up or code once the kids are asleep? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to create a regular dedicated uninterrupted time period to learn your craft. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I advocate that it's better to learn 1% each day then to cram learning into one weekend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beg, borrow, or steal time from other activities to stay focused on the boot-camp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wDPnNAeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/23pqxwiphz8e9ijjzhc1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wDPnNAeP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/23pqxwiphz8e9ijjzhc1.png" alt="Man reading his watch and standing next to a sand hour glass"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#endure-to-the-finish-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Endure to the Finish line
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ones who got the job during or after the boot-camp were those who strive to finish it. They did not quit. There are many concepts and skills that you don't learn the first time you experience them at the beginning of class. &lt;strong&gt;It's the repetition of coding, giving presentations, and completing projects that overtime cements the advanced skills that are needed to be a developer.&lt;/strong&gt; It's constantly being around tech culture over time that allows you to talk about tech in future interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the unfortunate experience of seeing a brilliant student, who mastered concepts at the beginning of class and was my star pupil, get bored and abandon the boot-camp. When I finally had a chance to talk to that student, I found out that what she wanted to learn was simply a few weeks further into the course. If she had stayed, built the foundational skills, and then learned the skills she craved; I have no doubt she would have been a successful developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical Tip: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Each day, plan what challenges you will overcome and what key thing you will learn. Use a calendar, bullet journaling, or a digital to-do list to help you stay focused on the now. Consider that each new skill you learn builds upon each other to build a masterpiece that is impossible to see at this moment in your career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VnP49u17--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p94r3co9meh9pvwd9t4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VnP49u17--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p94r3co9meh9pvwd9t4.png" alt="Woman running across the race's finish line"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-solutions-to-your-unique-learning-challenges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find Solutions to your Unique Learning Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best boot-campers didn't let anything hold them back. They were willing to find solutions to challenges to learning that they faced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember one student who finished all her work 6 weeks early so she could have her baby. I was amazed at the amount of work she accomplished and the focus to never miss an assignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example was when a student had a broken laptop, they used their cell phone, pair-programmed with a fellow student, and utilized a library computer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't make it to class, many students notified me early to see if it can be recorded and then sent questions later to verify their understanding of concepts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assignments were turned in early just in case something happened before the deadline. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing was going to hold them back from learning and starting a new career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fortify-your-mind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fortify your Mind
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to be willing to learn, willing to fail, and willing to stretch your brain muscles. Coding isn't about writing mindless boilerplate code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are constantly learning and testing your brain power. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are testing if you can fail repeatedly and still rise to the challenge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More importantly, you are learning about yourself, how you learn best,  and how to execute your knowledge to overcome software challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical Tip: I can't stress enough how important it is to meditate or pray daily. Coding takes your mind through mental gymnastics on a daily basics. You have to make time to clear your mind, release mental anxiety, and reset your focus. Talk to someone about your problems. There is nothing wrong with crying if it solves the problem. There is nothing wrong with saying, "I'm lost, confuse, etc." You can overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#strengthen-your-body"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Strengthen your Body
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, resiliency means to make sure you are physically capable to endure to the end of the boot-camp. In my opinion, I think medical issues was one of the leading causes of student drop off. You have to take care of yourself. You can’t forgo sleep and expect to remember what you just learned. It comes with no surprise that those who succeeded place a high value on healthy decisions to protect their body and mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UO-gQ0oR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tthmsfpdg8wcsdb9fll8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UO-gQ0oR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tthmsfpdg8wcsdb9fll8.jpg" alt="Man in super-man t-shirt lifting weights"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practices you can emulate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carve out times around work, family, friends, and all the crazy things life throws at you to LEARN. I'm not saying those things aren't important, but you have to decide if this career change is a priority or an option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter an obstacle, then plan around, over, under, and through it. But do not quit or stop learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push yourself to survive to the end. I saw them crawl, hobble, pull themselves, or was pull by others to the finish line. But they were determined to not give up. Each person must be resilient to the unique challenges they will face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be willing to learn a lot in a small time period. This means being able to learn how you learn, organize your learning, and quickly act upon that knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to end by saying it's painful as a teacher assistant to watch students fail. They fail for lots of reasons but it normally starts at the beginning of the journey. My advice to any who is aspiring to learn to code is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You sow what you reap. If you want a good harvest, put in the work from the start to the finish. Don't give up on a dream because its hard. Will it be easy. Nope. Will it be worth it. Absolutely ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>How to sell an npm package: A Guide</title>
      <author>Sebastian Hoitz</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 13:08:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sebastianhoitz/how-to-sell-an-npm-package-a-guide-2dn9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sebastianhoitz/how-to-sell-an-npm-package-a-guide-2dn9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I quit the last company I was working at to pursue my own business adventures, building and selling a starter template or software library was high on my list of things I wanted to do.&lt;br&gt;
However, when I started to think about how I could actually do this, I realized there are not a lot of tools available that do a good job at this. Gumroad is a provider used by many creators, but not well suited for code. Other services target nodejs/npm only and leave out all the rest of the programming languages. So I figured out: I need to scratch my own itch and build this service first. Similar to Gumroad, but laser-focused on developers. Talk about niching down! And just like that, the idea for basetools was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I would like to show you how quickly you can start selling your own npm packages or other code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to start selling an npm package using basetools. However, there are some prerequisites to start selling: You have to have a private Github repository inside an organization and you have to publish your package using the Github registry. But we will cover all of this within this guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-the-repository"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set up the repository
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this guide, we will create a brand new repository on Github and start from there. If you have already created a repository, you can just skip this step.&lt;br&gt;
For our example, we are creating a new private repository within our organization &lt;code&gt;basetools-io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V6AWMUab--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1y9ziby59tku3oifjw6q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V6AWMUab--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1y9ziby59tku3oifjw6q.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, our new repository is called &lt;code&gt;basetools-npm-showcase&lt;/code&gt;. So let's get started on your machine:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;basetools-npm-showcase
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"# basetools-npm-showcase"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; README.md
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'module.exports = () =&amp;gt; console.log("hello world")'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; index.js
git init
git add README.md index.js
git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"first commit"&lt;/span&gt;
git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-M&lt;/span&gt; main
git remote add origin git@github.com:basetools-io/basetools-npm-showcase.git
git push &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-u&lt;/span&gt; origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have now created a private repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-the-packagejson"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup the package.json
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to initialize the package.json, so that our repository can be treated as an npm package. We can easily do this by calling npm init. Important: Our package name has to contain our organization name. So instead of &lt;code&gt;basetools-npm-showcase&lt;/code&gt; we have to call our package &lt;code&gt;@basetools-io/basetools-npm-showcase&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure to commit the package.json to your repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#publish-the-package-to-your-github-registry"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Publish the package to your Github registry
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to always publish this package to the Github registry, you have to configure the npm registry in your package.json:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"publishConfig": {
  "registry":"https://npm.pkg.github.com"
},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You also have to log in with your Github account. To do that, first generate a personal access token here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens"&gt;https://github.com/settings/tokens&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to activate the &lt;strong&gt;write:packages&lt;/strong&gt; permission. Copy the generated token. Now, back in the terminal type in&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm login &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--registry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;https://npm.pkg.github.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If this was successful, you can finally publish your package:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm publish
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-the-product-on-basetools"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding the product on basetools
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have completed the steps above, you can create an account on basetools if you haven't done so yet. After registration click that you want to add a new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yzTzw3S7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ihzogfxbancbnfgdt656.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yzTzw3S7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ihzogfxbancbnfgdt656.png" alt="Add the npm packlage as a product to basetools"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, you can start selling! basetools automatically creates a checkout page for you. You can link to this page from your website, for example. After a successful payment, your customer will be automatically invited to your repository as a collaborator. This will grant him access to the repository and the packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GIW1giTc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lpqv4r1ffv9s1nx6f7lg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GIW1giTc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lpqv4r1ffv9s1nx6f7lg.png" alt="Confirmation of a sale of your npm package"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-install-the-package-as-your-customer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to install the package as your customer
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your customer has bought access to your repository, he also has to log in to npm with the Github account that was used when buying your product:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm login &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--registry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;https://npm.pkg.github.com &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;@OWNER
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;@OWNER&lt;/code&gt; is the name of your repositories account, in our example &lt;code&gt;@basetools-io&lt;/code&gt;. When this was successful, the package can be installed like any other npm package:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; @basetools-io/basetools-npm-showcase
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
