      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Based Cryptomining Apps like Pi Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for cloud based crypto mining apps like Pi Network so there are certain apps which looks legit and can bring some value in future if you mine now because the list of apps which I’m providing are backed by tech experts in review, they have good future plans, white paper, and their founders are well known people who are doing regular conferences and presentation so make people aware about their coins and plans. I guess there are more then 12-15 crypto mining apps, which are offering free mining for their coins, but if you will look closely, so there are only 5 to7 apps which looks legit and most of these apps are following the model of Pi Network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pi Network - referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pi Network's app is a cloud mining based crypto currency which is quite different from other crypto currencies. However, other crypto currencies have seen how easy it is for Pi to be mined and are trying to copy Pi's mode of operation. With only five seconds of your day on your smartphone and no investment, you can have a chance to receive a huge amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the soaring price of Bitcoin, we no longer have a chance to own Bitcoin, but you can mine Pi for free and that too without any investment. The Pi Network, is kind of the first digital currency that you can mine on your phone," has become a popular topic of discussion on social media and these days many apps are copying the same model and mode of operations after evaluating the feasibility of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Store: -  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-network/id1445472541"&gt;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-network/id1445472541&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockchainvault"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockchainvault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pi Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bee Network - referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bee network is genuine and a new type of cryptocurrency and there for it is not listed on cryptocurrency exchanges and their is no value for now but in future their will be value of these Bee Coins for sure, once they get listed on the exchanges. Bee network, almost similar to Pi app and in short we can say that it's almost copy of Pi apps, which means Bee's success so far is based on Pi's success. I know it should ring panic alarm because it's for a big part of a copy-paste project, but in reality this happens all the time and doesn't always mean it's a scam, like; Bitcoin BEP2, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and they all are kind of similar and successful too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Store: -  &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bee-network-phone-based-asset/id1529988919"&gt;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bee-network-phone-based-asset/id1529988919&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.bee.app"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.bee.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bee Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timestope - Witness (referral) code:crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timestope is south Korean project with some background in technology and cryptocurrencies. It seems Timestope is consist of team of a legit people in a company that's already been making apps for some time. There are chances in future their currency will have some better value as they are also running some other dApps from their own platform. It seems Timestope can't be successful as Pi Network, but eventually it will bring some value as mining is free on your phone and you don’t have to pay anything except for clicking on their app once a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis of TimeStope is to be a witness. Only those who have been invited by the witness can create the TIME through TimeStope, and 9.6τ is distributed to the invitee every day. When the mining period expires, you must witness for someone other than the invitee who invited you and the person you invited, and the attendance score will be reset. This is a way to consistently provide fair opportunities to new participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timestope"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timestope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timestope Witness (referral) code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Network - referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha Networks is a blockchain-powered entertainment platform dedicated to building the infrastructure of the next era of media. Alpha Network combines subscription VOD, targeted advertising, and pay-per-view business models on one platform for a seamless user experience. With Alpha Network you can earn cryptocurrency from your phone by pressing a button every 24 hours. There are a few ways in which you can increase the amount of Alpha coins you earn per hour. But before we go into that, have a look at their presentation video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems Alpha coin is very reliable and 100% legit. I've been trading on the platform since 2018 without any issues. Similar to gaming apps, Alpha network has a direct easy-to-use application where users can sign in using their email or Facebook account, push a button and earn 0.5 coins per hour until the 500 million coin supply is exhausted. The app also has a “boost” feature that allows users to watch 15-second ads to earn extra coins. Users can also increase their mining rate by inviting others to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphanetwork.alphaminer"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphanetwork.alphaminer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoneum ( PHT) - referral code -  4fwf3aun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Use the above code to claim 200 free PHT coins as bonus)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHT cloud earning or Phoneum is a very straight forward app with attractive app with a lot of functionality such as VIP Miners and as well as regular miners. And unlike other apps you have to click on PHT Cloud Earning app once a week. However hash rate or the speed of mining on this app is little low, but this app is cloud based and its not going to use any computational power from your phone except for little space for app. So, you can use this app, and hey you're doing pretty much nothing, so if it brings some value in future so its worth mining. But I wouldn't say this is a similar to Pi, but its free with legit details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoneum is one of the new age mobile only crypto currencies that can be mined only from the mobile phone. The team behind Phoneum is building a community of users who would socialize the Phoneum coin, PHT as it is called. The Phoneum ecosystem has an app (available on iOS and Android) which can be used to mine the PHT coins, then several mobile games that keep users engaged and incentivize them to earn more coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: -&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloud.earning"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloud.earning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Earning PHT or Phoneum referral code - 4fwf3aun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from them, if you still looking for more crypto mining apps even if they looks fishy with their details, UI and the permission they need from your mobile, so here is list of those crypto mining apps, but I won’t recommend these apps, because there are only 1 to 5 percent chances that there coins will be worth something in near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midoin (Android &amp;amp; iOS), CowCow (Android), Spotter (Android), Reflex (Android), AntCoin (Android), Eagle Network (Android), Thundercore Hub (Android), Swissborg Community App (Android)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need referrals codes-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are mining with any crypto mining apps, either on Android or iOS, so you can also refer these crypto mining apps to friends or relatives or people and it will increase your hash rate as well as their hash rate too. But make sure your referral is actively mining, because only than your hash rate will increase if they will be active (click at-least once in day on an app). If you are new and looking to join these apps and want referral codes? So, you can use my referral codes and I’m so active on below mentioned 5 apps. Make sure to choose someone who is always active, like I am, as this will improve your own mining rate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pi Network reference code: crypto18&lt;br&gt;
Bee Network reference code: crypto18&lt;br&gt;
Alpha Network reference code: crypto18&lt;br&gt;
TimeStope witness code:  crypto18&lt;br&gt;
Cloud Earning PHT or Phoneum (PHT) reference code: 4fwf3aun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, if you will look closely for certain points, so you can easily find some real or genuine cypto mining apps like Pi Network. And those points are, Permission needed for these apps, review on app store, ratio of reviews and download on app stores, White papers, founders or organization behind these (because if someone is taking responsibility so it’s always good thing in reference to those ghost apps, who just pop-ups on app store with some website out of nowhere and some ghosts are running that.

      <title>Designing web accessible video calls</title>
      <author>Jess Mitchell</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 21:23:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/trydaily/designing-web-accessible-video-calls-3852</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/trydaily/designing-web-accessible-video-calls-3852</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tips-from-daily-on-how-we-implement-accessible-uis-to-ensure-everyone-can-connect-online-through-video"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tips from Daily on how we implement accessible UIs to ensure everyone can connect online through video
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major goal of ours at Daily is to build video and audio APIs that work for as many people as possible. This means not only building high quality APIs, but also building UIs (user interfaces) that accommodate more than just an imaginary “average user”; we want &lt;a href="https://daily.co/prebuilt"&gt;Daily Prebuilt&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://dashboard.daily.co/"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href="https://docs.daily.co/"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; to be accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way we’ve worked towards this at Daily is to build our UIs following web accessibility standards from the start. Internally, we use a component library with components that have all been built to meet &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"&gt;these basic standards&lt;/a&gt;, which means all of our UIs using this library have accessibility baked in. 🍞 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we’ll review web accessibility basics, and take a look at how we’ve implemented web accessibility in Daily’s own UIs. We know a site's accessibility can almost always be improved — and this is something we’re committed to working on continuously. However, if you’re building video apps for the first time (or even the second or third), we hope that some of the steps we’ve taken can inspire your own designs.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-accessibility-what-exactly-is-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web accessibility: What exactly is it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/initiate/#learn-the-basics"&gt;Web accessibility&lt;/a&gt; refers to making website information and interactions available to everyone, regardless of barriers, such as disability, geography, language, device restrictions, and more. These barriers may be temporary, such as a broken arm, or permanent, such as a visual impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The term “accessibility” is sometimes written as “a11y”, which is a numeronym. (There are 11 letters between the first letter (“a”) and last letter (“y”). Hence, a11y. 😉)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-benefits-from-web-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who benefits from web accessibility?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of who web accessibility is for, it truly benefits everyone. We want to emphasize that because even people who don’t &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; accessible websites still benefit from them. 🙌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessible websites are often just better designed websites. Basic accessibility guidelines—like making sure your font size is large enough or your colour palette is high contrast enough—make the website easier for everyone to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when accessibility is not considered, there are often specific groups of people who are affected most. &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/"&gt;This includes people with&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive impairments (e.g. memory impairments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson’s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical, visual, auditory, or speech impairments (e.g. colour blindness, reduction in fine motor skills)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporary impairments (e.g. broken arm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor network conditions (e.g. slow page load times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small or old devices (e.g. reduced CPU capacity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pour-principles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  POUR Principles
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html"&gt;WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)&lt;/a&gt; outline four principles for web accessibility, also known as the POUR principles. These principles are incredibly useful for testing whether a website meets the goals set out by &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/"&gt;web accessibility standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POUR is an acronym for perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. These principles represent the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Perceivable&lt;/em&gt;: Websites should be perceivable, i.e. available to the senses, such as vision, touch, and hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Operable&lt;/em&gt;: Users can interact with any elements on a webpage that are meant to be interacted with regardless of the device they’re using (e.g. mouse, keyboard, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Understandable&lt;/em&gt;: Websites should be easy to understand regardless of how they’re read (e.g. visually, screen reader, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Robust&lt;/em&gt;: Websites should maximize how compatible they are with various browsers, devices, operating systems, network conditions, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#web-accessibility-at-daily"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Web Accessibility at Daily
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve done a quick overview of what web accessibility is, let’s take a look at some of the ways Daily has made its UIs accessible. This is not a complete list of how we incorporate accessibility into Daily products, but we hope this helps give some inspiration with your own apps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list we’ll cover today includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making all UI elements keyboard-accessible, including how we use focus traps and avoid keyboard traps to enhance keyboard navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding skip links in Daily’s Dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special treatment of “hidden” elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using semantic HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-all-interactive-ui-elements-keyboardaccessible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making all interactive UI elements keyboard-accessible
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to make websites more accessible is to make sure your audience can always interact with your site without a mouse. The idea is to make sure any element on the page that can be interacted with can be interacted with in multiple ways, whether it be a keyboard, mouse, or other device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the site visitor should be able to tab through elements, submit forms or inputs, or escape optional views, like modals, without using a mouse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example below, notice how a participant can join a call and move through Daily Prebuilt’s video call UI only with a keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7okS6zr5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.07.03.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7okS6zr5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.07.03.gif" alt="Tabbing through Daily Prebuilt video"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is ideal because we never want site visitors to feel like they can’t join a call or, worse, can’t leave a call once they’ve joined. No one should ever feel “stuck” moving through the user flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious what tabbing through a Daily call is like with a screen reader, watch this example below, which is using a &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn/related?hl=en"&gt;screen reader Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mtV9RSeI05o"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-focus-traps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding focus traps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of helping non-mouse users is to include focus traps in your websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus traps refer to traps (or loops) of focusable elements within a parent element on the page. A common example of when to use this is with a modal. When a site visitor opens a modal, if they tab through the contents of the modal and get to the end, tabbing again should bring the user back to the first tabbable element in the modal. This is in contrast to another, less accessible option: continuing to tab to the next element in the DOM—past the modal— while the modal is still open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7okS6zr5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.07.03.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7okS6zr5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.07.03.gif" alt="Tabbing through Settings modal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason focus traps are useful is because we can assume while the modal is open, the modal is the only element the visitor is trying to interact with until they close it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#avoiding-keyboard-traps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Avoiding keyboard traps
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, are “traps” bad or good? Well, it depends! We now know why focus traps are good for accessibility, but is there ever a time where trapping the focus is bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can probably tell from the name of this section: yes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “keyboard trap” refers to when an element can be focused but can’t be unfocused. The site visitor gets trapped on an element if they’re only using a keyboard. Since some users can’t use a mouse, any action a site visitor takes with a keyboard should be able to be undone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is if you open a modal to change your username in a Daily call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first example below, we see a modal with a username form and one button to change the name. If I’m only using a keyboard, there’s no button to close the modal or cancel changing my name. If the keyboard’s &lt;code&gt;Escape&lt;/code&gt; key doesn’t close the modal either, I’ll have to fill out the form to get back to the video call. This is what we don’t want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zUXNp6qB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4m0y33urz0dbhb7dmmcj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zUXNp6qB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4m0y33urz0dbhb7dmmcj.png" alt="Bad example of a modal with no way out"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s compare that scenario to how Daily Prebuilt’s username form is actually set up: The modal can be closed with a keyboard’s &lt;code&gt;Escape&lt;/code&gt; key or by pressing the &lt;code&gt;Cancel&lt;/code&gt; button. The call participant is never forced to change their username if the username modal has been opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NT49Rtaj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3ty2tktij2wa2pwdqm8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NT49Rtaj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m3ty2tktij2wa2pwdqm8.png" alt="Better example of a modal with a cancel button"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-skip-links-to-dailys-dashboard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding skip links to Daily’s Dashboard
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another web accessibility feature that can help non-mouse users a lot is to add skip links to websites with navigation bars or a lot of links in the header. Skip links are links that are styled to be off screen unless they’re tabbed to, which means you don’t see them if you’re using a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can include more than one skip link; ideally, you want to give site visitors the option of skipping to whichever section of the page they may want to jump to without having to tab through the entire page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of this, let’s look at Daily’s Dashboard. If you’re looking at the &lt;a href="https://dashboard.daily.co/recordings"&gt;Recordings page&lt;/a&gt; and want to get to the &lt;code&gt;Learn how to retrieve rtp-tracks recordings&lt;/code&gt; link, you have to tab through the header and nav bar to get to the main content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FDDd1YGK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.20.47.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FDDd1YGK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.20.47.gif" alt="Tabbing through Dashboard header and nav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this easier to navigate by keyboard, we can add two skip links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Skip to navigation&lt;/code&gt; to avoid having to tab through the header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Skip to main&lt;/code&gt; to avoid tabbing through the header and nav bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are already on the &lt;code&gt;Recordings&lt;/code&gt; page in the example below, we can skip right to the main content with one tab and open that first link. 🎊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HjdTWsRr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.25.11-1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HjdTWsRr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://www.daily.co/blog/content/images/2021/09/CleanShot-2021-09-01-at-11.25.11-1.gif" alt="Using skip links to skip to main content"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create these skip links in the Daily Dashboard, we added two anchor tags to the top of our Dashboard header:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"skip-link"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#main"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     Skip to main content
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"skip-link"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#nav"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
     Skip to navigation
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, we style them to not show by default and instead only show when they are being focused on. We do this by clipping the links to be 1 x 1px, and updating the &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; property only when they’re focused.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.skip-link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;white-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;nowrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.skip-link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:focus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we add an id attribute (&lt;code&gt;#main&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#nav&lt;/code&gt;) to the associated elements so clicking the link (the anchor tag) brings the focus to that part of the page. The end result is that all the content between the link and the target (i.e. the header and the nav bar) gets skipped in the tab order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#special-treatment-of-hidden-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Special treatment of “hidden” elements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines of skip links, there are other times when an element may be off screen. One example is when icons are used for buttons and we want screen readers to know how to interpret them, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-hidden-labels-for-screen-readers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating hidden labels for screen readers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we handle this at Daily is by using a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;VisuallyHidden&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; React component in the button contents, which is really just a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with text that is styled to not be visible. This means the screen reader can read it but site visitors who can visually see the UI will just see the icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note when you are visually hiding an element meant for a screen reader, you should not use &lt;code&gt;visible:hidden;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;display:none;&lt;/code&gt;. Both of these CSS properties will hide the element visually &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; hide it from a screen reader, which is not what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, like in the previous skip link example, we want to style it to only not be visually shown. There are a few ways to do this, so let’s look at how we hide text in Daily’s component library:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;VisuallyHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;jsx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
     span {
       clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
       height: 1px;
       overflow: hidden;
       position: absolute;
       white-space: nowrap;
       width: 1px;
     }
   `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar to the skip link, we clip the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to be 1 x 1px and hide any overflowing content. This successfully prevents the text from being seen while still letting the screen reader read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.daily.co/reference#properties"&gt;Daily Prebuilt full screen button&lt;/a&gt; is one example where this &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;VisuallyHidden&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component is used. Since it is just a full screen icon in the Prebuilt UI, we add text to make it more descriptive for a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure it can be read properly by screen readers, a span with the text  “Enter full screen” is included in the HTML but not shown in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2ZmPxKJX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/21vcd9wjaxr8a65gjzc5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2ZmPxKJX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/21vcd9wjaxr8a65gjzc5.png" alt="DOM shows span that isn't visible in the call UI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#removing-hidden-elements-from-the-tab-order"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Removing hidden elements from the tab order
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of special treatment of hidden elements is removing an element from the tab order if it is in the DOM but the site visitor is not meant to be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, tooltips included in Daily Prebuilt are not shown unless hovered over. These tooltips don’t need to be read by the screen reader while the call participant tabs through the call elements because the buttons they’re related to are already being described by the screen reader.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tooltip&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ctrlKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; + D`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tabIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TrayButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggleMic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MicrophoneIcon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;buttonText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/TrayButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Tooltip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, we can remove the tooltip from the tab order with the attribute &lt;code&gt;tabindex=”-1”&lt;/code&gt;. This will prevent the tooltip from getting keyboard focus, which will prevent the screen reader from reading the tooltip’s text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-semantic-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using semantic HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic ways we’re committed to accessibility at Daily is using semantic HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic HTML refers to HTML elements that describe the element content. For example, if you are building a web form, writing the form with semantic HTML would use a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, with an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=”submit”&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the end to submit the form. In essence, you always want to use the element that represents what the element actually is (such as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, an unordered list &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) This is in contrast to using non-semantic HTML, which would use a vaguer container element, like a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic HTML helps communicate to the browser (and developer reading the code!) what each section of your markup is. This also makes it easier for screen readers to understand how to read the page’s content to its listener, and it makes the page more SEO-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's win-win for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, these examples are just a few ways our frontend team at Daily—&lt;a href="https://www.daily.co/blog/author/christian/"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;, especially—is ensuring Daily products are accessible to everyone. We still have some areas to improve, but we do our best to ensure our product UIs are accessible at launch. 💫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some additional tips we didn’t have space to go into include always labelling form inputs, testing color palettes to meet &lt;a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"&gt;color contrast requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and actually testing websites with screen reader tools, like a &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/accessibility/reference/"&gt;screen reader Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing with screen reader extensions are not only useful for developers, but they also help show what it’s really like to rely on a screen reader to navigate the web.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CryptominingApp - Pi Network Review and Crypto Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, you have installed Pi Network app, but if you haven't so you should install it, because 23 millions users are already mining and and this app is developed and backed by Stanford University PhDs, and they do regular online seminars and presentation to involve miners. Pi network is one of the most trusted app foe crypto mining. You can join free mining pool before listing and earn some or more coins because with some research reports it is expected that Pi coins will bring some good value from $10 to $100 by the end of 2025 or maybe it can be next bitcoin because of miners. Pi Netowrk will stop mining when it will reach 100 million miners and till now 23 million miners are on board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pi Network, is kind of the first digital currency that you can mine on your phone," has become a popular topic of discussion on social media and these days many apps are copying the same model and mode of operations after evaluating the feasibility of the project. With the soaring price of Bitcoin, we no longer have a chance to own Bitcoin, but you can mine Pi for free and that too without any investment. Here you are losing nothing, but with 5 seconds of day, if the project succeeds, each Pi could be worth 10 to 100 U.S. dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a new user you will receives one free Pi and starts with a mining speed of 0.10 Pi per hour, which will increase with more accepted referrals. As per some experts the estimates about the Pi's value, is now worth $10-100 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently no official trading market for Pi neither its listed in any exchange, but with the launch of main-net in start of 2022, Pi coins will be available for trading in some exchanges and with time its value will increase as it has user base of more than 24 million miners. A typical cryptocurrency owner usually has a private key to access his or her funds, but Pi users do not, which means it is unlikely that they will be able to transfer or spend the currency. This also means that Pi currency only exists on servers and administrators can create as many Pi’s as they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pi Network is a legit or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make money with cryptocurrencies, Pi Network claims you can do so for free by installing an app on your phone. But, as cool as it sounds, I’m sure you’ll agree that it’s all too good to be true. In fact, you may have already heard people calling Pi Network a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pi Network is a mobile application where you can mine a cryptocurrency called Pi. All you have to do is log-in everyday and click a button, and you have to do none investment, but just 5 seconds a day. The app’s users get nothing but basic features like in-app messaging. Most users hope to one day exchange their virtual coins for real money. With the research paper of Pi network and their future plans along with the list of most reputed founders of tech industry its sure that Pi network is going to be successful for sure and 1 Pi can be worth 1 to 10 dollars easily in next 2 to 3 years. Pi Network’s coin value is zero at the moment. However, people behind this project promised Pi holders can spend or exchange their Pi for fiat currency on the Pi marketplace. Using the app is as simple as clicking to receive Pi every 24 hours. It’s difficult to see how this action could be valuable. While Pi Network encourages developers to build apps on the platform, it does little for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Mine PI Cryptocurrency?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pi Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow these simple instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--Go to the App Store or Google Play, depending on the type of your operating system.&lt;br&gt;
--Type Pi Network into the search gap.&lt;br&gt;
--Download the application on your smartphone and open it.&lt;br&gt;
--Specify the registration method: Facebook or phone number. We recommend the second option since it is much safer.&lt;br&gt;
--Fill in the country of residence and phone number.&lt;br&gt;
--Fill in first name, last name and nickname.&lt;/p&gt;

Bee network, almost similar to Pi app and in short we can say that it's almost copy of Pi apps, which means Bee's success so far is based on Pi's success. I know it should ring panic alarm because it's for a big part of a copy-paste project, but in reality this happens all the time and doesn't always mean it's a scam, like; Bitcoin BEP2, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and they all are kind of similar and successful too. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Phoneum (PHT) Legit? for Cryptomining </title>
      <author>Rishi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 20:59:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cryptomininggyd/is-phoneum-pht-legit-for-cryptomining-3354</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cryptomininggyd/is-phoneum-pht-legit-for-cryptomining-3354</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CryptominingApp - Phoneum (PHT) Review and Crypto Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHT cloud earning or Phoneum is a very straight forward app with attractive app with a lot of functionality such as VIP Miners and as well as regular miners. And unlike other apps you have to click on PHT Cloud Earning app once a week. However hash rate or the speed of mining on this app is little low, but this app is cloud based and its not going to use any computational power from your phone except for little space for app. So, you can use this app, and hey you're doing pretty much nothing, so if it brings some value in future so its worth mining. But I wouldn't say this is a similar to Pi, but its free with legit details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoneum is one of the new age mobile only crypto currencies that can be mined only from the mobile phone. The team behind Phoneum is building a community of users who would socialize the Phoneum coin, PHT as it is called. The Phoneum ecosystem has an app (available on iOS and Android) which can be used to mine the PHT coins, then several mobile games that keep users engaged and incentivize them to earn more coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to mine Phoneum (PHT): -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Mining of Phoneum (PHT) Coin, you will need its app, you should read this article carefully before downloading the application. We are saying this because you do not face any kind of problem after installing the application. If you will open a cloud application every 7 days and start cloud mining, then we get about 70 PTH coins every week. That is, we get 10 coins every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the easiest things to do. PHT mining is done on the cloud. So, on your phone, similar to the Pi app, you just have to open the app and click on mine. Unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoins etc, you dont need large infrastructures or big rigs to mine these tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to claim for extra reward: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reward you get from inviting does not depend on how many coins you will receive; it depends on whom you have invited. How many sessions does he complete? The person you invited completes two sessions, that is, 2 weeks of cloud mining, you will get 400+ PHT Coin Rewards, 5 weeks of Mining Sessions will be available for 1000+ PHT Coin Rewards, and After completing the 10-week mining session, 2000+ PHT Coin Rewards will be available. After this, you will not get any more coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up by using referral code - 4fwf3aun now and get 200 PHT bonus coins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much Phoneum is available in market: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a total of 2 Billion PHT coins in supply. Of this in a given 24hour period, only about a million coins are traded, indicating low liquidity. As of now, the crypto is extensively traded only on the Probit exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have hit mine, the app mines for a total of 7 days and then stops. Then, you need to log in again to make it mine again. So you need to sign into the app every 7 days to claim the previously mined coins and then click mine again to start earning more PHTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoneum (PHT) is listed on Exchange: -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phoneum (PHT) Token is already listed on the Probit Exchange, on February 18, one of its coins is priced at $ 0.0002824, which is 0.01997 in Indian Rupees. Right now, you must be looking at this price, but just as the price of 1 bitcoin was $ 0.08 in the year 2008, similarly its price is so low in today’s time. In the coming times, Phoneum (PHT) can make a good price in the Token market, so you should start collecting it from today. Right now, talking about the price of Phoneum (PHT) Coin, the price of one coin is $ 0.0002824, which is 0.01997 in Indian rupees. It is true that this application is very slow, that is, the value of the coin mined by this application is very low. But the price of a coin reaches $ 1 in the coming years, so you can understand how much profit you are going to make. Now make sure that you have to do Phoneum (PHT) Token mining or not? Below is the link, on which you can earn a 200 PHT coin bonus by clicking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloud.earning"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloud.earning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whitepaper: - &lt;a href="https://phoneum.io/"&gt;https://phoneum.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need Phoneum (PHT) code-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you planning to mining on Phoneum (PHT) for free to generate some PHT coins, so you need invitation from an existing trusted member of Phoneum (PHT), so if you have an invitation you can download the mobile app and start mining or you can use my invitation code to mine on Network, because to get better mining speed you should make sure that your circle is full of active people like I am. With the active circle you will get better mining rate as well as members in your circle will also get better mining rate because of your activity, so make sure to choose someone who is active (can click on an app at-least ones in 7 day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoneum ( PHT) referral code - 4fwf3aun (to claim 200 free PHT coins as bonus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Alpha Network Legit? for Cryptomining </title>
      <author>Rishi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 20:46:38 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CryptominingApp - Alpha Network Review and Crypto Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha coins are very reliable and 100% legit. I've been trading on the platform since 2018 without any issues. Similar to gaming apps, Alpha network has a direct easy-to-use application where users can sign in using their email or Facebook account, push a button and earn 0.5 coins per hour until the 500 million coin supply is exhausted. The app also has a “boost” feature that allows users to watch 15-second ads to earn extra coins. Users can also increase their mining rate by inviting others to join. With Alpha Network you can earn cryptocurrency from your phone by pressing a button every 24 hours. There are a few ways in which you can increase the amount of Alpha coins you earn per hour. But before we go into that, have a look at their presentation video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, developers added a Loot-Box feature allowing users to open a box with rewards and triple the reward by watching an ad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Network referral code: crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Phases in Alpha Network:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha network app was launched in April 2021 for Android devices, and developers aim to expand the scope of the project over 3 phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--Launching mining apps for Google play and Apple store, as well as developing a wallet app within 3-6 months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--Launching the wallet app and allowing users to perform transactions. Developers also state that following steps are “big and will be revealed at the time”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--At this phase, the initial mining pool of 500 million coins will be used up as more users join, and the developers will release a physical mining node (PMN) software for PCs and the users will participate in the decision making about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mining on Alpha Network and Its user-base:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has been structured in three phases in order to create an easy-to-understand overview of the development plan from the team. Each phase represents a milestone for Alpha Network and can be triggered by a specific event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the project proposes the launch of the initial Alpha Network miner app which enables players to start contributing to the system by earning alpha coin. This is handled for both Android and iOS devices in a staged manner with an initial release on Android followed by iOS. The phase continues with general improvements to the platform until the Alpha Network Wallet app is ready for the market, which we expect to be anywhere from 3 to 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Store: - &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphanetwork.alphaminer"&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphanetwork.alphaminer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Whitepaper: - &lt;a href="https://www.minealpha.net/whitepaper"&gt;https://www.minealpha.net/whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need Alpha Network code-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is an invitation from an existing trusted member on the network. If you have an invitation you can download the mobile app. If you looking for start and need reference codes, so you can use my reference codes because you need a referral code to join most of these networks. When you use someone’s code, they get a better mining rate. Make sure to choose someone who is always active, like I am, as this will improve your own mining rate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timestope is south Korean project with some background in technology and cryptocurrencies. It seems Timestope is consist of team of a legit people in a company that's already been making apps for some time. There are chances in future their currency will have some better value as they are also running some other dApps from their own platform.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does TimeStope Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis of TimeStope is to be a witness. Only those who have been invited by the witness can create the TIME through TimeStope, and 9.6τ is distributed to the inviter every day. When the mining period expires, you must witness for someone other than the inviter who invited you and the person you invited, and the attendance score will be reset.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is 100 attendance point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attendance score is 100 points for initial participation. Attendance must be checked in the attendance book within 24h hours based on UTC. If you check attendance, your attendance score increases by 2 points, and if you do not check attendance, your attendance score decreases by 3 points. Keep in mind that if you are absent for exactly 31 days, that participant will not be able to join in the TimeStope permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the attendance score reaches a certain score, the transferable amount per year increases. For example, when the attendance score reaches 300 points, the number of sending per year increases from 10,000τ to 500,000τ, and when it finally reaches 10,000 points, the number of sending per year is infinite and can be transmitted without limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you need Timestope Witness (referral) code-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an invitation you can download the mobile app. If you looking for start and need witness (referral) codes, so you can use my referral codes because you need a referral code to join most of these networks. When you use someone’s code, they get a better mining rate. Make sure to choose someone who is always active, like I am, as this will improve your own mining rate too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timestope Witness (referral) code:  crypto18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How much can you earn on UpWork before you give up?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rimutaka/how-much-can-you-earn-on-upwork-before-you-give-up-3mha</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-brief-analysis-of-actual-upwork-earnings-for-software-developers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A brief analysis of actual UpWork earnings for software developers
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; The sooner you give up, the more you earn elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In case you don't know what &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com"&gt;UpWork&lt;/a&gt; is, it is a leading freelance marketplace. They are a publicly listed company with $338M revenue in 2020. Anyone can post a job there, and most professionals can offer their services at the cost of 20% of their earnings. The platform provides no vetting for employers and minimal vetting for freelancers leaving it to the feedback system to weed out bad players. It is one of the better ones out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to hire on UpWork for our startup. It was an easy way to get things done on a shoestring budget. The results were a mixed bag. Most of the work was either a complete throw-away or prototype-level quality.&lt;br&gt;
We got what we paid for, but there were a few outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#highquality-freelancers-are-outliers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  High-quality freelancers are outliers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite considering bids only from freelancers with excellent feedback and &lt;a href="https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211068358"&gt;90%+ Job Success Score&lt;/a&gt; our hit rate was about 1 in 10 for "acceptable" and 1 in 20 for "great". We were lucky to hire some really good freelancers from remote (to us) places like Moldova, Macedonia and Turkey. They were up and coming, had reasonable rates and appreciated the constant stream of work we were sending them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#paying-more-doesnt-get-you-more-quality"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Paying more doesn't get you more quality
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be a pretty low ceiling on the quality of the workforce there. Assuming that our job ads were well-written, simply offering more money didn't bring better quality bids. None of the higher-cost freelancers we tried ended up on our regulars list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freelancers-lifetime-value"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Freelancer's lifetime value
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got in touch with 11 out of 13 UpWork freelancers we hired on a regular basis. To my surprise, none of them was still using UpWork or any other freelance marketplace. Only 3 continued with casual contract work mostly through referrals from past clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all had a different story to tell, but the common theme was that the jobs on UpWork were hard to get, many employers had no idea what they were doing and the pay was below the market rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how much do freelancers make before they move off the platform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the total earnings of 100 freelancers in &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/ab/profiles/search/?category_uid=531770282580668418&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;q=rust"&gt;search results for Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pWtI9cKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/upwork-earnings-breakdown-2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pWtI9cKJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/upwork-earnings-breakdown-2.png" alt="UpWork earnings breakdown"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/plwc3u/im_just_tired_of_bidding_for_work_with_no/"&gt;you don't give up before landing that very first job&lt;/a&gt;, the chances are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 quits before earning $1,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 quits before earning $10,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/3 quits before reaching $100,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rest stays for a long haul and makes UpWork a significant source of their income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#highearner-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  High-earner list
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not all doom and gloom. You can make a decent living in some categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 out of 100 freelancers in my search for a Rust engineer had over $100k of total earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~017778f12a2565f8f4"&gt;$185,288&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0147f8ce8730c3d633"&gt;$210,023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01f24fb7d3fa638cfa"&gt;$277,418&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010ba56ab4bc5aba48"&gt;$281,584&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0144b974ba8a3d287f"&gt;$295,363&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~010f4e6ae0c1778aae"&gt;$425,345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01aa1b7467b4eb49bc"&gt;$673,153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01364b7feb73f1d7ae"&gt;$921,241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d95397aacaef6e88"&gt;$1,000,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1000000-club-do-you-want-to-be-a-member"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  $1,000,000 club - do you want to be a member?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01d95397aacaef6e88"&gt;Evgeniy T. from Catalonia&lt;/a&gt; tops our list with $1M+ of lifetime earnings. We don't know exactly how much he earned, but let's assume it is a million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--70YrUbeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/one-million-dollars-club.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--70YrUbeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rimutaka/posts/master/upwork-earnings/one-million-dollars-club.png" alt="One Million Dollar Club"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earning one million dollars sounds very inspirational. Who doesn't want to be a millionaire! Let's break it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1,000,000 / 18,076 hrs worked = $55 per hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;period over 10 years (started in 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;$117k per year&lt;/strong&gt; if adjusted for inflation and UpWork fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we disregard the intangible values such as freedom this type of work brings, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$117k per year for someone with 10 years of full-stack experience is a rather low figure in today's world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same high-earners list doesn't look as impressive on an annual basis, except maybe entry #3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~017778f12a2565f8f4/details"&gt;$185,288&lt;/a&gt; / 5 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~0147f8ce8730c3d633/details"&gt;$210,023&lt;/a&gt; / 12 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01f24fb7d3fa638cfa/details"&gt;$277,418&lt;/a&gt; / 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~010ba56ab4bc5aba48/details"&gt;$281,584&lt;/a&gt; / 12 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~0144b974ba8a3d287f/details"&gt;$295,363&lt;/a&gt; / 6 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~010f4e6ae0c1778aae/details"&gt;$425,345&lt;/a&gt; / 11 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01aa1b7467b4eb49bc/details"&gt;$673,153&lt;/a&gt; / 12 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01364b7feb73f1d7ae/details"&gt;$921,241&lt;/a&gt; / 9 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/api/v1/freelancer/profile/~01d95397aacaef6e88/details"&gt;$1,000,000&lt;/a&gt; / 10 years &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, UpWork is no better or worse than any other career path. It does a good job of putting you in front of employers. If you are good and want to be poached, you most likely will be, &lt;a href="https://www.upwork.com/legal#OPTINGOUT"&gt;despite what the Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt; say.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hey-are-you-open-to-offers-of-better-employment-or-more-contract-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hey, are you open to offers of better employment or more contract work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am building a &lt;a href="https://stackmuncher.com"&gt;software engineer search engine&lt;/a&gt; for devs like you and me to be discovered by employers looking for our skills. It is a community-first and fully open-source project that takes no commission or charges placement fees. Head to &lt;a href="https://stackmuncher.com/about/developers/"&gt;https://stackmuncher.com/about/developers/&lt;/a&gt; and let interesting and well-paid work find you &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding docker - playing with ruby containers</title>
      <author>Ana Nunes da Silva</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 19:49:35 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/anakbns/understanding-docker-playing-with-ruby-containers-4gle</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-the-basics-of-docker-and-docker-commands-is-the-first-step-into-app-containerization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding the basics of docker and docker commands is the first step into app containerization.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;... When you first get into the docker world it can be a bit daunting to understand how all of these tools work and relate to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll be playing around with a simple ruby container just using docker commands. No &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; for now. Just the basic docker commands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sure helped me really grasp the basic concepts behind images and containers in isolation before moving into more complex concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#images-vs-containers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Images vs Containers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In docker, it all begins with an image. The image sets the minimum base for a container to run. An image is an immutable file that will serve as a snapshot for the container, and the container will be the actual process on which you can work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might help to look at it with a programming mindset - think of an image as a class and the container as an instance of that class. A container is an instance of an image.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this exercise, I want to run a simple ruby sandbox with &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;. This sandbox will be available in a container but for this container to run I'll need its snapshot - the ruby image. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we don't have to build the ruby image ourselves. There are plenty of ready-made images available on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;Docker hub&lt;/a&gt; that you can use. If you search for &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; you'll find the official ruby image in different versions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-docker-run-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command that starts a container process from an image is &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's understand how the command works by starting a ruby container. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;docker run ruby&lt;/code&gt; for the first time, it will first fetch the ruby image in its latest version from the docker hub and download it into your local docker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll get an output similar to this one:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unable to find image &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'ruby:latest'&lt;/span&gt; locally
latest: Pulling from library/ruby
4c25b3090c26: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;1acf565088aa: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;b95c0dd0dc0d: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;5cf06daf6561: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;942374d5c114: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;420c5b579440: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;cdfe7730cd5c: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;bfeceb400e58: Pull &lt;span class="nb"&gt;complete 
&lt;/span&gt;Digest: sha256:8849efdb1f006c5d7b26980f3aeb15f00fa2b5428cfbef8761aef5fc87491b89
Status: Downloaded newer image &lt;span class="k"&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;ruby:3.0.2
Switch to inspect mode.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, it looks like nothing happened yet but it does say that it downloaded the ruby image successfully. How can I confirm that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-docker-images-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;docker images&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;docker images&lt;/code&gt; you will see that you'll have the ruby with the &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; tag available for you. You should see something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REPOSITORY     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ruby           latest    b28f54b6ce55   3 days ago    881MB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the created timestamp you see in the docker images list is the date that the image was added to the docker library and not the date of the download to your local docker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to our command, it should have also started a container based on this image but where is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-raw-docker-ps-endraw-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; to list all the running containers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list is empty. Why? The run command should have started a new container process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &lt;code&gt;docker ps -a&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; is the flag to show all containers (running and exited), your container will be there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES                
948b3179783a   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    10 seconds ago   Exited &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 5 seconds ago                eager_snyder  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Look at the Status column. It reads &lt;code&gt;Exited (0) 5 seconds ago&lt;/code&gt;. But why was this container exited? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not have noticed, amongst the printed download messages, but there was an error message at the end. Let's see that message again by re-running the docker run command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker run ruby
Switch to inspect mode.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is because the ruby image by default sends &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; as a command to the container. Once the container process is opened the &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; command should run. But the container cannot run &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; unless we tell it to run in the interactive terminal mode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: the process was opened, the container ran &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, got the error message, the process was closed right after it, exiting the container with it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can run any command with the interactive terminal mode using the &lt;code&gt;-it&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; ruby
irb&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:001:0&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, our sandbox is running!  🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and play with ruby a bit.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;irb&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:001:0&amp;gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'hello'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'world'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.join&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;', '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.capitalize
&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Hello, world"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you exit &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;,  open another terminal window and run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
2ef882ad2b5b   ruby:latest   &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;     4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             elated_satoshi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There it is! We have a running container! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now exit &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; again. It's empty. If you run &lt;code&gt;docker ps -a&lt;/code&gt; you should see your container there. It has an exited status again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
2ef882ad2b5b   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    6 minutes ago    Exited &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 47 seconds ago             elated_satoshi
948b3179783a   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    15 minutes ago   Exited &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 15 minutes ago             eager_snyder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We've just learned another essential aspect of containers. &lt;strong&gt;The container has one main process. If that process stops, the container stops.&lt;/strong&gt; When we left &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, the process stopped and the container was exited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that we have two stopped containers. The first container with the random name &lt;code&gt;elated_satoshi&lt;/code&gt; is the one we've just opened and closed after playing with &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, and the last one &lt;code&gt;eager_snyder&lt;/code&gt; is the container that was created when we ran the command without the interactive terminal flag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;every time you run the ruby image, you're creating a different container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#passing-other-commands-to-the-container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Passing other commands to the container
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've seen that running &lt;code&gt;docker run -it ruby&lt;/code&gt; is the same as running  &lt;code&gt;docker -it ruby irb&lt;/code&gt;. We omit it because that's the default for ruby, but we can pass other commands for the container to run once it's opened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we run &lt;code&gt;docker run -it ruby bash&lt;/code&gt; we will create an interactive bash shell in the container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; ruby bash
root@b1c73a63eef9:/# &lt;span class="nb"&gt;ls
&lt;/span&gt;bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@b1c73a63eef9:/# ruby &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt;
ruby 3.0.2p107 &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;x86_64-linux]
root@b1c73a63eef9:/# 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stopping-and-removing-containers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stopping and removing containers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw earlier, every time you run the &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; command a new container will be created. This means that with time you'll get a big list of stopped containers: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to remove stopped containers, you can just run &lt;code&gt;docker rm &amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the container is still running you might have to use the &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command before removing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker stop &amp;lt;container &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;container &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to avoid exited containers to be kept after the process is closed there's a useful flag you can use with &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;-rm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-ti&lt;/span&gt; ruby
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keeping-container-processes-open"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keeping container processes open
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that every time we left &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; in the previous exercises, we closed the process and the container. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a way you can exit yourself from the process without closing it. If you use &lt;code&gt;ctrl+p&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;ctrl+q&lt;/code&gt;, you will no longer see the process but it will still be running in the background. If you run &lt;code&gt;docker ps -l&lt;/code&gt;, where the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; flag will get the latest container, you'll see your container there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to start a new container in the detached mode you can pass the detach flag, &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-ti&lt;/span&gt; ruby
e68f13762ee83ea315b3d0a679432dd1963f276deb387aa3bdce9b4801f21979
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It prints out the &lt;code&gt;container id&lt;/code&gt; for you, but again, you can also confirm that there's a new process running with &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
e68f13762ee8   ruby:latest  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;     4 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds             crazy_varahamihira
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to jump in the process again, you can run the &lt;code&gt;docker attach &amp;lt;container id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt; docker attach e68f13762ee8
irb&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:001:0&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also add a new process to the same container, with the &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; command. Imagine you have &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; running in the background but you want to jump in the bash:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker &lt;span class="nb"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; e68f13762ee8 bash
root@e68f13762ee8:/#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#naming-containers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Naming containers
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we noticed earlier, a container has a name but if you don't give it one, a random one will be assigned to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to give it a name, you can pass it in a &lt;code&gt;--name&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; ruby-sandbox &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-ti&lt;/span&gt; ruby&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now run &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; to make sure there's a container with that name:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                   PORTS     NAMES                
aee3cd98a190   ruby:latest              &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"irb"&lt;/span&gt;                    10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds                       ruby-sandbox  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-master-the-fundamentals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First master the fundamentals!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of commands were covered in this article but I believe that there is only a handful of fundamental concepts in docker. The goal of this article was to share a bit of the process and exercises I've gone through to understand what docker really is. It's a compilation of stuff I was first taught by my colleague &lt;a href="https://leandronsp.com/"&gt;Leandro&lt;/a&gt; (he has great content on this topic, go check him out) and that I also got from basic docker courses. Have fun! 🐳&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7 Useful VS Code extension for junior web developers</title>
      <author>Stefi Rosca</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 19:45:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/stefirosca/7-useful-vs-code-extension-for-junior-web-developers-3pg5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/stefirosca/7-useful-vs-code-extension-for-junior-web-developers-3pg5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my early days of coding I used to get quickly frustrated when my code didn't run. It felt like I was doing everything right but the web app still didn't work. Mostly it was a silly mistake, some sort of typo, a missed comma, bracket or semicolon. This made me question my potential of becoming a developer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More experienced developers always had fancy extensions and in the beginning I felt quite nervous downloading any. I didn't see the value and I didn't want to add stuff that might break my current setup or that I didn't quite understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the extensions I share below I became a bit more productive and spend less time debugging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-prettier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Prettier
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is a code formatter that you can set to automatically format your code on save. This will make it easier to read and write code as it removes unnecessary space and aligns everything well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Flow, JSX, JSON, CSS , SCSS, Less, HTML, Vue, Angular, GraphQL, Markdown and YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5fmPNVGG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u0z8x742go3zqaanvfa.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5fmPNVGG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u0z8x742go3zqaanvfa.gif" alt="Demo Prettier extension"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this extension format your code automatically on save you have to change this in settings as per the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20O1tqLc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y1quup7fsar69nj2peh3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20O1tqLc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y1quup7fsar69nj2peh3.png" alt="Settings - automatically format your code on save"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-highlight-matching-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Highlight Matching Tag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is useful to find matching opening and/or closing tags especially when having tags with a lot of tags inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jIPqrayN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68pwj26la1p0x9gare9z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jIPqrayN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68pwj26la1p0x9gare9z.png" alt="Demo Highlight Matching Tag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Highlight Matching Tag here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-auto-rename-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Auto Rename Tag
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to change maybe an h1 for an h3 or div for a ul? If so with this extension when you rename one HTML/XML tag, you can automatically rename the paired HTML/XML tag. Pretty useful I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pXq2HpAp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fnd8hsasvg654c8luvtj.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pXq2HpAp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fnd8hsasvg654c8luvtj.gif" alt="Demo Auto Rename Tag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-error-lens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Error Lens
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit annoying at times as I don't finish typing and it tells me something is missing but found it super useful for those forgotten brackets or commas. It highlights errors visibly right in the line where something is not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20I6caFq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oefz8qzd865hs99ola6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--20I6caFq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oefz8qzd865hs99ola6.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.46.00"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HUqTUZv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/do9n64p6nwz7jm8fj03s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HUqTUZv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/do9n64p6nwz7jm8fj03s.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.45.14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-live-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Live Server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A helpful extension when working on static websites - HTML, CSS and JS and no framework as you won't have to reload every time you make a change. After each save it will be automatically reload the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Live Server here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-sort-lines"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Sort Lines
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if one really needs this extensions but I've found that some people like to sort their CSS lines plus you look cool. Simply select the content you want to sort alphabetically and click: Keybound to F9 on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fyBDZeu5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4db11y7nb2jhtw3c3ik.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fyBDZeu5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4db11y7nb2jhtw3c3ik.gif" alt="Demo Sort Lines"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-bracket-pair-colorizer-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension highlights matching brackets with the same colour. This makes it easier to find a missing bracket. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demo without extension: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demo with extension:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7wCfndI4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm2wrhdjrx71rq2bjdm0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7wCfndI4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xm2wrhdjrx71rq2bjdm0.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-06 at 15.41.07"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although with the new VS Code update you could activate this functionality directly the IDE by setting the bracketPairColorization.enabled in the settings section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Get Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus extensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt; - super useful for debugging as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets"&gt;ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme"&gt;Material Icon Theme&lt;/a&gt; - makes your IDE more fancy looking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens"&gt;GitLens&lt;/a&gt; - helpful especially when working with others via source control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Do you use other extensions that you find useful? Please add them in the comments below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sass Crash Course in a Book</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤷‍♀️What is Sass
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sass (which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports, and more. It also helps to keep things organized and allows you to create style sheets faster. The benefit of using Sass is that sass is compatible with all versions of CSS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before continue, I encourage you to read this full article and then watch my sass crash course video which is only 15 minutes. This way your  Sass memory will remain much longer than usual.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--abp_T4br--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6s8wyvwxl2sgjjb6uzc0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--abp_T4br--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6s8wyvwxl2sgjjb6uzc0.png" alt="Sass course in a book by shahan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#01-store-data-with-sass-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  01. 📦Store Data with Sass Variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature of &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt; that's different than &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; is it uses &lt;strong&gt;variables&lt;/strong&gt;. They can be declared and set to &lt;em&gt;store data&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;variables&lt;/strong&gt; similar to &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, variables are declared using &lt;strong&gt;let&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;const&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;keywords.&lt;/em&gt; In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, variables start with a &lt;strong&gt;$&lt;/strong&gt; followed by the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;variable name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-is-a-real-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here is a real example🔻
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we need to use the success color '&lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt;' in different places without repeating its name. So, we need to write code like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$success-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we use this global variable in different places like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$sucess-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$success-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value👌.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#02-nest-css-with-sass"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  02. 🤏Nest CSS with Sass
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sass will let you &lt;strong&gt;nest&lt;/strong&gt; your &lt;strong&gt;CSS selectors&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without Nesting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Nesting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;child style rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; within the respective &lt;strong&gt;parent elements&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#03-create-reusable-css-with-mixins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  03. 🧣Create Reusable CSS with Mixins
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mixin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;group of CSS declarations&lt;/em&gt;. So we can &lt;strong&gt;reuse&lt;/strong&gt; them in our &lt;em&gt;style sheet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know newer CSS features take time before they are fully compatible with all browsers. As features are adopted to browsers, &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; rules using them may need &lt;strong&gt;vendor prefixes&lt;/strong&gt;. As an example b*&lt;em&gt;ox-shadow&lt;/em&gt;* &lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without Mixins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-webkit-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-moz-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-ms-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine, we have different types of cards on our website with different effects of box-shadow. It's a lot of typing to re-write this rule to support all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Mixins come in. Mixins are like JavaScript &lt;strong&gt;functions&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;. Here is how to write one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With Mixins:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-webkit-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-moz-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;-ms-box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$blur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The definition starts with @mixin followed by a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;custom name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The parameters (the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$x, $y, $blur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;$c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the example above) are optional. Now any time a &lt;strong&gt;box-shadow&lt;/strong&gt; rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the &lt;em&gt;vendor prefixes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to &lt;strong&gt;call @mixin&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/include"&gt;@include&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; directive. Have a look👇&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.popup-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#04-use-if-and-else-to-add-logic-to-your-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  04. 🔍Use @if and &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/else"&gt;@else&lt;/a&gt;
 to Add Logic To Your Styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sass, @if &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/else"&gt;@else&lt;/a&gt;
 statement is similar to JavaScript. It is very useful in Sass when we search for a specific condition before applying any styles. like so,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;danger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then this is how we need to apply this mixin in different places:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;danger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;additional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.sucess-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;bold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;additional&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#05-sass-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  05. ➰Sass @Loop
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sass has several loop options, much like other programming languages. They include the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;@for loop, @each loop, and @while loop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These loops are an incredibly powerful tool for generating &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt; code because you can defer code generation into an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iterable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E2%99%BEuse-for-to-create-a-sass-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ♾Use @for to Create a Sass Loop:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, @for is used in two ways: "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;start through end&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;" or "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;start to end&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;". The main difference between these two methods is that the &lt;strong&gt;"start to end"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;excludes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; numbers as part of the &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;"start through end"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;includes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; number as part of the &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is a **start through end&lt;/em&gt;* example:🔻*&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;through&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; { &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;#{$i}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; part is the syntax to combine a variable ( &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ) with text to make a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt;. So, when this Sass file is &lt;strong&gt;converted&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;, it will looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why @for is a powerful way to create a very long &lt;strong&gt;grid&lt;/strong&gt; layout or any &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; elements with just one line of code. Now you have 5 different text sizes for your website available as &lt;strong&gt;CSS classes&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"start to end"&lt;/strong&gt; is the same as &lt;strong&gt;"start through end"&lt;/strong&gt;. Just remember &lt;strong&gt;"start to end"&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;excludes&lt;/em&gt; the end number as part of the &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt;, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//The result will look like this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.text-5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here you can see the last count (6) is not included in this loop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-each-to-map-over-items-in-a-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏹Use @each to Map Over Items in a List
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;@each&lt;/strong&gt; rule makes it easy to emit styles or evaluate code for each element of a list or each pair in a map. Once each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the &lt;strong&gt;current value&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;list or map.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look without map:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look with Map:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;color2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;color3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see, the map has slightly different syntax just like JavaScript. So, here the &lt;strong&gt;$key&lt;/strong&gt; variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. If you don't supply &lt;strong&gt;$key&lt;/strong&gt;, the compiled CSS would have color1, color2... and will never touch the actual value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.red-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.green-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.yellow-text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-while-until-a-condition-is-met-to-apply-a-style"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔐Use @while Until a Condition is Met to Apply a Style:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sass&lt;/strong&gt;, there is no difference with the &lt;strong&gt;@while&lt;/strong&gt; directive compare to JavaScript. It creates &lt;strong&gt;CSS rules until a condition is met&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we use the &lt;strong&gt;@for&lt;/strong&gt; directive to create repeated tasks without duplication. It can be done with &lt;strong&gt;@while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;text-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt; { &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;}&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, first, we take a variable and set it to 1. Next, we check the condition with the &lt;strong&gt;@while&lt;/strong&gt; directive to create different sizes of text while $i is less than 6.  Make sure to &lt;strong&gt;increment&lt;/strong&gt; $i by &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid an infinite loop &lt;strong&gt;after setting the CSS rule&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#06-%F0%9F%97%B3use-partial-to-split-your-styles-into-smaller-chunks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  06. 🗳Use _Partial to Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore, i.e: _partial. scss . The underscore lets Sass know that the specific file is partial and will not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are meant to be used with the @import directive. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to it organized.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if all your text color is saved in a separate sass file called "&lt;strong&gt;_textColor.scss&lt;/strong&gt;", and you want them in the &lt;strong&gt;main.scss&lt;/strong&gt; module, this is how to use them in the main Sass file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'textColor'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that you don't need to specify the underscore and file extension in the import statement. Because Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all text color, mixins, and other bunch of code are available to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#07-extends-one-set-of-css-styles-to-another-element"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  07. 💱Extends One Set of CSS Styles to Another Element
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@extend is a feature of Sass that allows classes to share a set of properties with one another.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the below block of CSS rules style .card class. it has some properties like background color, width, height.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;200px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;150px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you want another card called &lt;strong&gt;".popup-card&lt;/strong&gt;". It has the same properties just like the base &lt;strong&gt;".card"&lt;/strong&gt; class. But we need additional property in the &lt;strong&gt;popup card&lt;/strong&gt;. It is possible to &lt;em&gt;copy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;paste&lt;/em&gt; from the base card to the target class. But there is a much better way to do it with the &lt;strong&gt;@extend&lt;/strong&gt; directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a look:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sass"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.popup-card&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;@extend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.card&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#349db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;overwrite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; styles in the &lt;strong&gt;base&lt;/strong&gt; class to the &lt;strong&gt;target&lt;/strong&gt; class by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reassigning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the values. Otherwise, we will have the same properties as base &lt;strong&gt;".card"&lt;/strong&gt; as well as our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;additional styles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
