      <title>Virtual Visits: How to enable Remote Doctor Appointment App Development</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today's virtual world, people are becoming more and more accustomed to experiencing things virtually. In the era of artificial intelligence and AI, how can healthcare be far behind?&lt;br&gt;
Virtual healthcare, which uses technology to create virtual interactions between patients and doctors, has gained a lot of traction in recent years. It is helping patients connect to doctors from the comfort of their homes without physically visiting them while offering them a healthcare experience as close to real as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthcare apps have been on the rise. According to Statista, the global healthcare app market is expected to reach $582 billion by 2023, and healthcare apps will be downloaded close to 2 billion times by 2022. These apps allow patients to book appointments, consult with doctors, get prescriptions, and even order medicines. The rise of virtual healthcare has drastically changed how the healthcare industry operates. It is helping patients connect with doctors from the comfort of their homes without physically visiting them while offering them a healthcare experience as close to real as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Doctor Appointment App Development:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor's appointment booking app is helpful as it saves you from the hassle of having to visit a doctor's office, parking your car, waiting in a queue, and paying hefty charges. All you need to do is download the app, fill in your details, and select the day, time and doctor. All you have to pay is nominal charges. The best thing about the app is that you can choose from different types of doctors – regular, pediatric, emergency, and specialist. Moreover, you can pick the doctor at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual healthcare, which uses technology to create virtual interactions between patients and doctors, has gained a lot of traction in recent years. It is helping patients connect to doctors from the comfort of their homes without physically visiting them while offering them a healthcare experience as close to real as it gets. Healthcare apps have been on the rise. These apps allow patients to book appointments, consult with doctors, get prescriptions, and even order medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Telemedicine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual medical care, telemedicine, e-medicine, and telehealth are terms referring to electronic health care technology. In general, the term telehealth refers to telecommunications technologies to deliver health care services at a distance via interactive audio and video transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telemedicine uses telecommunications technologies to deliver health care services at a distance via interactive audio and video transmissions. Telemedicine combines traditional health care practices with telecommunications technologies. Health care providers transmit health and medical data through the telephone, radio, Internet, or satellite connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual care is the delivery of health care services via electronic means. Virtual care refers to the delivery of health care through telecommunications technologies but does not include delivering health care services via interactive audio and video transmissions. Virtual care may include online checkups, online consultations, online prescriptions, online physician visits, virtual clinics, online health advice, and so on. Doctors and patients also communicate with each other through emails, text messages, online chats, video conferences, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telehealth improves access to health care services and reduces the geographic barriers that limit individual health care. Telehealth not only increases the number of health care providers but also improves the health care quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telehealth education can improve the health and well-being of people around the world. Some telehealth education programs include online tutorials, online training, online lectures, distance learning, online seminars, online classes, etc. Telehealth education is the future of medical education.&lt;br&gt;
Telehealth also helps in distance learning. Distance learning is the traditional method of teaching in which the teacher is teaching students who are not physically present in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Are Virtual Visits the Need of the Hour?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the COVID 19 outbreak, however, many medical practitioners have set up virtual clinics where patients can see a doctor over the Internet. That approach may make sense for common problems like colds or the flu, where the doctor can usually tell the patient what to do and send them home. But the virtual clinic approach is inappropriate for more serious conditions like heart disease, cancer, or stroke. In those cases, the doctor has to be sure of the diagnosis, and the most common way of doing that is by seeing the patient face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual clinics are still useful in some situations. When you have an extremely rare disease, for example, a virtual clinic may be the only way you can find a doctor who treats it. But for most conditions, going online is unlikely to provide enough additional information to allow the doctor to diagnose and prescribe the proper treatment. When a patient is admitted to a hospital, his doctor arrives and takes him for a physical. The doctor examines him, takes his pulse, listens to his heart, and then prescribes treatment. The patient encounters a nurse who takes his temperature, listens to his breathing, and swabbing his nose on the way out. The patient then goes to a pharmacy, where a technician, who usually is not a doctor, takes his blood pressure. After processing, the patient gets a prescription for medicine and leaves. Moreover, the patient's medical records are reviewed by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that telemedicine is gradually replacing face-to-face consultations. The doctors will ask questions to their patients on their Smartphone. The doctor will prescribe medicine, and the patient will get the medicine delivered to his home. The doctor's staff can do this review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients Get Special Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most doctors are convinced that they have two patients: the ones they see and the ones they don't. They spend almost all of their time with the one they see; the other waits impatiently on the front porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doctors' waiting rooms are too small. Half the time, the patients sitting on the couch don't even look at the doctor. Meanwhile, the patients have a lot to tell them. Instead of being intimidated and intimidated, they'd rather talk to their doctor. Doctors who learn how to listen can cure more diseases. The problem is that doctors don't know how to listen. If you want to learn how to listen, it helps to know what to listen for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idea2app.dev/medicine-delivery-app-development.html"&gt;Appointment App Development&lt;/a&gt;:-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that it makes no difference: video appointments are still appointments, so the patient can reschedule or cancel them or just not show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suppose the patient has trouble cancelling. Suppose the patient has trouble showing up. Suppose the patient has trouble understanding what the doctor is saying. Suppose the patient has trouble getting an appointment. When a medical consultation becomes dependent on technology, the patient loses control. Without control, the patient loses information. Without information, the patient loses power. Even the best system will be less good for the patient than a real appointment, which is already better than no appointment. It's the difference between a doctor making a recommendation and a patient weighing the pros and cons of treatment. Virtual medical consultations reduce the doctor-patient relationship to a transactional one: the doctor reviews the information you have provided and recommends the best treatment for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consultants have a website, and, if you are lucky, you'll find reviews left by other people. But these are not reliable: ordinary customers do not have much to say about the consultants they consult, and consultants are not always eager to advertise their failings. So, for example, if you look up "Dr. Bernard" on Psychology Today, you get 133 pages of notes about his prescriptions but no mention of his rudeness. A better place to look for reviews is Yelp. There are almost 120 reviews of Dr Bernard, and they are all quite bad. The doctor is rude, practices medicine without qualifications, swears, and is worst of all, he is French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Yelp's reviews are neither reliable nor complete. Because Yelp is a website, it only asks its users to review doctors they have worked with. This is helpful because if every user left a review for every doctor they had ever visited, Yelp would become unusable. But it is quite misleading: if a user is unhappy, they may never contact the doctor again, and Yelp never gets to hear about that. Worse, reviewers on Yelp can lie. Yelp cannot tell if a review is genuine or even whether two different reviewers are the same person. Reviews can be even more misleading than they seem. For example, Yelp has a button that allows reviewers to report fake reviews, but it does not tell whether the report is genuine. So a reviewer can report a fake review, and Yelp can punish the faker, but Yelp can never tell whether the faker was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idea2app.dev/medicine-delivery-app-development.html"&gt;Doctor appointment app development&lt;/a&gt;:- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A doctor's app, which patients and doctors own, is gaining traction. It's a disruptive technology. But in terms of revenue, it's still a small market.  The health care industry, which accounts for 17 per cent of the U.S. economy, generated $3.9 trillion in 2015. And of that, $1.6 trillion was spent on pharmaceuticals. The app lets patients and providers instantly set up video consultations or transfer video from Skype, Google Hangouts or Face time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any allergies or would like to seek medical advice on a general matter? Are you afraid of going out during Corona virus season? There is no need to be concerned because telemedicine platforms will keep you covered and remotely provide doctor coverage for all illnesses. All you have to do is schedule an appointment with a doctor and show up at the scheduled time. This way, you can live a healthy life and avoid becoming exposed to any virus infections that are circulating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>13 Reasons Why You Should Use Linux!!</title>
      <author>Tanmay Vaish</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:01:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tanmayvaish/13-reasons-why-you-should-use-linux-3p6i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tanmayvaish/13-reasons-why-you-should-use-linux-3p6i</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People usually think: "If it so easy to run Windows, Why should I use Linux". Honestly writing, they are pretty much right about it too. There are lots and lots of features which Linux will always have a hard time providing to its users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to reliability and solidity, Everyone knows that Linux is the one-stop solution, let it be &lt;strong&gt;servers running the internet or for storage of our cloud data&lt;/strong&gt;. Even, Microsoft uses Linux to run &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/"&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; (Yeah, It does!!😱). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its open source nature also plays a vital part on its awesomeness🌟. Think, if all the &lt;strong&gt;greatest mind in this whole world participate to create a product&lt;/strong&gt;, Will anything else could compete to that? The answer is straight away NO. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's what Linux is...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specific hardware requirement or anything. Just download it and use and customize it however you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I am going to list down &lt;strong&gt;13 points&lt;/strong&gt; which leave you &lt;strong&gt;mesmerized&lt;/strong&gt;, making you eager to switch your Operating System right now!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-free-and-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Free and Open Source 😋
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Fo3s2Ka--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633923806557/gcCPFVeWn.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Fo3s2Ka--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633923806557/gcCPFVeWn.jpeg" alt="free.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; does not cost you a penny (&lt;em&gt;other than your data charges during its installation&lt;/em&gt; ✨). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about Windows, it will roughly cost you from around $140 to $200 at best buy. While for MacOS, You have exclusively buy a iMac or Macbook which are &lt;strong&gt;not cheap&lt;/strong&gt; (I must add). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Linux, after the download, it is &lt;strong&gt;ALL YOURS&lt;/strong&gt;. No more hidden charges, add-on packs or anything. Interestingly, with its &lt;strong&gt;open source nature&lt;/strong&gt;, you can view the source code 😱, giving you the freedom to add, remove or modify whatever features you want (&lt;em&gt;according to your technical skills&lt;/em&gt; 🤓). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many Companies and Programmers &lt;strong&gt;create their versions of Linux&lt;/strong&gt; to get the best benefits for their work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-easy-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Easy to Use 🥮
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3l6qKs3L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633922905715/IBnXPXSwy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3l6qKs3L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633922905715/IBnXPXSwy.png" alt="applications.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Is this guys gone mad!!" - you must be thinking, but &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust me&lt;/strong&gt;, It is &lt;strong&gt;very easy to use and comprehend&lt;/strong&gt;. Its just that, people tend to get swayed by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution"&gt;distros&lt;/a&gt; currently trending, which are generally hard to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating Systems like &lt;a href="https://archlinux.org/"&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gentoo.org/"&gt;Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; are such distros which are not only &lt;strong&gt;hard to use&lt;/strong&gt; but also &lt;strong&gt;hard to install&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with &lt;strong&gt;less complicated&lt;/strong&gt; distros like &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://getsol.us/home/"&gt;Solus&lt;/a&gt; etc. They provide easy &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"&gt;GUI&lt;/a&gt; (Graphical User Interfaces) for installation and Software management. Moreover, use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager"&gt;Window Managers&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment"&gt;Desktop Environment&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://forty.gnome.org/"&gt;Gnome 40&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/"&gt;Budgie&lt;/a&gt;, they provide great GUIs for your Linux which makes your overall experience very easy and efficient🥳. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after sometime on Linux, you will start to admire &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt;(Command Line Interface). Why? 'cause it just makes your work very fast. &lt;code&gt;Type one command&lt;/code&gt; and its done🤩. Isn't it cool🔥?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-multiplicity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Multiplicity 👏
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bjdtiMsx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926533303/BJTEJ868d.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bjdtiMsx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926533303/BJTEJ868d.jpeg" alt="multiple.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://devrant.com/rants/59847/what-linux-distro-are-you-using"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of the term &lt;code&gt;Distro-Hopping&lt;/code&gt;⁉️? It is actually a activity or hobby of enthusiastic Linux users where they frequently switch between different distros. Can you Imagine? There are so many distros, that it has become a sport to switch between🤩. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never getting bored again!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no end to the versions and variety of Linux. There is a particular Linux for every possible task, specializing in providing configuration, packages and customization to ease your work of setting up again and again🤩. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let it be Programming, Hacking , DevOps or if you have a low-end desktop, Linux have got you covered. You can even make one for your own and publish it for anyone from your field to use. &lt;em&gt;Isn't it amazing?&lt;/em&gt;🔥. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-cyber-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Cyber Security 🕵️‍♂️
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e5FJyNHZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633920357162/g-XIHEiN1.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e5FJyNHZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633920357162/g-XIHEiN1.webp" alt="hackerman.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way in heaven 🌌, that you can start your journey to become a cyber security expert/hacker without knowing 'L' of "Linux". The security and transparency of Linux provides just makes it ideal for the hacking purposes😯. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good hacker knows their operating system perfectly, and even more importantly, the operating system they will be attacking. Linux allows the user to see and manipulate all of its components, thus the reason for its popularity🔥 among the cyber security experts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux Distros like &lt;a href="https://www.kali.org/"&gt;Kali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.parrotsec.org/"&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt; etc. provide great deal of pre-configured software system and scripts needed to practice or perform a hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-cloud-and-web-servers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Cloud and Web Servers ☁️
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qjRbD0wE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925938605/s_-UFUcPI.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qjRbD0wE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925938605/s_-UFUcPI.jpeg" alt="server.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server"&gt;Web Servers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt; platforms out there are running on Linux💡. With its reliability, organizations can deliver apps, content, and services to their customers &lt;strong&gt;at a low cost but at the same time provide performance, stability, security and it is scalable&lt;/strong&gt;🙀. And don't forget what I previously mentioned, Even Microsoft uses it for its Azure cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 96.3% of the world’s top million servers run on Linux (cloud providers, web hosting, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/microsoft-using-linux-run-cloud/"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2015/09/microsoft-using-linux-run-cloud/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Linux &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;offers interface&lt;/strong&gt; that let you make decisions, execute commands repeatedly, create new utilities and tools, and automate server administration tasks💡. Basically, giving you &lt;strong&gt;absolute command over your server&lt;/strong&gt;🔥.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-devops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. DevOps
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DpBmUnyW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925117402/itSHdzN8a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DpBmUnyW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633925117402/itSHdzN8a.png" alt="devsops.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                                    The DevOps workflow. Source: Pease, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*To understand the role of Linux in DevOps, we first have to understand what is Devops!&lt;/em&gt;🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-devops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is DevOps?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps"&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt; methodology is an approach that unifies software development with IT operations. The plan emphasizes fast software delivery through automation, integration, close collaboration, and open communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that we know, lets talk about how Linux and DevOps go hand in hand🤝.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability ✔️&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the key🔑 to DevOps Flow-cycle, Thanks to Linux, you can store and compute any number of processes, and also can run it on anything and anywhere 🔥.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Delivery Pipelines ✔️&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery"&gt;software delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;deployed on Linux servers&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, It becomes very easy to &lt;strong&gt;run tests&lt;/strong&gt; on your system before deploying it to the servers🔥.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*There are many more example but I am going to omit them as those points are pretty much repetitive of what I said before in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-customizable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Customizable 👨‍🔧
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w3UP0FRN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926288258/maEiPn4IA.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w3UP0FRN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633926288258/maEiPn4IA.jpeg" alt="custom.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sarveshspatil111/i3wm-nord"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the necessary &lt;strong&gt;Imagination and Technical skills🤓&lt;/strong&gt;, you can customize your Linux OS to its fullest capabilities both in a visual and configuration-wise manner😮. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some ways you can customize your Linux: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitching with its Desktop Utilities like File Manager, Window Manager etc.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing new Desktop Themes.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Better Shells for your &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt; like fish.✔️&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exploring new Package Managers.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing Scripts to automate your work.✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several tools which helps you customize you system for you.

&lt;p&gt;Due to its reliability and awesomeness, Linux, over the years, has accumulated popularity🔥 among a vast amount of people. The passion and curiosity led them to create many communities, forums, subreddits etc.💡 which are really welcoming and helpful to new comers. You can ask any questions there⁉️, Like having trouble to install anything or issue setting up your new Window Manager, the community will respond to it very fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, There are not few in numbers either, there is at least one dedicated community for every Linux OS out there🤩. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you believe? You are getting super awesome support system without even spending a penny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Once familiar with Linux, you can also contribute in these communities by resolving other user's queries posted over at the forums.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/t/linux/l0RGEic"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is a Open Source software with no proprietor of any sort💡, which gives you the freedom to &lt;strong&gt;own your OS&lt;/strong&gt;, using it however you want with no questions asked🔥. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, you will be having &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt; access from the start💡! It just &lt;code&gt;gives you more privacy&lt;/code&gt;🔐 as nobody is there to keep check what you are doing with your PC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can exclusively create Users and set what permissions you want to give it to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux's &lt;strong&gt;Superior User Privilege Model&lt;/strong&gt; and  &lt;strong&gt;Built-in Kernel Defense System&lt;/strong&gt; just  makes it less vulnerable to any viruses or malware, than any proprietor OS like Windows and Mac💡. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run any command or file which can change system configuration, you have to be logged in as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;💡. Malicious programs and viruses require root privileges to make any change or damage to the Linux system, which they don't get, rendering them invalid🤭.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux also saves your precious money which you would have spent on the purchase of expensive anti-virus software to keep your system virus-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, due to it being open source, &lt;strong&gt;all the source code gets reviewed and any vulnerabilities if found gets patched immediately&lt;/strong&gt;💡.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Linux can run on just about anything!! From a super small raspberry pi to a huge super computer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Linux's customization flexibility🌟, it can easily condensed down into small OS package which can cater the need of Low-End Systems. In fact, Linux Community is very famous for its miracles in the revival of outdated yet working hardware systems✨.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just started college and possibly don't have the budget to buy a high-end laptop. You can consider buying a Low-End one and installing Linux to get the same user experience at a lesser price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusively, If you do not have a High-End PC configuration, and you still want a wonderful experience. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux will be the best choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;🔥. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-less-bloatware"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  12. Less Bloatware 🤏
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UVpKkEiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633962949489/BZhyIH4_w.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UVpKkEiZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633962949489/BZhyIH4_w.jpeg" alt="bloat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real pain😢 I faced as a Windows user was having lots of application and programs that you do not require at that time or would never require it (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat"&gt;bloat&lt;/a&gt;), but they are still there, eating all you hard disk space and processing power. It just became really annoying😒! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would I want to play Candy Crush Saga in my PC? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do anybody want to watch advertisement in their own PC (Start Menu Ads)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More so, removing them just becomes a tedious task😩, as there are so many you have to uninstall or disable each and every one of them manually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, Linux comes with just the &lt;strong&gt;adequate and necessary applications and programs required&lt;/strong&gt;🔥. Moreover, you can also get your required version (&lt;em&gt;with only required applications and programs&lt;/em&gt;) of setup too, which means, if you are a hacker, you can install distros like Kali, which provide exactly the right applications and programs for you✨. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-software-packages-and-updates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  13. Software Packages and Updates 🧑‍💻
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGANhmXS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634611150639/GbmtfxWpn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cGANhmXS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634611150639/GbmtfxWpn.png" alt="Screenshot from 2021-10-19 08-08-41.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is packed with hundreds of packages from a variety of repositories✨. You can install them from &lt;strong&gt;Software Center&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;which comes with nearly every distro&lt;/em&gt;) or use package managers. Just type&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S _SOFTWARE_NAME_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 and you are good to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Package manager will also vary from distro to distro! Like, pacman for arch, eopkg for solus etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to other proprietary operating systems that force you to install updates (&lt;em&gt;sometimes full of bugs&lt;/em&gt;), Linux gives you &lt;strong&gt;full control&lt;/strong&gt; over how to install and update software🔥. Interestingly, Linux uses something called &lt;strong&gt;"Live Kernel"&lt;/strong&gt; which lets us install any update without need of reboot the system 😱.(&lt;em&gt;Again, Except the Exceptions&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-you-think"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do you think??
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know down in the comment,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think about Linux as a personalized OS?✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which OS do you use? Why?✔️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; Its not like that I hate Windows or any other OS, its just that I have slight preference for Linux over any other OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Let's Read – Eloquent Ruby – Ch 5</title>
      <author>Brandon Weaver</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 09:29:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/baweaver/lets-read-eloquent-ruby-ch-5-28k8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/baweaver/lets-read-eloquent-ruby-ch-5-28k8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my personal favorite recommendation for learning to program Ruby like a Rubyist, &lt;a href="http://eloquentruby.com/"&gt;Eloquent Ruby&lt;/a&gt; is a book I recommend frequently to this day. That said, it was released in 2011 and things have changed a bit since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series will focus on reading over Eloquent Ruby, noting things that may have changed or been updated since 2011 (around Ruby 1.9.2) to today (2021 — Ruby 3.0.x).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an updated version of a previous unfinished Medium series of mine you can &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@baweaver/lets-read-eloquent-ruby-ch-1-b2115d1416a6"&gt;find here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#chapter-5-find-the-right-string-with-regular-expressions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Chapter 5. Find the Right String with Regular Expressions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses on Regular Expressions, or Regex for short. It's one of the most powerful concepts in programming around text manipulation, but also probably one of the most confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already heard of these two I would highly suggest using them while exploring Regex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://rubular.com/"&gt;Rubular&lt;/a&gt; - Basic Ruby-centric Regex tester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://regexr.com/"&gt;Regexr&lt;/a&gt; - More advanced, explains each segment of a Regex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I tend to use Rubular more, but mostly because the extra info Regexr presents is a bit too noisy for me. In either case I would highly suggest running examples from this chapter and experimenting with them in either tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, let's get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introductory-examples"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introductory Examples
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter opens with a few examples, like to start with why do you want Regex? The book uses the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;"09:24 AM"&lt;/code&gt; as an example. How can you tell it's a time? AM or PM? 24H or 12H? Maybe even ambiguous. These are a lot of questions that can be a bit difficult to answer with just &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; methods, requiring something a bit more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Regex like a method of describing the shape of text. &lt;code&gt;"09:24 AM"&lt;/code&gt; is composed of two digits, a colon, two digits, a space, and AM or PM. Regex is a language that lets us say exactly that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Regex starts and ends with a `/`, or surrounded by %r{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;time_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\d{2}:\d{2} (AM|PM)/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# time_match = %r{\d{2}:\d{2} (AM|PM)}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;time_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"09:24 AM"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that's all a bit dense to start out with, so let's step back along with the book to get into a few more examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#matching-one-character-at-a-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Matching One Character at a Time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book lists a few examples, but let's turn those into code real quick:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression x will match x.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/x/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"x"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression aaa will match three a’s all in a row.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/aaa/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aaa"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression 123 will match the first three numbers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/123/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"123"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression R2D2 will match the name of a certain sci-fi robot.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/R2D2/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"R2D2"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/R2D2/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"r2d2"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; false (case sensitive)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#special-characters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Special Characters
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now those could all have been &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; compares instead, so let's look at a few more interesting characters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; - Matches any one character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; - Matches zero or more of whatever comes before it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; - Matches one or more of whatever comes before it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression . will match any single-character&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# string including r and % and ~.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dot_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/./&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"r"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"%"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"~"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In the same way, two periods ( .. ) will match any two characters,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# perhaps xx or 4F or even [!, but won’t match Q since it’s one,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# not two, characters long.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;double_dot_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/../&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;double_dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"xx"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;double_dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"4F"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;double_dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"[!"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;double_dot_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Q"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; false (one character)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#literal-characters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Literal Characters
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some characters you want to match an actual dot, so how does one get Regex to do that? With a backslash:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# \. will match a literal dot.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 3\.14 will match the string version of PI to two decimal places,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# complete with the decimal point: 3.14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/3\.14/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"3.14"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Mr\. Olsen will match exactly one thing: Mr. Olsen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Mr\. Olsen/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. Olsen"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#combining-effects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Combining Effects
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book then goes into a few combos, let's turn those into examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression A. will match any two-character string that&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# starts with a capital A, including AM, An, At, and even A=.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_dot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/A./&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AM"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"An"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"At"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;a_dot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"A="&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Similarly, ...X will match any four-character string that ends&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# with an X, including UVWX and XOOX.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/...X/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"UVWX"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;x_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"XOOX"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression .r\. Smith will match both Dr. Smith as&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# well as Mr. Smith but not Mrs. Smith.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;smith_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/.r\. Smith/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;smith_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Dr. Smith"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;smith_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mr. Smith"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;smith_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Mrs. Smith"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sets-ranges-and-alternatives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sets, Ranges, and Alternatives
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you wanted a character out of a set of them, Regex enables this with &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vowel_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[aeiou]/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;digit_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[0123456789]/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;hex_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[0123456789abdef]/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think of them as inclusion in a set of characters. The book then goes on into a few more examples here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The regular expression [Rr]uss [Oo]lsen will match my name, with or without&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# leading capitals.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[Rr]uss [Oo]lsen/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Russ Olsen"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# More practically, you could use [0123456789abcdef][0123456789abcdef] to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pick out a two-digit hexadecimal number like 3e or ff.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;two_digit_hex_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[0123456789abcdef][0123456789abcdef]/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;two_digit_hex_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"3e"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;two_digit_hex_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ff"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# You can also use [aApP][mM] to match am or PM and anything in between,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# like aM or Pm.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;meridiem_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[aApP][mM]/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;meridiem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"am"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;meridiem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AM"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;meridiem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aM"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;meridiem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"pm"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;meridiem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"pM"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ranges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ranges
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if that all seems a bit tedious there's the concept of a range in Regex:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[a-z]/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"x"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[0-9]/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-set-shortcuts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common Set Shortcuts
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and the even more useful common set shortcuts:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Any number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\d/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Any letter, number, or underscore&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\w/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"c"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Any whitespace like space, tab, and newline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\s/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;" "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#alternatives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Alternatives
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last in this section is the alternative, which you can think more of as "OR":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# A|B will match either A or B.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/A|B/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"A"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/A|B/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"B"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# AM|PM will match either AM or PM.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AM|PM/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AM"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AM|PM/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"PM"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Batman|Spiderman will match the name of one of the two superheros.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Batman|Spiderman/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Batman"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Batman|Spiderman/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Spiderman"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The book goes on to mention that you can use as many alternatives as you would like, but also sneaks in group captures (&lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;) here which I don't believe it gets into later, but trust me when I say that's one of the most useful parts of Regex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-regular-expression-star"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Regular Expression Star
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly we mentioned this above in special characters, the star (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) stands for zero or more of whatever is before it, and the plus (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;) stands for one or more. There's one more idea here with specifying count, but that's an item for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentions the following examples:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# AB* will match AB—that’s an A followed by one B.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AB*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"AB"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# AB* will also match ABB as well as ABBBBBBBB—remember, it’s an A followed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# by any number of B’s.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AB*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ABB"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AB*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ABBBBBBBB"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Don’t forget that AB* will also match plain old A—any number of B’s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# includes no B’s at all.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AB*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"A"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we were to switch to &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that last case wouldn't work. The book then goes on to mention that sets, ranges, and common sets work with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; as well. Really, anything does:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Zero or more vowels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[aeiou]*/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Zero or more numbers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[0–9]*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\d*/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Zero or more hex digits, lowercase&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/[0-9a-f]*/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Zero or more of any character&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/.*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That last one the book mentions can be extremely useful, and is frequently used to make more flexible patterns:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/George.*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"George Smith"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/.*George/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Sally George"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/.*George.*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Jimmy George Joeseph"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personally I would advocate for being more explicit about what you expect, lest you match more than you intended. Perhaps you do want to match a lot more, that's fine too, but make sure that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regular-expression-counts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regular Expression Counts
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book does not mention this, but it's an important subject to bring up: counts. Star is used for zero or more, plus for one or more, question for optional, but what about if I wanted something like 4 to 5 instances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four count matches you'll want to be aware of:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Exactly 3 of a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a{3}/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aaa"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 3 or more of a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a{3,}/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aaaa"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Between 3 and 6 of a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a{3,6}/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aaaaa"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Up to 6 of a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/a{,6}/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"aaaaa"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do note though that unless used in conjunction with the section "Beginnings and Ends" coming up it won't work as intended, so be sure to give that a look and see if you can spot the flaws in the above matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regular-expressions-in-ruby"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regular Expressions in Ruby
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point the book is just mentioning the Regex language without really getting into the Ruby implementation. For me and this article, however, I used Ruby implementations to show how it would work, so a lot of this will seem familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give an overview instead of what it mentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#equal-squiggly-raw-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Equal Squiggly (&lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equal squiggly sign is used for matching in Ruby, though it's not the clearest syntax:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\d\d:\d\d (AM|PM)/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'10:24 PM'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why zero? That's the position in the string it found the match at. If there was nothing in there we'd get &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; back instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I prefer &lt;code&gt;match?&lt;/code&gt; as it returns back an explicit true or false, is faster, and very rarely do I need to know the direct index of something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#regex-flags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Regex Flags
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book does sneak a fast one in here with Regex flags like &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; which makes things case-insensitive:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;merediem_match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/AM|PM/i&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;merediem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"am"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;merediem_match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"pm"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several more you can find at the bottom of rubular, but the common ones I use are &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; for case-insensitive and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; for whitespace-insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#methods-taking-regex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Methods Taking Regex
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also methods like &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gsub&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scan&lt;/code&gt;, and others which take in a Regex, like this example the book provides:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Document&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;obscure_times!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;gsub!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\d\d:\d\d (AM|PM)/i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"**:** **"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I did add the &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; there, where the book omits it. Case-insensitive would be more flexible here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#beginnings-and-ends"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Beginnings and Ends
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book then mentions that the Regex we've used so far are unbounded, meaning they match anywhere in a string. There are a few more special expressions that allow us to specify beginning and end of line, and beginning and end of strings:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Matches beginning of String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\ASome text/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Some text starts this"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Matches end of String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Some text\z/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ends with Some text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Matches beginning of any line in a string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/^Some text/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Other text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Some text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Matches end of any line in a String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/Some text$/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;match?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Some text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Other text"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Especially when dealing with user input you want to be exceptionally strict about this, and most Rails security tools are going to give you grief over omitting explicit beginning and ending of String signifiers in your Regex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-the-wild"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In the Wild
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentions a real-world usecase as timezone offsets in &lt;code&gt;time.rb&lt;/code&gt;, notedly numeric ones like &lt;code&gt;-07:00&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;+08:00&lt;/code&gt;, with this line:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/\A([+-])(\d\d):?(\d\d)\z/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;zone&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The book mentions question mark (&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;) as being an optional character, meaning there could be a colon there, or there could not be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the interesting part, and what the book wants to highlight, is that if the Regex isn't matched it's compared against a set of values like &lt;code&gt;UTC&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;elsif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;ZoneOffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;include?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;...which mixes the usefulness of Regex with the usefulness of set inclusion. That said, one could also do this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zome_offset_matches&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Regexp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ZoneOffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;...which I've gotten a good deal of mileage out of in the past&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#staying-out-of-trouble"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Staying Out of Trouble
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentions watching out for using &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; accidentally in place of &lt;code&gt;=~&lt;/code&gt;, though to avoid that I would still actively recommend using &lt;code&gt;match?&lt;/code&gt; instead as clear naming means a lot when reading your code later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second it mentions is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; being falsy in C-like languages, despite being truthy in Ruby and representing something was found at the 0th index of a String.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a ton to cover any time Regex comes up, and the book gives a solid start, though I do really wish they had spent a bit of time on capture groups and counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may do a writeup or addendum to this chapter later on capture groups if there's interest, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up we'll have Symbols, one of the more confusing aspects of Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is New in .NET 6.0 Preview?</title>
      <author>Tarun Gurang</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 09:26:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tarungurang/what-is-new-in-net-60-preview-1mca</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tarungurang/what-is-new-in-net-60-preview-1mca</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are pleased to provide you with the first look of .NET 6 and tell you what to expect from the new release. We have defined the general form of the version over the last several months, including a large set of new experiences and capabilities. The core of .NET 6 is to deliver the last portions of the .NET unification plan that began with .NET 5. This release will also include significant improvements in all parts of .NET, including cloud, desktop, and mobile applications. It will take several overviews to make the biggest reach of the version fully available in .NET 6 builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See ASP.NET Core and EF Core publications for details of what is new for web and data access scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET 6 has been tested with Visual Studio 16.9 Preview 4 as well as Visual Studio for Mac 8.9. We recommend you use these builds if you want to try. NET 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sections are divided into two parts: an initial look into what we deliver for .NET 6 in general (what you will receive in November), and what is new in Preview in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unified-and-extended"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unified and Extended
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET 6 will allow you to create the apps you want to create, for which platforms you want to target, and which operating systems you want to use for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We extend what you can do with .NET and where you can do it by providing the remaining .NET unification vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We integrate Android, iOS, and macOS features which are part of Xamarin into .NET 6. We also extend what you can do with Blazor in a new type of hybrid client application a combination of web and native user interface – which can be used for desktop and mobile scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new features will be described below in this post and the following previews. Our unification efforts deliver something for all .NET developers. If you are a desktop application developer, there are new options for you to reach new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a mobile application developer, you can use the mainline .NET tools and APIs, while targeting both iOS and Android platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a web or cloud developer, it will be easier to expose the services to .NET mobile applications and share code with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take advantage of the opportunity surrounding unification to simplify and extend the experience of building Xamarin Forms applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call this project .NET Multi-platform App UI. This project will offer many enhancements and capabilities that will extend the scope of the desktop and mobile developer platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#open-planning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Open Planning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have adopted a more inclusive planning process with .NET 6. We are preparing .NET broadcasts with a hierarchical style of themes, epics, and user stories, with priorities and categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model allows you to see the version at a broader scope, provides an overview of the most important features, and makes it easier to find opportunities to engage and contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/blog/razor-pages-vs-mvc-in-asp-net"&gt;Razor Pages Vs Mvc In Asp.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan you see on GitHub is now an integral component of our engineering process. We will do our best to update these issues and link them to relevant activities and documents to help you better understand the depth and scope of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to get involved, ask questions and provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#platform-supports"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Platform Supports
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.NET 6 to be launched in November 2021, it will be supported for three years, it is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release. The platform matrix has been considerably expanded .NET 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional supports are Android, iOS, Mac and Mac Catalyst, Apple Silicon “M1”, Windows Arm64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fast-inner-loop"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fast Inner Loop
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick iterative development is the trademark of any delightful and productive development platform. We initiated a new project called Fast Inner Loop. The first part of the project makes it possible to make the builds run faster with a set of performance projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen the Xamarin team innovate with the XAML Hot Reload experience in the last few years and began to envision the activation of hot-reloading as a general .NET capability, and not only for XAML, but C#/IL. We are defining a new hot code reload model that we can offer for all types of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#targeting-net-6"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Targeting .NET 6
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TFM target repositories for .NET 6 follow the approach we have adopted with .NET 5. New TFMs have been added following additional support for new platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you target .NET 6, you can use a .NET 6 TFM (target framework monikers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;targetframework&amp;gt;net6.0&amp;lt;/targetframework&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The compatibility relationships for each of these TFMs, both between this set and existing TFMs, are discussed .NET 6.0 Target Frameworks(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect that upgrading from .NET 5 to .NET 6 would be straightforward. Please report any breakage changes you discover while testing existing applications with .NET 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#response-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Response Files
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A response file is a file that holds a set of command-line arguments for a tool. The response files are based on two primary use cases: allows a command-line call to exceed the terminal character limit, and it is convenient to type the same commands over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response file support has been added to the .NET CLI.  The format of the response file is one line of text, just as it would be structured within a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following animation demonstrates the use of an answer file with dotnet build, you can type this command dotnet build @example.rsp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--it7VHQ2W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lsb1bbq8az02q5551snp.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--it7VHQ2W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lsb1bbq8az02q5551snp.jpg" alt="command window in .net"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#libraries"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Libraries
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following APIs have been introduced to the .NET libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Math APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following performance-based mathematics APIs have been added to System.Math. Their implementation will be accelerated if supported by the underlying equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are New APIs which are following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can compute the Sin and Cos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can compute the ReciprocalEstimate for the approximate of 1 / x.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can compute the ReciprocalSqrtEstimate for the approximate of 1 / Sqrt(x).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some new overloads are following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nint and nunit is supported by the Clamp, DivRem, Min, and Max.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nint is also supported by Abs and Sign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DivRem returns a tuple value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for Reliable &lt;a href="https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/dot-net-development-company"&gt;.Net Development Company&lt;/a&gt;? Your Search ends here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improve-support-for-windows-acls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improve Support for Windows ACLs
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System.Threading.AccessControl now includes enhanced support to interact with Windows Access control lists (ACLs). Some New overloads have been added into the OpenExisting and TryOpenExisting methods for EventWaitHandle, Mutex, and Semaphore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;namespace System.Threading{
    public static partial class EventWaitHandleAcl
    {
        public static EventWaitHandle OpenExisting(string Aclname, EventWaitHandleRights Aclrights);
        public static bool TryOpenExisting(string Aclname, EventWaitHandleRights Aclrights, out EventWaitHandle Aclresult);
    }
    public static partial class AclMutex
    {
        public static Mutex OpenExisting(string Mutexname, MutexRights Mutexrights);
        public static bool TryOpenExisting(string Mutexname, MutexRights Mutexrights, out Mutex Mutexresult);
    }
    public static partial class AclSemaphore
    {
        public static Semaphore OpenExisting(string Se_name, SemaphoreRights Se_rights);
        public static bool TryOpenExisting(string Se_name, SemaphoreRights Se_rights, out Semaphore Se_result);
    }}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we have discussed some new features in .NET 6. These features are used by the developers. If the developer performs math operation so .NET 6 provide the new Math APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Class Diagram</title>
      <author>nadirbasalamah</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 09:19:52 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/nadirbasalamah/introduction-to-class-diagram-2831</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many steps when developing a software. One of those steps is software design. In software design step, there are many diagrams that used and one of those is class diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#class-diagram"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Class Diagram
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class diagram is a diagram that represents relation between many entities that involved in a software. The class diagram consist of attribute and behavior. The attribute represented as a field and behavior represented as a method. This is the structure of class diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qbWSm2oM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aitz6pft00w40h5f0d4x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qbWSm2oM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aitz6pft00w40h5f0d4x.png" alt="Class Diagram Structure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the scope notations that can be used in fields or methods inside class diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Scope&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;public&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Field or method is available publicly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;+setName()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;private&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Field or method only available for its own class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;-id: String&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;protected&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Field or method is available for its own class and its sub classes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;#walk()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;package&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Field or method is available in a same package&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;~getData(): Data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the example of class diagram that represents book entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EH7H4wNK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1m6yg621akb2ukkwdcka.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EH7H4wNK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1m6yg621akb2ukkwdcka.png" alt="Book Entity"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the class diagram above, there are three attributes or fields in a book including &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;. These three fields has a private scope. In &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; class there is a one method called &lt;code&gt;getData()&lt;/code&gt; that has a return type is a book data (&lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#relation-in-class-diagram"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Relation in Class Diagram
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many relationship types in class diagram including generalization, association, aggregation and composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generalization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generalization
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relationship is used to define an inheritance mechanism in class diagram. In this example, the generalization relationship is defined between &lt;code&gt;Vehicle&lt;/code&gt; class and &lt;code&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ul_zdaBy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2mv4r992z4yskvjv8vhj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ul_zdaBy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2mv4r992z4yskvjv8vhj.png" alt="Generalization Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#association"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Association
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relationship is used to define a single relationship between classes that involved each other. In this example, the association relationship is used by &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; class and &lt;code&gt;Blog&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iVckhqD_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dhw2vs5fb5n025g7sics.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iVckhqD_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dhw2vs5fb5n025g7sics.png" alt="Association Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aggregation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Aggregation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relationship is used to define a relationship for a class that is a part of the another class. In this example, the aggregation relationship is used by &lt;code&gt;Car&lt;/code&gt; class and &lt;code&gt;Machine&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oWDXcmbI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/456rh1svl7s3f66c56w8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oWDXcmbI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/456rh1svl7s3f66c56w8.png" alt="Aggregation Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#composition"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Composition
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relationship is used to define a relationship between classes that involved each other and cannot be separated. In this example, the composition relationship is used by &lt;code&gt;Course&lt;/code&gt; class and &lt;code&gt;Teacher&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ICHlCpkK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmbfpc6b7w53wuubt3lf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ICHlCpkK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmbfpc6b7w53wuubt3lf.png" alt="Composition Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-class-diagram"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a Class Diagram
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to create a class diagram like &lt;a href="https://app.diagrams.net"&gt;StarUML&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://staruml.io"&gt;Draw.io&lt;/a&gt; and other software tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps to create a class diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define some entities that involved in a software or application. The entity could become concrete entitiy like book, user or abstract entity like course that taken by student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the attributes and behaviors of an entity. Attributes described as a fields in class whilst behaviors described as a methods in class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the scope for the fields and methods. In general, the scope for the fields is private and scoe for the methods is public or protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define the relationships between classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the class diagram that already created to make sure the diagram is created correctly. The diagram must be correct in terms of syntax and semantics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct in terms of syntax means that a diagram is defined with the correct notation or symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correct in terms of semantic means that a diagram is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Notes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class diagram can be used to define the relationship between entities that involved in a software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many relationships that can be used in class diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalization can be used to define inheritance relationship between classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Association can be used to define single relationship between classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregation can be used to define relationship for a class that is a part of the another class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composition can be used to define relationship between classes that involved each other and cannot be separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article is helpful to understand the concept of class diagram. If you have any thoughts or comments you can write in the discussion section below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to fix M1 Mac issue with installing node versions</title>
      <author>Ibrar Hussain</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 09:19:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ibrarturi/how-to-fix-m1-mac-issue-with-installing-node-versions-30ah</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ibrarturi/how-to-fix-m1-mac-issue-with-installing-node-versions-30ah</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working with frontend framework like &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org"&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; then most of the time we are required to work with different node versions depending on the projects we have. To easily manage different versions of node and easily switch between then our go to one is &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you are using M1 Mac and have installed &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm"&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt; then you might have faced an issue where using the command &lt;code&gt;nvm install 14&lt;/code&gt; is failed to install the desired node version (or any other version).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be bit daunting and you can solve this with following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-rosetta"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install Rosetta
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Rosetta 2 from the command line with:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;softwareupdate &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--install-rosetta&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enable-rosetta-for-iterm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Enable Rosetta for iTerm
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;applications&lt;/code&gt; and right-click on iTerm app&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EyNWVJg1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ngmh52x45epi4diyf2hx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EyNWVJg1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ngmh52x45epi4diyf2hx.png" alt="right-click on iTerm app"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the checkbox for &lt;code&gt;Open using Rosetta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tE1XuHUb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tw2p1ufkxhhriqr7339w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tE1XuHUb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tw2p1ufkxhhriqr7339w.png" alt="Check box for  raw `Open using Rosetta` endraw "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, re-open iTerm app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-desired-node-version"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install desired node version
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, you should be able to install any desired version. For example to install node version 14 then we can use the following command:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
