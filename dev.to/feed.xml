  Kodular vs Thunkable | which is better? | All-time-dev
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ee7oI4Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lp83elavoqt9qk54thpm.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ee7oI4Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lp83elavoqt9qk54thpm.jpg" alt="Image description" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will compare Kodular with Thunkable in different aspects and we will also find out about both of them. So, if you are interested and like our post then share our post with your developer friends and you can also &lt;a href="https://all-time-devlopment.blogspot.com"&gt;visit&lt;/a&gt; all-time-dev for more posts like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-kodular-its-features-and-its-history"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Kodular, its features, and its history?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodular is a freemium app builder which is partnered with ArubaClouds which provides servers to run the Kodular main infrastructure and it is owned by Junnovate, LLC. There are more than 850 active users from more than 200+ countries like the USA, Canada, India, Japan, etc, more than 2.3 million app projects are created using Kodular app builder, and more than 2 million daily users use apps created using Kodular. Pavitra G is the co-founder of Kodular and Diego Barreiro Pérez is the CEO of Kodular. It was founded in 2017 and was made with MIT app inventor which is also a very popular app inventor. But Kodular makes app development easier than MIT and there are more features that Kodular provides its users than MIT app inventor like it supports Blockly. If you are wondering that what is Blockly? Then it describes how to do tasks. In simple words, all the components that we use in Kodular is designed using this. Some more features of Kodular are that it is very easy to use and learn, you don't have to learn a language for using Kodular you can create apps by just dragging and dropping and it is not necessary to pay for Kodular you can use almost every feature of Kodular for free only. They also have a very big community as I have mentioned before. So, if you face any problem then you can easily find its solution on Kodular Community and their support is also very good. Now let's also see some of its components that will help you create your app -&lt;br&gt;
Screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Interface. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout. Media. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing and Animation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and more components of Kodular are there. In our next section, we will find out the pricing and pros and cons of Kodular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pricing-of-kodular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pricing of Kodular
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodular Creator is FREE. However, if you include ads in your apps to monetize them, they will take a little commission from your earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Forever (No ads in-app)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this plan, you can use Kodular and create your app with Kodular but you cannot show ads in your app using Admob or any other Ad network you can create unlimited projects, using unlimited features means you can use everything to create your dream app. It is completely free until you want to monetize it and want to make a profit with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;€ %%% &lt;br&gt;
The next plan of their app builder is € %%%. Literally, their next plan's name is € %%%. If anyone from Kodular is viewing my post then I will say to change the name of this plan because it is really hard to pronounce it. In this plan, they will take a little commission from your app earnings. If you want to know how much money they will take from your earnings then they have a personal calculator to measure the commission they will take from your earning. So, if you want to measure it then you can visit their website. Here is the link&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros and Cons of Kodular&lt;br&gt;
Advantages -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source Framework. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazing Widgets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot Reload. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple and Easy Programming Language. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing Community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to use APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They charge commission for launching and monetizing your app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not good for creating unique apps &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-thunkable-its-features-and-its-history"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Thunkable, its features, and its history?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thunkable is also a very popular freemium app builder like Kodular and millions of users are using and creating apps using this app builder. Ayush Saigal is the co-founder and CEO of Thunkable. Thunkable app builder was created in 2015 and it is owned by Thunkable, Inc. Thunkable is a San Francisco-based company. This popular app builder is made in MIT app inventor and as I have mentioned before MIT App Inventor is an app inventor/builder used to create an app for native apps. It is also better than MIT and provides you features than MIT app inventor and makes your development much easier. Thunkable helps create your favorite by simply dragging and dropping, by using their pre-built components like -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they provide less features than Kodular in terms of pricing. But it is easier to use APIs with Thunkable than Kodular which will help you create better apps but you can only create native apps using Thunkable like Kodular and MIT app inventor. They also have an app that you can use for testing your apps from mobile devices easily. However, Kodular also has an app that you can use for creating amazing apps from your mobile devices. They have a very big community means if you face any problems while creating your apps then you can find its solution easily on the Thunkable community or if you are facing any issue on their website or app or you want to ask them anything then their support is also very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pricing-of-thunkable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pricing of Thunkable
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Thunkable you can either pay monthly or annually. They have personal and business plan in both of them there are three categories which are -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free $0 monthly / yearly (Personal Plans)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>College Search Manager using MongoDB</title>
      <author>Kushagra Gupta</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 06:12:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gkushagra/college-search-manager-using-mongodb-23j1</link>

  &lt;a href="#overview-of-my-submission"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview of My Submission
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College search can become cumbersome as the student has to shortlist colleges, figure out application deadlines, tuition, application fee and other details. This app allows students to search for colleges in the United States. It allows them to create an account and star their search results. Once logged in, the student can search for a college and add an entry for that college to track their progress during the application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this web app a student can keep all data related to their college search in one place, and make changes easily. Moreover, they can share the data collected during their college search with other students. This would save students time as they have the necessary data that they would have looked up themselves otherwise. They might need to look for some changes especially in application fee, deadline and tuition as they tend to change every semester. But apart from that, any other information collected by the student could prove helpful to other students. For example, a student is able to get more insight about a program/major/degree by talking to existing students or professor and makes a note of it in his record. Upon sharing, other student would benefit from that and save a lot of time if he/she was also looking for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web app currently has authentication, college search, capability to add a record for application at a college, adding search results to favorites, and sharing data with other registered users. The plan was also to include uploading and storing any relevant documents and adding notes but only the backend part is complete for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of collections were created like applications - to store a record of application to a college created by user, favorites - any search result starred by the user, users - stores authentication data, us_states - public data about US states, us_universities - ~7000 records of colleges in the US.&lt;br&gt;
A few other collections are also created for analytical purposes like resets - to track account credential changes made by user to inform of malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is not deployed on cloud but runs locally. The backend (app-server) requires a .env file which can be requested by contacting me here or via Issue on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Micro front ends, strategy, and blueberry muffins</title>
      <author>Kevin Yank</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 05:22:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cultureamp/micro-front-ends-strategy-and-blueberry-muffins-404e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cultureamp/micro-front-ends-strategy-and-blueberry-muffins-404e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the director of Culture Amp's large-and-growing front end engineering practice, my biggest challenge in the past year was to communicate a coherent strategy that those 60+ engineers could understand and get behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution was &lt;strong&gt;blueberry muffins&lt;/strong&gt;. 🫐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-the-table"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set the table
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked at &lt;a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/"&gt;Culture Amp&lt;/a&gt; for nearly seven years because I believe that empowering companies to put their people first, to make their culture a competitive advantage, makes a difference in the world that I can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We build a set of web-based products that together we call an employee experience platform. It's a growing collection of React apps to 1) collect employee feedback to drive engagement, 2) run performance reviews that are fair and equitable, and 3) develop the most important workplace skills in managers and individual contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined Culture Amp in 2015 I was employee number 26, we had a single engineering team, and we had yet to land our 200th client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2z-sCIPM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sps6n7pc9e69wc6us4ms.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2z-sCIPM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sps6n7pc9e69wc6us4ms.png" alt="screenshot" width="880" height="1099"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How it started: Culture Amp Insight report circa 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, over 5,000 companies around the world now use our products, which are built and maintained by over 100 engineers across a dozen or so different teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ITDNHQsr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/el8rk5r1zdm5sarmc9sh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ITDNHQsr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/el8rk5r1zdm5sarmc9sh.png" alt="screenshot" width="880" height="1023"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How it's going: the same screen in 2022 – with fake data, of course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe to say, our front end engineers today build a lot of UIs – new and old, routine and novel – all at once. From that comes our biggest challenge. For it to go well (by which I mean we build user interfaces (UIs) affordably, sustainably, and producing a product our customers love) we must empower those engineers to work in separate codebases, but embrace every opportunity we have to &lt;strong&gt;leverage consistency across those codebases&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I say codebases? I meant blueberry muffins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-shopping-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The shopping list
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To articulate a strategy for the practice, I had to start with where we are. For five years and counting, Culture Amp has had a group of engineers devoted to the health and scalability of front end engineering. Here's what they've built so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2017, we began with &lt;a href="https://cultureamp.design"&gt;our design system: Kaizen&lt;/a&gt;. A set of design guidelines, atomic values (design tokens), and more than 50 reusable components (with many more to come!), Kaizen defines the consistent look and feel of our product. There's always more to do, but Kaizen is already in wide and successful use in all our UI code bases today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m0E_jpR8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g4bb1m6ikb3kjsq9unt0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m0E_jpR8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g4bb1m6ikb3kjsq9unt0.png" alt="screenshot of the Kaizen home page" width="880" height="806"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://cultureamp.design/"&gt;The Kaizen website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking off a couple of years later in 2019, Culture Amp's standard development, continuous integration, and serverless infrastructure deployment tooling for UIs is called frontend-ops. It's still an internal project at this stage so I can't link to it, but here's a peek at some of its features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qNTLoBA_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kkglh7wcos1t2sxcdsnu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qNTLoBA_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kkglh7wcos1t2sxcdsnu.png" alt="screenshot listing yarn commands to run a local development server, create a static build, deploy to production, run a Storybook server, and run tools like TypeScript, eslint, Jest, Prettier and Playwright" width="844" height="705"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From the README of Culture Amp's front end app template&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's missing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture Amp has settled on &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; written in &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org"&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; as the standard platform for all of its UIs. But React is just a view framework, which leaves a lot of problems for engineers to solve in building a web app. Routing, data fetching, state management, form validation… there are at least a dozen more things that every Culture Amp UI needs, but which React doesn't provide. Having every team reinvent these wheels for every project is not a good use of their time. In short, we need a more full-featured framework for our React applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are things we need to learn and get better at together as a practice. Not because we're bad at them, but because the art of web application engineering is always progressing, and we need to keep up. Test automation, web accessibility, application security, animation and other user experience refinements, performance optimizations, and driving runtime error rates down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this and more I wrote about in a sweeping vision for the many ways we would improve as a practice in the months and years ahead. It was all in there. Would it provide the clarity my fellow engineers were craving?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Culture Amp's values is to "Learn faster through feedback", so in July 2021 or so I shared my latest draft with a handful of front end engineers and engineering leaders around the company, and asked what they thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a ton of great feedback, much of which I might share in a separate article about writing strategy documents if folks are curious. But my single biggest take-away that crystallized in a conversation with my manager, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridgwaymichael/"&gt;Michael Ridgway&lt;/a&gt; (thanks, Mike!), was that I was missing exactly that: one memorable concept to pull the whole thing together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than a shopping list of necessary ingredients for the success of our practice, &lt;strong&gt;I needed to give readers one idea to remember&lt;/strong&gt;, and carry with them into their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-delicious-metaphor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A delicious metaphor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, a blueberry muffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JSR8D8Sw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oizcse8h59tpuc4fytw.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JSR8D8Sw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9oizcse8h59tpuc4fytw.jpeg" alt='Close-up photo of a blueberry muffin surrounded by others like it. The blueberries are labelled "Kaizen components" and the paper wrapper is labelled "frontend-ops"; both are highlighted in green with the annotation "Leverage these". The cake of the muffin, however, is labelled with three question marks and highlighted in red, with the annotation "Invest in this".' width="880" height="589"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A very delicious muffin, despite appearances!&lt;br&gt;Photo borrowed from &lt;a href="https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/lemon-blueberry-muffins/"&gt;Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting from my final strategy document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our front end apps are blueberry muffins, we want to bake a lot of them while keeping them consistently delicious. To do this, we’ve got a ready-made “muffin cup” we can use on every muffin (frontend-ops), and we’ve locked in a single source for our “blueberries” (Kaizen components). &lt;strong&gt;Next, we need to work on the recipe for our “batter” (our React app architecture/framework).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaizen components are blueberries&lt;/strong&gt; because they're the colourful morsels that festoon the surface of our "muffins". When you decide to bake a blueberry muffin, you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don't have time to plant a blueberry bush and wait for it to grow, so you need a reliable source of high-quality blueberries. Likewise, no one wants to build a date picker from scratch for their new app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontend-ops is the paper cup&lt;/strong&gt; because it's the easily-overlooked conveyance device that speeds the muffin on its journey from oven to mouth. Most &lt;del&gt;UI engineers&lt;/del&gt; bakers couldn't make one from scratch even if they wanted to – it's not even food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The app framework is the batter&lt;/strong&gt; because it's not the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of the muffin – it's the blueberries that make your mouth water, not the cake – but it holds it all together. Without it, you'd just have a pile of blueberries. One bowl of batter makes an entire batch of muffins: you don't make new batter for each muffin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The muffin itself represents the app&lt;/strong&gt; because it's the product we're ultimately trying to offer. No two are exactly alike, but a consistent set of ingredients ensures that every muffin can deliver the same quality despite its uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This single metaphor captures the one most important thing we seek to achieve (make our front end apps more alike, from architecture to pixels), the two aspects that are already going well (UI components and serverless architecture), and the one missing piece that we need everyone to rally to create (a shared application framework).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I published this strategy and presented it at leadership and practice meetings, not to mention numerous engineering inductions since, it's become known as the "blueberry muffin document", and engineers have begun using shorthand like "is this project going to contribute to our 'muffin batter'?" This, more than anything, is the signal that tells me the strategy has landed, and is meaningful to the engineers I wrote it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#crumbs-on-the-floor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Crumbs on the floor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about all the other things that we're also working towards as a practice: test automation and accessibility, performance and error rates? Were they sacrificed in service of a satisfying metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that's the thing about a strategy: it isn't just a list of everything you want. It needs to narrow the focus, elevating a just few things &lt;em&gt;even over&lt;/em&gt; all the other also-desirable things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the overriding priorities covered by the blueberry muffin, the document lists five &lt;a href="https://www.fearlessculture.design/blog-posts/establish-clear-priorities-using-even-over-statements"&gt;"even overs"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow test automation to reduce manual testing burden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve platform accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harden our UIs with new browser security features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polish the details of our user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow performance, shrink errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these it describes the current situation, efforts already being made to progress it, and advice for how engineers passionate about it can contribute to driving it forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a lot done with 60+ engineers, and I'm confident we will progress significantly all five of these areas in the coming year. But none of them is as important as perfecting our blueberry muffin recipe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-muffin-for-the-road"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A muffin for the road
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I saying that you should embrace this same muffin metaphor if you happen to be writing a strategy for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; engineering practice? Not at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you need to pull together a lot of threads into something memorable, do look for that unifying metaphor. Have some fun with it. Got a strong coffee culture in your team? Maybe you're trying to make the perfect macchiato! Like ice cream? Who doesn't!? What might a &lt;a href="https://www.magnumicecream.com/"&gt;Magnum&lt;/a&gt; say about your architecture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably even some non-food-related metaphors to consider; I'm just a little hungry right now. Honestly, I started with chocolate chip cookies until I realised that those aren't baked in a tray of identical cups!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ld8WQch3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iwra1w7wi3f5hv2a5sdw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ld8WQch3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iwra1w7wi3f5hv2a5sdw.png" alt='A Slack conversation between Kevin Yank and Louis Quinnell. Kevin writes "Just realised chocolate chip cookies are baked on a flat sheet, not in cupcake-like tins I was imagining. FML. 😆"' width="589" height="615"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Inf-xvb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zncihr2hdk87l6qjjfik.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6Inf-xvb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zncihr2hdk87l6qjjfik.png" alt='The thread continues, considering images of muffins placed sideways in a baking tray. Louis suggests "I that this represents the need for docs…"' width="589" height="752"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Working out the kinks with Louis Quinnell, the tech lead for frontend-ops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, like so many things, is an opportunity to create culture. Have some fun with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, we think of this kind of thing a lot at Culture Amp. If you like thinking of engineering problems through a lens of company culture, &lt;a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/company/careers"&gt;please apply!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exercises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exercises
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;h3&lt;/em&gt; with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;div&lt;/em&gt; with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another &lt;em&gt;h1&lt;/em&gt; that says “I’m in a div”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; that says “ME TOO!”

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint for this one: after creating the div with createElement, append the &lt;em&gt;h1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to it before adding it to the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NK91_64C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/015gez8uniqboqvxqblw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NK91_64C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/015gez8uniqboqvxqblw.png" alt="Exercise JavaScript" width="880" height="467"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ySF8QfXq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nihnf5bjxlnxqi16e9kz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ySF8QfXq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nihnf5bjxlnxqi16e9kz.png" alt="Exercise Image" width="880" height="378"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#events"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Events
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events are actions that occur on the web page like a mouse click or a key press. With JavaScript, we can listen to the events on the web page and react to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three primary methods are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attach functions’ attributes directly on your HTML elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dOLaPRfU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o5hyzvb9mshzxgds7i4t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dOLaPRfU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o5hyzvb9mshzxgds7i4t.png" alt="method 1" width="759" height="77"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set the “on_event_” property on the DOM object in your JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iokXGmbq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hmhmbcaqlkc63hta5ewq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iokXGmbq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hmhmbcaqlkc63hta5ewq.png" alt="method 2" width="880" height="269"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attach event listeners to the nodes in your JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--97g68Xtq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i90ye9330avjc9ekpres.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--97g68Xtq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i90ye9330avjc9ekpres.png" alt="method 3" width="880" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples taken from The Odin Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Method 3, &lt;em&gt;Attach event listeners to the nodes in your JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;, is the preferred method. It maintains separation of concerns and multiple event listeners can be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;a href="#my-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My experience
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had previously used MongoDB but was unaware of the cool functionalities like Realm functions, triggers etc.&lt;br&gt;
I was really fascinated by how easy it is to build your backend using MongoDB Realm functions. We can easily import npm packages and use those too. I also used triggers for the first time to fetch followers' count everyday and send email report every Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#technologies-used"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Technologies used
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB Realm functions for backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB Realm Triggers to keep track of follower count on schedule and send email on Monday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auth0 for login&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taiwind CSS for styling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next.js as frontend framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#challenges-faced"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Challenges faced
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major challenge was to figure out the way to fetch followers/ subscribers data from various platforms. I had to try many methods (like using official API, scraping etc.) before I arrived at a method that works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-next-for-followstats"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's next for FollowStats?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn and newsletter platforms like Mailchimp, Convertkit, Buttondown etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add charts and graphs to visualize followers' growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#try-it-out"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Try it Out

  Overview of Our Submission
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!&lt;br&gt;
So, we have made an online e commerce store for farmers to directly connect with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no available product in the market that proposes a business logic for the farmer to directly sell to the consumer. We have always felt that technology could help small and big farmers to reach remote corners so that they could grow a product instead of a crop and make their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone
So, we have made an online e commerce store for farmers to directly connect with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no available product in the market that proposes a business logic for the farmer to directly sell to the consumer. We have always felt that technology could help small and big farmers to reach remote corners so that they could grow a product instead of a crop and make their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#our-goal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Our Goal
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KrishiBazaar with its main motto of “Fresh from Farm to Plate” achieves the goal of providing farmers with better opportunities to showcase their produce and pocket a higher remuneration. Its main aim is to do away with the several layers of middlemen between the farmer and the consumer. The project allows farmers to upload details, view product statistics, track various shipments and pickups of orders and receive payment online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-it-does"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What it does
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an absence of an application that connects consumers with farmers in a transparent and direct manner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krishi Bazaar with its main motto of “Fresh from Farm to Plate” achieves the goal of providing farmers with better opportunities to showcase their produce and pocket a higher remuneration. This reduces the cost to end consumer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Krishi Bazaar provides farmers with a safe space to educate themselves and receive the appropriate assistance they require. This project aims to help farmers achieve their true potential without the need to be dependent on intermediaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tech-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tech Stack
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's come to the technology.&lt;br&gt;
For building this application, we have used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/projecthts/MongodbProj"&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;- For building the frontend of the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;NodeJs&lt;/a&gt; - Express - For building backend services and maintaing persistent sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.mongodb.com/"&gt;MongoDb Atlas&lt;/a&gt; - Used as the application database (Have always been a fan of Json based databases. And its cloud!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/"&gt;Atlas Search&lt;/a&gt; - For features like autocomplete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/functions/"&gt;Realm Function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/triggers/trigger-types/"&gt;Triggers&lt;/a&gt; - For generating a timely (daily) report on the market for analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/timeseries-collections/"&gt;TimeSeries Collection&lt;/a&gt; - For storing the daily reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://razorpay.com/"&gt;RazorPay API&lt;/a&gt; - Because we can't make payment gateways yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://fontawesome.com/"&gt;FontAwesome&lt;/a&gt; - Who doesn't want their website to look cool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://particles.js.org/"&gt;Particle JS&lt;/a&gt; - Again who doesn't want a bit of confetti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/"&gt;PassportJs&lt;/a&gt; - For authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; -For Hosting the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay lets dive a bit deeper into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#key-features"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Key Features
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-authentication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Authentication
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have used the Passport JS library that provides various strategies for authentication. Here we have introduced a local strategy that authenticates with email and password. We are also using the express session, passport session and mongo store to maintain persistent sessions. In simpler terms, the backend sets a cookie in the browser on logging in. The backend also stores this cookie in the database along with the associated user. With every request, the browser sends this cookie back to the backend to validate. The backend validates it with the cookie present in the database and hence persists in the session.&lt;br&gt;
A user can sign up as either of the two roles: Farmer (Farmer + Consumer) or Consumer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/7roWZ7wXAZdLlNHdmU/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/7roWZ7wXAZdLlNHdmU/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-setting-up-a-store-register-as-a-farmer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Setting up a store - Register as a farmer&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A farmer can set up their own store. This can be&lt;br&gt;
achieved by setting up an identity on the website by registering as a farmer. The farmer can provide details like email address, phone number, name, farmer verification proof and address and create an identity on the website which can now be identified by any other user of the website.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/kOgcO0yCjkFb5qzZnR/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/kOgcO0yCjkFb5qzZnR/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-adding-products-to-the-market-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Adding products to the market -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a farmer the user can add a product to the market. The details include:&lt;br&gt;
Product image, Name, Description, Categories, Discounts and pricing, pickup address. We have used Firebase Storage to store product image and MongoDB Atlas to store other product related information. Once the product is in the database, it is officially on the market!&lt;br&gt;
These products are visible to a consumer user along with the farmer brand. The consumer can also search and filter through all the products in the market. They can also get suggestions for various products based on their purchases and market analysis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/4JX1WmgVJUubJ8uPSI/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/4JX1WmgVJUubJ8uPSI/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-shipments-and-orders-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Shipments and Orders -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A farmer can view his shipments on the portal. Shipments are the products that consumers have ordered from the farmer. A farmer can track the shipments till they reach the consumer. After an order is delivered, it gets deleted from the farmer's shipments.&lt;br&gt;
The consumer also stays updated with ongoing orders as well as&lt;br&gt;
has a log of all past orders. All the details of each order including the delivery date, are visible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/aflwe41WvZEIERn6qg/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/aflwe41WvZEIERn6qg/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-the-pickup-module-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - The pickup module -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A farmer is also able to view his pickups. Pickups on the portal is nothing but a table showing the schedule of product pickups. It contains details like who is going to pick up from the farmer, what product they are picking up, date, etc.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-the-logistics-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - The logistics -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But who exactly is delivering the products, picking up the product you might wonder? Right now, we don't have a solid logistics in place, but what we do have is a logistics interface.&lt;br&gt;
Logistics interface is a table where all the ongoing orders are listed. Ideally an authorized personal like an employee will be able to access this portal. But for now, we can play around by updating the status of a particular order to 'delivered' or 'picking up' and the status of that order would change accordingly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/DrrpGflcMF037HPPYa/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/DrrpGflcMF037HPPYa/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-consumer-role-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Consumer Role Overview-
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consumer, the user will be able to browse through products, search for a product, etc. Atlas Search has made autocomplete and other searches much simpler and convenient! After landing on a particular product, the user can select the quantity and add the product to the cart. The user can then proceed to checkout by selecting an appropriate delivery address and make payment. After the payment is complete (In the test mode in RazorPay API for now), the order now becomes an ongoing order.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-purchasing-a-product-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Purchasing a product -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consumer can add a particular product to their cart as well as edit quantities. The consumer pick the delivery address and makes payment (RazorPay API) through the system.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/W7wTbKcNH290Frtjoy/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/W7wTbKcNH290Frtjoy/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-review-and-rating-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  -  Review and rating -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user will be able to comment and rate only after purchasing a product. There are no restrictions on viewing the review and ratings.&lt;br&gt;
All ratings and reviews will be visible on each item’s page along with the average of all ratings as the item’s average rating.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-the-bidding-system-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - The bidding system -
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature that we have implemented is the bidding system. A user can bid on a product. A farmer can see all bids on their product. A farmer can accept bids on their product. After a farmer accepts a bid, an email is sent by the system to the user to directly contact the farmer for acting further on the bid. This feature is developed targeting bulk buyers.&lt;br&gt;
This will help them get products at a cheaper price than the current market price. The farmer can view bids as well as accept a bid. This will help the farmer sell excess produce or gain a good profit owning to bulk consumers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/ZhT3gDqR3oBNl6jYdD/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/ZhT3gDqR3oBNl6jYdD/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-market-analysis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Market Analysis-
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have performed some basic analysis of the market. We have implemented some basic Realm triggers and functions to support us with the same. We plan to further improve on report generation of the analysis and statistics of the market to gain an insight into the business strategies that can be used to target a larger audience while maintaining a loyal customer base. This feature will help the company in making informed decisions with the data right in front of them.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-aidfarmers-aid"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Aid-Farmer’s Aid
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a place where farmers can educate themselves on various current ongoings in the agricultural sector. They can see a variety of information which would help them in making future decisions regarding agriculture.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-search-barsearch-products-on-the-go"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  - Search Bar-Search products on the go!
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/R3wnyEBjZeovBUdgwT/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/R3wnyEBjZeovBUdgwT/giphy.gif" alt="Alt Text" width="480" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Technically speaking, we have developed a bunch of APIs in the backend that perform simple CRUD operations on the database and are consumed by the frontend to send and retrieve data. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-it-up-heres-everything-in-a-nutshell"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping it up, here's everything in a nutshell!
&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;a href="#whats-next-for-krishibazaar"&gt;

  What's next for KrishiBazaar
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of features are on our to-do list now! Scaling the applications, testing, and adding more features while also receiving constant feedback is one of my major goals!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have developed a small social network web app for educational purpose and want to share this with the community. This app is built with ReactJS for frontend, Java Spring Boot for backend and MongoDB as the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app tries to mimic a few functions of Twitter, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create post with text and image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like, comment and re-post a post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments are toggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow, un-follow someone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See who are following us and follow them back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check who we are following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View all posts of an individual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View our own posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to limited storage space, client app compresses the uploaded image to the maximum of 250px (width or height)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User avatar is created by hashing user id and convert that hash code into a hexagonal image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication and authorization use JWT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive frontend for desktop and mobile devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical stack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Bootstrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Java Spring Boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this project is useful for you , please give me a Github star ⭐ for my effort!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How AI is used for mental health therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the current mental health screening system relies too heavily on manual assessments, how can sentiment analysis (SA) be used to streamline the new patient screening process and reduce the abysmal 10-week long waitlist to receive help from a therapist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#outline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Outline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s all this jargon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New patient debrief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTRL+F for symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research and considerations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-issue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The issue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a generation of young people who have de-stigmatized mental illness, we are shocked to discover that finding a therapist is as appalling as our dating culture: an arduous ghosting game. Patients wait an average of 10 weeks to see a mental health professional, just to receive a diagnosis! So if you are absolutely thirsty for attention, then there are apps commonly sponsored by YouTubers that match you with a therapist, but results may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it so difficult to receive help? Since we rely solely on a mental health professional to review tens of pages of medical history and questionnaires for each new patient, and with the normalization of mental illness, the supply of qualified mental health professionals cannot keep up with the volume of patients seeking help. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness"&gt;alarming&lt;/a&gt; that while 20% of people are mentally ill at any given time, only 44% get help, and 100% of therapists are exhausted and can’t get up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nT5vsC5i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qnqvmmgc6ka59x5ynhqk.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nT5vsC5i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qnqvmmgc6ka59x5ynhqk.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="314" height="177"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Life alert &lt;a href="https://memegenerator.net/Help-IVe-Fallen-And-I-CanT-Get-Up"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#treatment-plan"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Treatment plan
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can machine learning help in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we’ll be exploring how a method of sentiment analysis, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;named entity recognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (NER) can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25982909/"&gt;expedite&lt;/a&gt; the new patient screening process for psychologists by categorizing and summarizing large amounts of unwritten responses by patients. This is a powerful information extraction tool that can potentially organize and make sense of otherwise unstructured and qualitative data that we currently rely on extremely specialized, manual labor for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis in therapy is a very new area of study, and the goal is not to replace mental health professionals, but make their jobs easier using machine learning applications. I genuinely hope there is more research in medicine and mental health so that we can not only ease the burden of overworked psychologists dealing with everyone’s Zoom fatigue but also improve accessibility to mental healthcare for those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5ZPQlDzQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/szh1ynmga56h5788s238.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5ZPQlDzQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/szh1ynmga56h5788s238.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="277" height="209"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/modern-problems-require-modern-solutions"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-all-this-jargon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What’s all this jargon?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we discuss any AI, I’d like to spend some time addressing any confusion about the terms I just rattled off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sentiment-analysis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sentiment analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis (SA) is the way AI is able to extract human emotions and intensity through &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/24/5462"&gt;natural language processing&lt;/a&gt; and context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#machine-learning-pipeline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Machine learning pipeline
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end goal of ML is to teach the model to do a task for you. Suppose you are a &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Weeb"&gt;weeb&lt;/a&gt; and want to learn Japanese (did I just expose myself?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rk0QfM0L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zherl6d4654bv3cfsnsf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rk0QfM0L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zherl6d4654bv3cfsnsf.png" alt="Image description" width="646" height="363"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Doki Doki Literature Club &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1308052-doki-doki-literature-club"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sentiment analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (SA) in machine learning akin to learning Japanese from watching 1000 hours of anime (training stage), then going to an authentic Japanese restaurant to eavesdrop on some people speaking Japanese (testing stage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you can’t understand entire statements, you used &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;named entity recognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (NER) to pick up key phrases in the “PEOPLE” category/entity like mother-in-law, husband, and “unreasonable,” and that gives us a general vibe (or sentiment) that they’re likely talking 💩.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#named-entity-recognition"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Named entity recognition
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NER is actually an information extraction algorithm that trains itself on specialized jargon and then categorizes data into pre-labeled entities or concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a better idea of what SA and NER are, let’s see how named entity recognition is useful for psychoanalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-patient-debrief"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  New patient debrief
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using NER, therapists can quickly familiarize themselves with new patients and which intense emotions they feel, behaviors they exhibit, which mental illness they suspect they have using the keywords patients used in their questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this existing implementation of NER on identifying clinical terms in patient charts by &lt;a href="https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/NER_CLINICAL/"&gt;John Snow Labs&lt;/a&gt; (screenshot of demo below) for example: the ML model is able to identify symptoms of illness and treatment methods after learning medical jargon from the PubMD data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3NF5mzfy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/48w87cl3ss7dnok29rnw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3NF5mzfy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/48w87cl3ss7dnok29rnw.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NER_clinical &lt;a href="https://demo.johnsnowlabs.com/healthcare/NER_CLINICAL/"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, for therapists, instead of reading a patient’s entire life story, a sentence like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When I’m feeling anxious, I overthink and lose my appetite.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would be reduced to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;anxious: B-ILLNESS&lt;br&gt;
lose: B-SYMPTOM&lt;br&gt;
my: I-SYMPTOM&lt;br&gt;
appetite: I-SYMPTOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some ideas are multiple words long, we use the “B” tag in front of the entity to indicate the first word in the phrase, and those that follow after with the “I” tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#impact"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Impact
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summary is significant in automating a time-consuming step by allowing therapists to quickly grasp what’s ailing the new patient. Particularly for patients that require care from both a psychiatrist and therapist, it would be revolutionary to have a tool that ensures communication between the medical professionals are concise, detailed, and missing no information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-technical-explanation-of-ner"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A technical explanation of NER
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are the godsend thinking of implementing a sentiment analysis using NER for therapists, thank you, and please refer to SnowLab’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/1.Clinical_Named_Entity_Recognition_Model.ipynb"&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/spark-nlp/named-entity-recognition-for-healthcare-with-sparknlp-nerdl-and-nercrf-a7751b6ad571"&gt;Medium article&lt;/a&gt; as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Else, we can get a general idea of how this NER model by Spark NLP (an open source &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;atural &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;anguage &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;rocessing library) works through the same weeb analogy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you cannot possibly learn Japanese from raw anime episodes, someone has to do the manual labor of adding English subtitles before you watch it. Therefore, we have to convert sentences into a format the NER model understands, CoNLL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my sentence “When I am feeling anxious, I overthink and lose my appetite,” has punctuation removed, and contractions like “I’m” expanded, parts of speech tags added, and is converted into this mess:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--psZ96zI9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p9vz0azdm99rgz4x5rhi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--psZ96zI9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p9vz0azdm99rgz4x5rhi.png" alt="Image description" width="364" height="325"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re kind of confused yet curious, you can find the list for part of speech abbreviations &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15388831/what-are-all-possible-pos-tags-of-nltk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and try this example for yourself using my &lt;a href="https://github.com/Felicious/Freudian-Clip"&gt;code snippet&lt;/a&gt;! Essentially, what’s happening in the code is that we need to separate sentences into individual words, mark their part of speech, and entity labels like in this excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vqqANQR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3dxvf5f8y3l75lhyceky.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vqqANQR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3dxvf5f8y3l75lhyceky.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="431"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;using “Paraiso” from &lt;a href="https://carbon.now.sh/"&gt;carbon.now.sh&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the Spark NLP library has a couple built-in functions that convert sentences into this format, so you don’t need to use the NLTK one I used in my example. The functions are this &lt;a href="https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#tokenizer"&gt;tokenizer&lt;/a&gt; for converting sentences into individual words, and a &lt;a href="https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/docs/en/annotators#postagger-part-of-speech-tagger"&gt;POS tagger&lt;/a&gt; for identifying part of speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since they do not have entity labels for psychology terms like the “emotion” and “behavior” tags I used in my example, we’d need to find a library based on the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm"&gt;The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)&lt;/a&gt; that’ll be used to identify mental illnesses and their symptoms in a piece of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, now that the training data is pre-processed, data scientists can now train the model, test it, and let therapists use it! Let me know when it happens! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ws1xfLZB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f331epockwk25g2rzsri.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ws1xfLZB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f331epockwk25g2rzsri.png" alt="Image description" width="500" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;draw an owl &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ctrlf-for-symptoms"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CTRL+F for symptoms
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or CMD+F for you Mac users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, after identifying the symptoms, emotions, and behaviors of the patient from their questionnaire, we can do a reverse-search to look for more specific information. Let’s say the therapist noticed a patient used sleeping medication and wanted more context and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SnowLab’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/1.Clinical_Named_Entity_Recognition_Model.ipynb"&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt;, for example, they wrote a search function called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;get_clinical_entities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that finds all mentions of medications for 100 patients, as well as specifications, if any, about the quantity and frequency the medication is consumed. The location of the sentence in the overall piece is also recorded, to locate the information easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7O-BqtZ0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t82pgzarirxklt1v24ks.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7O-BqtZ0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t82pgzarirxklt1v24ks.png" alt="Image description" width="646" height="590"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;from line 51 of &lt;a href="https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/1.Clinical_Named_Entity_Recognition_Model.ipynb"&gt;NER_clinical&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this information is identified, therapists can request data scientists to help them analyze and visualize trends in patient medical histories, and whether treatments are effective or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a potential usage of analyzing a patient’s medication history for psychiatrists is monitoring whether the medicine they’re taking has improved their condition. It would be a lot to keep track of the condition of the numerous psychiatric patients, how dosages of several medications affect them, and whether there are unexpected side effects over time, but &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;detecting anomalies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;finding trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is what machine learning is great at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if certain medication is proven to be successful for a statistically significant number of patients with ADHD who experience the symptoms “x, y, and z,” it is crucial that this discovery is shared with a medical professional. While additional research is required, ML can expedite this cross-referencing process for psychiatrists. One possible application is an attempt at unbiased data reporting by generating a list of ADHD patients taking this medication, detailing whether they’ve recovered or not, the duration of consumption, and the side effects they experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#further-research-and-considerations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Further research and considerations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more ways sentiment analysis would improve the quality of therapy and assist mental health professionals in treating more patients. In addition to the ways textual information extraction SAs determine emotion in unstructured, self-reported medical reports, other forms of sentiment analysis could improve other facets of mental healthcare, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classifier, based on various parameters describing patient condition, of whether a patient could be in a bad mental state and harm themselves. A support vector machine (SVM) is allegedly one of the best ML approaches that predict the polarity of a sentiment, according to the 3rd reference (“Emotion AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow quantifying a severity score of a patient’s condition to indicate they’re in critical condition and get them help faster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the personalized nature of therapy, it can also be difficult to get definitive feedback from patients. In this study, researchers have been trying to identify which words exchanged between therapist and patient were most effective at treating their illness using natural language processing (NLP). This is the umbrella sentiment analysis falls under&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to normalize qualitative data, like subjective description of emotions, so that a patient who describes their emotions more animatedly does not receive a biased score over a patient who keeps things to themselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a medical professional, data scientist, or someone with an interest, I thank you for taking the time to consider all of these ways sentiment analysis can benefit therapy. I believe your work and contribution to research in using machine learning to improve the quality of healthcare is noble and greatly appreciated in these times when we’re experiencing a mental health crisis and a shortage in healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful that the two most important people in my life have access to mental healthcare, and I hope that with further interdisciplinary research, this accessibility is extended to more people’s loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

  Overview of My Submission
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately today there are many species in danger of extinction or disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPECIESS is a space that aims to help a little to raise awareness about this problem as a website to create, explore and share artworks with CSS on endangered species taken from the IUCN Red List&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it at: &lt;a href="https://speciess.vercel.app/"&gt;speciess.vercel.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This project is born as an initiative for the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-mongodb-atlas-hackathon-on-dev-4b6m" rel="nofollow"&gt;Atlas MongoDB &amp;amp; Dev.to Hackaton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPECIESS is an space where to create, explore and share CSS art about endangered species (from the IUCN Red List) and so spread raise awareness about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; project bootstrapped with &lt;a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app"&gt;&lt;code&gt;create-next-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, run the development server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;npm run dev
&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; or&lt;/span&gt;
yarn dev&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; with your browser to see the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Learn More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/docs" rel="nofollow"&gt;Next.js Documentation&lt;/a&gt; - learn about Next.js features and API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/learn" rel="nofollow"&gt;Learn Next.js&lt;/a&gt; - an interactive Next.js tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;div class="gh-btn-container"&gt;&lt;a class="gh-btn" href="https://github.com/leviarista/speciess"&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This project is built using &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; and deployed with &lt;a href="https://vercel.com"&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using the powerful &lt;a href="https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database"&gt;MongoDB Atlas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This DB is storing information about 142 000 species from the &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/"&gt;IUCN Red List&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's my first time using MongoDB and I found it quite easy to get started with, even with a lot of documentation, but understandable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am using the &lt;a href="https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/api/data-api/"&gt;MongoDB Data API&lt;/a&gt; to store some info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was very interesting and comfortable to use &lt;a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/"&gt;MongoDB Charts&lt;/a&gt; in this project too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some screenshots of the project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I really liked how powerful MongoDB Atlas is, my only observation would be that it would be great to add more examples with more use cases for Node.js 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Product Catalog Web App with Flask, Vue and Mongo</title>
      <author>valentinesean</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:23:36 +0000</pubDate>

  Overview of My Submission
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Catalog web app is a simple catalog where user named Supplier will create products and Customer will browse these products on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product has few information such as product name, category of the product, supplier of the product, to mention only 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer can search based on product name, category name or first name of the supplier (this is done by Flask with Atlas Search). After receiving search results, they can also filter those search results (This is done by Vue in the browser).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROLES SUMMARY: Supplier -&amp;gt; (creates product); Customer -&amp;gt; (search among products, rate the product)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built the app using Flask, Vue and MongoDB. Vue is responsible for displaying data stored in MongoDB to users and Flask is serving as an interface between MongoDB and Vue. Products' images are stored in Cloudinary using its public API.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explaining Kubernetes for Developers Who Know How to Code</title>
      <author>Ali</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:22:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/endingwithali/explaining-kubernetes-for-developers-who-know-how-to-code-1473</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/endingwithali/explaining-kubernetes-for-developers-who-know-how-to-code-1473</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how to program - you're in your first or second year of your first software engineering job. You've mastered the basics and are excelling at your job, but something's been bothering you. You keep hearing about this thing called Kubernetes being thrown around by another team. Kuber...netes? What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the third or fourth time you hear it, you decide to look it up. You get what it does, but you don't really get what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't worry—I’m here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/what-is-kubernetes"&gt;reading this article by fellow Relic John Withers&lt;/a&gt; - it's an excellent primer of basic colloquialisms and technical terms used when diving into the world of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hi-welcome-to-the-container-store"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hi, welcome to the container store.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most starter tutorials will explain how to deploy a basic "Hello World" server in the language of your choice. But it doesn't really do much except return an endpoint that says "Hello World.” What do you learn from that? Why is it always a web server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a step back and remember that any type of application can be containerized and deployed using Kubernetes. Even the hit game from 2002, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_Magic"&gt;Petz: Dogz 5&lt;/a&gt;, can be run using k8s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it actually make sense to put Petz: Dogz 5 into a container and deploy with Kubernetes? Maybe, maybe not. But say we wanted to run 10,000 instances of Petz: Dogz 5 or we wanted to access the game 10,000 times at once, all simultaneously. Then yes, using Kubernetes makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Petz: Dogz 5 doesn’t use the internet. Kubernetes must require the internet, right? Not exactly. Connectivity is a must, but things like intranet allow for connection without using actual internet, creating isolated instances. Keeping it straight forward, while you can run things on k8s that do not need internet access, you’ll need connectivity in order to access the k8s cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#memenetes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Memenetes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has been the subject of memes...a lot. Why? Because in reality, setting up Kubernetes is hard. It's confusing and it takes a long time to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7i7elhBd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c8tnf6b2i8vmc7xf3cia.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7i7elhBd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c8tnf6b2i8vmc7xf3cia.jpg" alt="Evil Kubernetes be like shuts down containers when needed&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
" width="750" height="499"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once set up and configured properly, it's a powerful tool that can save developer time and application uptimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when should one start using Kubernetes? And why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-what-where-when-why-of-kubernetes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who? What? Where? When? Why? of Kubernetes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-what"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who? + What?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, anyone can run anything using Kubernetes. Usually, you'll find it being utilized by DevOps teams to help scale their company's services to meet incoming demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is run on a server (managing it yourself is known as “rolling your own Kubernetes”) or handled by vendor or cloud service provider as a managed Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, you can start using Kubernetes on day one of building a project, but it doesn't matter when you start using it. The choice is up to the developers and the DevOps team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘why’ question is where it gets a little more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Kubernetes, launching an application of any kind requires three different parts: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A compiled version of the code: provided by you and built in a form that can be easily run (such as binary). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An operating system: this might be your computer or something you set up manually, but could also be a container or use a buildpack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A start command: The command used to execute your codes such as a binary or run statement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kubernetes-x-docker-best-friends-forever"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kubernetes x Docker: Best Friends Forever
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you hear Kubernetes, you're probably going to hear Docker in the same sentence. Kubernetes and Docker are like peanut butter and jelly—they're a perfect pair. Docker combines the three parts required to launch an application into one command. This makes it easier to deploy (or start) new applications through the creation of containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers are a critical part of the Kubernetes metaverse because they're the smallest building block of Kubernetes orchestration. Just like how atoms are the smallest bits of matter in the universe, pods are encapsulations of containers. Pods are considered a unit of one or more containers. All the containers in a pod will be co-located on the same operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scale
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes can help make scaling your application easier. It's a distributed system that can automatically spin up new pods to help balance the load of incoming requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you've just shared your side project on ProductHunt and HackerNews. As the creator, you're responsible for maintaining your side project's uptime and making sure that it works. It's starting to pick up popularity, and you see that your previous configuration is starting to max out at its ability to stay running. Did I mention that your project just blew up on Tiktok, and you've gone from 100 visits per day to over 10,000? It also just hit top of HackerNews - everyone is talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the influx of users trying out your side project, you need to scale - fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to implementing Kubernetes, you would need to go to your hosting site (either via a website for the cloud or on premises for non-cloud servers), manually provision the servers, run the containers, and set up the reverse proxies to handle incoming router traffic. With Kubernetes, this process is mostly automated. Since you were conveniently creating this side project to try to learn Kubernetes, you were prepared. To scale with the huge influx of demand, you're able to quickly update your Kubernetes config file to begin rolling out scaling changes for your side project.&lt;/p&gt;

  By the way, New Relic 💙's Kubernetes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've just set up your first Kubernetes cluster or are looking to understand the Kubernetes cluster you've been running, look no further. I'm a visual learner, and having a tool like New Relic is critical for helping create awesome visualizations for your clusters.

&lt;p&gt;As a developer, it's easy to forget to slow down, to get frustrated when learning new topics, and to gloss over asking why when one is confused. Hopefully, by reading this article, you've gained a bit more practical knowledge about Kubernetes and why you keep hearing about it everywhere you go.  &lt;/p&gt;
