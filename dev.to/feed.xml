  &lt;a href="#what-is-procrastination"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Procrastination?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who procrastinate are often mislabeled as lazy. Many of us even engage in self talk about how lazy or unfocused we are when we engage in procrastination. But procrastination is not a reflection of someone’s work ethic or their ability to focus. There’s more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic procrastinators know that waiting will cause more harm than good. We know that this choice will ultimately lead to a worse outcome for us physically, emotionally, and otherwise, but we do it anyway&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-real-reason-we-procrastinate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Real Reason We Procrastinate
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Pychyl is also a professor of psychology and a member of the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. He said, “Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem.” Sirois and Pychyl teamed up in 2013 to research the notion that people place a priority on their immediate emotional needs over those of their future selves via procrastination. Here’s what they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with an “aversive” task, i.e. something that we find “boring, frustrating, lacking in meaning and/or structure,” we react with negative feelings and moods. Then we have a choice. We can get through those feelings and moods via “self-regulation” or we can succumb to the immediately protective choice of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem-with-procrastination"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem with Procrastination
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that when we sit down to work tomorrow, or next week, or next month before the big deadline, we will feel like doing it. But we are wrong. When we choose the temporary reprieve from boredom, frustration, or challenge and kick the can down the road to our future selves, we are only making matters cumulatively worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, a constant current of anxiety and tension will be along for the entire procrastination ride. This nagging looming deadline will be churning in the background, coloring our daily mood and impacting our health and well being. The negative feelings we have about the task itself make us procrastinate. That, in turn, leads to ruminating negative thoughts about the act of procrastination itself. It’s a cycle that has a snowball effect, gathering more self blame, shame, anxiety, and stress along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#techniques"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Techniques
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-daily-todo-list-dont-forget-to-readupdate-it-daily-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Daily Todo List (Don't forget to read/update it daily !)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a list of 3-6 things that you want to get done during the day. Put them in order of the most important or time sensitive to the least important or time sensitive. Start working on the first task until it is finished. Check it off, mark it out, and move to the next item. Keep going until your the end of the day. Move any tasks that are left undone to the new list you will create for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Remember to start the day by reading the current list of tasks and update it if it is needed.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-digitally-declutter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Digitally Declutter
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it. Distractions are very easily found these days. If you tend to wander into social media or headline news or your personal inbox instead of working on the more pressing task at hand, it’s time to digitally declutter your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to make it harder to get distracted by removing the devices that hold those distractions. So, let’s say you need to create an outline for an upcoming presentation and you plan to work at the breakfast counter in the kitchen. Take only your laptop into the workspace. Put your phone, tablet, and any other devices you may have in another room and make sure they are on silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close all tabs other than the document you are actively writing into. If you find that you cannot stop opening new windows to browse online, go old school and pull out an actual pad of paper and pen to write your outline in ink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take this a step further, declutter your actual devices so that distractions are not as easily accessible. Remove social media apps from your devices, delete games, and create folders to organize essential apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Remember to keep a specific workspace based on your task in order to avoid distractions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-bundle-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Bundle Up
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all love a package deal. Bring the bundle up benefit into your life to get things done. This technique works very well for self care and health habits as well as household chores and responsibilities that we all find so easy to put off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are generally only accountable to ourselves for things like working out, mowing the grass, cleaning the house, cooking healthy meals, or doing the laundry. Make these tasks less tiresome and more appealing by bundling them with something you really love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If audiobooks are your jam, only listen to them when you are cleaning the house. Catch up on your favorite podcasts only while you cut the grass or cook dinner. Watch the latest binge-worthy show only when you are on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Find the trick to do annoying chores in a funny way.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-set-a-timer-ex-custom-podomoro-flow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Set a Timer (Ex: Custom, Podomoro, Flow)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can accomplish staggering volumes of work simply by committing to show up and do the work for a set period of time, no matter what. Writers past and present have found success with time techniques but it works with a wide variety of tasks. Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a task that you want to get done. This can be a routine, daily responsibility or a special project or work product you need to produce on a particular deadline. Decide how much time you have to work on the task each day or in this particular work period. It could be 15 minutes, 2 hours, or 60 seconds...pick a time period that makes sense for the task at hand. Set a timer for that time period and don’t stop until the timer goes off. No matter what!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what if your kid comes in the room and needs help with their lesson? What if you need to take a bathroom break? What if the doorbell rings or your mom calls or the dog starts barking madly to go out? Look, life happens. We know that. Hit the pause button on the timer, take care of the immediate need, and get right back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Remember to start the timer each time you pick a task.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-worst-thing-first"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Worst Thing First
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little psychological trick that is both effective and super rewarding. Think about all the things you want to do today or that should happen everyday. Take care of the task that is the least appealing as soon as humanly possible. Get it over with and move on to the things that are more engaging, easy, and fun, or just less frustrating, dull, or challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that “worst thing” is finished and done, there will be an immediate lift in spirit and a real sense of accomplishment. Ride that wave of success forward knowing that things will only get better from there! Worst Thing First is motivating, rewarding, and really works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Remember to not pick the easiest task first&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>TIP: Never leave your email address raw in the mailto link! Here's what to do instead</title>
      <author>Naseki</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:36:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/naseki/tip-never-leave-your-email-address-raw-in-the-mailto-link-here-s-what-to-do-instead-1c70</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/naseki/tip-never-leave-your-email-address-raw-in-the-mailto-link-here-s-what-to-do-instead-1c70</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Usually, when you leave your email address on your website for people to click on, you may do something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mailto:name@example.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;name@example.com&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, however, the perfect recipe to get spam into your email!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#this-is-how-email-harvesting-works"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  This is how email harvesting works
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for spambots to get a nice long list of emails to annoy people to click their suspicious-looking links, they use email harvesters to curate these lists. Emails are typically found on websites where people leave theirs to be contacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people think this is easy to solve simply by masking the email like &lt;code&gt;name[AT]example[DOT]com&lt;/code&gt;. This, however, doesn't solve anything due to two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mailto link still contains the actual email address as you can't replace it with the one above. Since email harvesters look into the source code of your website, they'd still be able to get your email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most email harvesters are advanced enough to detect common patterns like [AT] and (AT) and such, so they won't do much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#encode-your-email-address"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Encode your email address
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's a way to make your email address unreadable for email harvesters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have seen characters like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in HTML before. These are called &lt;strong&gt;HTML entities&lt;/strong&gt;. These are symbols that have been encoded so they won't be mistaken for HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what not many people know is that you can encode every single character into an HTML entity. And even better, putting these into your hrefs will convert them back into regular text for normal visitors that are visiting your website rather than looking at the source code. It's perfect for this situation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML entities for regular letters are made of HEX encoding. The HTML entities would look like like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#HEXCODE;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-do-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's do it!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://onlineutf8tools.com/convert-utf8-to-html-entities"&gt;this handy tool&lt;/a&gt; to convert! Make sure to copy the entire href link, not just your email address!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bx2J00S0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4wp8z4lq06l79pradccx.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Bx2J00S0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4wp8z4lq06l79pradccx.jpg" alt="Example screenshot of how to convert the link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, copy-paste that string into your href and you're done! Here's how it should look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x61;&amp;amp;#x69;&amp;amp;#x6c;&amp;amp;#x74;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;colon;&amp;amp;#x6e;&amp;amp;#x61;&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;commat;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;#x78;&amp;amp;#x61;&amp;amp;#x6d;&amp;amp;#x70;&amp;amp;#x6c;&amp;amp;#x65;&amp;amp;period;&amp;amp;#x63;&amp;amp;#x6f;&amp;amp;#x6d;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My email&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This makes the whole thing a lot harder to decypher for most email harvesters. That, while still keeping the link clickable for others! On top of that, using inspect element to check the HTML gives you the decoded email, even though the source code has it encoded!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JKcxuq0B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vb34uh9ajgg3gohr8aa7.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JKcxuq0B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vb34uh9ajgg3gohr8aa7.jpg" alt="Comparison of devtools and source code"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it still ends up being readable for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's even better if you use some non-traditional way of masking your email address in the actual text, or just don't use your email at all (like in the sample above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're all good now! No more disappointments that you think you just got a client but it turns out to be spam!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ay3KzHPn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/85t5l2vp28xdw748e2tv.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ay3KzHPn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/85t5l2vp28xdw748e2tv.gif" alt="Good job fellow dev"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;

      <title>5 Key Lessons React Tutorials Don't Teach</title>
      <author>Reed Barger</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 17:15:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/reedbarger/5-key-lessons-react-tutorials-don-t-teach-5pb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/reedbarger/5-key-lessons-react-tutorials-don-t-teach-5pb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many essential concepts and lessons that React developers need to know that simply aren't covered in most tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have handpicked the topics I believe are some of the most important for you to know, but few articles have dedicated the time to cover in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at five key React lessons worth knowing which you might not find elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to learn all the skills you need to become a highly-paid React developer? Check out the &lt;a href="https://reactbootcamp.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Bootcamp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-how-react-state-is-actually-updated"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. How React state is actually updated
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a React developer, you know that state can be created and updated with the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;useReducer&lt;/code&gt; hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happens exactly when you update a component's state with either of these hooks? Is the state updated immediately or is it done at some later time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the following code, which it's a very simple counter application. As you would expect, you can click on the button and our counter increases by 1.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&amp;gt; {/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what if we attempt to add an additional line, which also updates our count by one. What do you think will happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click on the button, will our displayed count increase by one or two?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&amp;gt; {/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we run this code we see it's incremented only by one! Despite attempting to increment the count by one twice, with two separate state updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does our counter display 1, despite clearly incrementing state by 1 two times?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that React schedules a state update to be performed when we call when we update state the first time. Because it is just scheduled and is not performed immediately (it is asynchronous and not synchronous), our &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; variable is not updated before we attempt to update it a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, because the state updated is scheduled, not performed immediately, the second time we called &lt;code&gt;setCount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is still just &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that we can fix this to update state reliably, despite state updates being asynchronous, is to use the inner function that's available within the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; setter function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to get the previous state and return the value that we want it to be in the body of the inner function. When we use this pattern, we see that it's incremented by two like we originally wanted:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prevCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-its-better-to-use-multiple-effects-instead-of-one"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. It's better to use multiple effects instead of one
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When performing a side effect, most React developers will &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; just once and attempt to perform multiple side effects within the same effect function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that look like? Below you can see where we are fetching both post and comment data in one useEffect hook to be put in their respective state variables:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setComments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetching post data&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fetching comments data&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setComments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PostsList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CommentsList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of attempting to cram all of your side effects into a single effect hook, just as you can use the state hook more than once, you can use several effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so allows us to separate our different actions into different effects for a better separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better separation of concerns is a major benefit that React hooks provide as compared to using lifecycle methods within class components. In methods like &lt;code&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/code&gt;, for example, it was necessary to include any action that we want it to be performed after our component mounted. You could not break up your side effects into multiple methods; each lifecycle method in classes can be used once and only once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major benefit of React hooks is that we are able to break up our code based upon what it's doing. Not only can we separate actions that we are performing after render into separate into multiple effects, but we can also co-locate our state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setComments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setComments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PostsList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CommentsList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means we can put the state hook with the effect hook that is related to this helps to organize our code much better and better understand what it's doing at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-dont-optimize-functions-that-update-state-usestate-usereducer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Don't optimize functions that update state (useState, useReducer)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common task whenever we pass down a callback function from a parent component to a child component is to prevent it from being recreated, unless its arguments have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can perform this optimization with the help of the &lt;code&gt;useCallback&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useCallback was created specifically for callback functions that are passed to child components to make sure that they are not recreated needlessly, which incurs a performance hit on our components whenever there is a re-render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this being whenever our parent component re-renders, it will cause all child components to re-render as well. This is what causes our callback functions to be recreated on every re-render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we are using a setter function to update state that we've created with the useState or useReducer hooks. We do not need to wrap that with useCallback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is no need to do this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Don't wrap setText in useCallback (it won't change as is)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSetText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSetText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSetText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSetText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleSetText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reason is taken directly from the React documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React guarantees that setState function identity is stable and won't change on re-renders. This is why it's safe to omit from the useEffect or useCallback dependency list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, not only do we not need to optimize it unnecessarily with useCallback, but we also do not need to include it as a dependency within useEffect because it will not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to note because in many cases, it can cut down the code that we need to use and most importantly, it is an unproductive attempt to optimize your code as it can incur performance problems of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-the-useref-hook-can-preserve-state-across-renders"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. The useRef hook can preserve state across renders
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As React developers, it's very helpful sometimes to be able to reference a given React element with the help of a ref. We create refs in React with the help of the &lt;code&gt;useRef&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to note, however, that use ref isn't just helpful for referencing to a certain DOM element. The React documentation says so itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ref object that's created by useRef is a generic container with a current property that's mutable and can hold any value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain benefits to be able to store and update values with useRef. The reason being is that it allows us to store a value that will not be in memory that will not be erased across re-renders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to keep track of a value across renders with the help of a simple variable, it would be reinitialized each time the component renders. However, if you use a ref, the value stored in it will remain constant across renders of your component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is a use case for leveraging useRef in this way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be helpful in the event that we wanted to perform a given side effect on the initial render only, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;hasRendered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasRendered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hasRendered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;perform action only once!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Try running this code yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will see, no matter how many times the button is clicked, state is updated and a re-render takes place, the action we want to perform (see &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt;) is only performed once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-how-to-prevent-your-react-app-from-crashing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. How to prevent your React app from crashing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons for React developers to know, especially if they haven't pushed a React application to the web, is what to do with uncaught errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example below, we are attempting to display a Header component in our app, but are performing an action that results in an error. Namely, attempting to get a property from a null value:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&amp;gt;; /&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we push this code to production, we will see a blank screen exactly like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NnJGazoC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/5-key-lessons-1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NnJGazoC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://reedbarger.com/content/images/2021/04/5-key-lessons-1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do we see nothing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we can find the answer for this within the React documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in development, you see a big red error message with a stack trace that tells you where the error. When your application is live, however, you're just going to see a blank screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the desired behavior that you want for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a way to fix it, or at least show them something that tells the user that an error took place if the application accidentally crashes. You can wrap your component tree in what's called an error boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error boundaries are components that allow us to catch errors and show users a fallback message that tells them that something wrong occurred. That might include instructions on how to dismiss the error (i.e. reloading the page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that we can use an error boundary is with the help of the package &lt;code&gt;react-error-boundary&lt;/code&gt;. We can wrap it around the component we believe is error-prone. It can also be wrapped around our entire app component tree:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ErrorBoundary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react-error-boundary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ErrorBoundary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FallbackComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ErrorFallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ErrorBoundary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ErrorFallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Oops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also display the error message however you like and style it just like you would any normal component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result that we get when an error does occur is much better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New to DEV? Not sure where to get started? &lt;strong&gt;No worries!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will share &lt;strong&gt;tips&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tricks&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;resources&lt;/strong&gt; that you can use to write amazing articles in no time. This will apply whether you have never written a blog on DEV or you're just looking to improve your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cover quite a lot of information in this post so it might be a bit lengthy, but I'll try my best to not bore you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, take a deep breath, grab some coffee and let's get started! ☕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-basic-structure-of-a-blog-post-on-dev"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The basic structure of a blog post on DEV! 🌊
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some basic tips about structuring and formatting your blog on DEV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choosing-a-title-for-your-blog"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choosing a title for your blog 💡
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you have to choose is the &lt;strong&gt;blog title&lt;/strong&gt;. It is important to have a title that describes what your blog is about. A good title can be the difference between people viewing your blog or skipping over it. Think of your blog title as a one-line summary of your blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I try to do is find &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt; that describe my blog content and include them in the blog title. This ensures that the title is relevant and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tags-tags-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tags, Tags, Tags...🔖
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On DEV, you can add up to &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; tags on your blogs to help people find them. It is better to use existing tags whenever possible instead of making your own. You can view the existing tags on DEV &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tags"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It must be noted that some tags have special guidelines that your blog must fulfill before you can include them in your blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-to-find-cover-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where to find cover images? 🎨
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover images make your blog &lt;strong&gt;standout&lt;/strong&gt;. Blogs with cover images are more likely to be featured in the home feed of the website. Therefore, you must include one in your articles. For finding cover images you can use sites like &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/"&gt;Pexels&lt;/a&gt; or if you want to design one from scratch, you can try &lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/"&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these sources have worked great for me so far. Just try to keep your cover image relevant and fun and you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to add a GIF as a cover image (like in this blog), just copy the GIF link and add it as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
cover_image: your_gif_link
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-add-youtube-videos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's add YouTube videos! 🎥
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to embed &lt;strong&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/strong&gt; in your blogs, you can easily do so using Liquid tags that DEV provides. To embed videos, copy the video id from the URL and add it to the blog as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% youtube your_video_id %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Liquid tags check out the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/p/editor_guide"&gt;editor guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-a-series"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making a series! 📌
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For topics that require more explaining, you can also &lt;strong&gt;make a series&lt;/strong&gt; on DEV. Series are great for topics that have different parts. Instead of cramming all the information in a single article, you can split it up into multiple smaller posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make a series, just give it a name and your blog will automatically be added to that series. Dev will also show a series list at the top of the blogs in that series for navigation (excellent 🙌).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be noted that the series will only appear if it has at least &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finallypublishing-your-amazing-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finally...Publishing your amazing work! 🚀
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you've finished writing the blog post, you can &lt;strong&gt;save the draft&lt;/strong&gt; of the post. This will allow you to share the URL of the article with your friends, family, editor, etc. for proofreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you're satisfied with the final result, you can then &lt;strong&gt;publish&lt;/strong&gt; it for everyone to see. The stats on your blog (view, likes, and comments) can be viewed in the &lt;strong&gt;Profile Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;. You can edit the blog anytime after publishing it, so don't worry if you find any mistake in your blog. Just edit it out! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You've published your first blog on DEV. &lt;strong&gt;Easy, wasn't it?&lt;/strong&gt; After you've done this process a couple of times, it'll become easier and you'll get the hang of it, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-are-some-tips-to-improve-your-writing-and-blog-posts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Here are some tips to improve your writing and blog posts 📝
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some general writing tips including dos and don'ts of writing and choosing where to write the drafts for your blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#markdown-ftw"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Markdown FTW! ⚡
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before writing your blog you must be familiar with the &lt;strong&gt;basics of markdown&lt;/strong&gt; as you'll be using it to write your blogs on DEV. Markdown allows you to format your text, images, lists, etc. very easily. It is super easy to learn too. You can find dozens of cheat sheets floating around the web. I would recommend you give &lt;a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; a look to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choose-where-to-write-drafts-for-your-blogs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choose where to write drafts for your blogs 📜
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've got the hang of markdown, the next thing is to write the draft for your blog. Although you can use the built-in editor that DEV provides, most people prefer to write their blogs on &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/"&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use dedicated note-taking apps like &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; which supports markdown as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever medium you use, I would highly recommend that you install a browser extension called &lt;a href="https://www.grammarly.com/"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;. It is super helpful and will correct most of your grammatical and punctuation errors if not all of them. If you prefer VS Code, use an extension called &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one"&gt;Markdown All in One&lt;/a&gt; as it allows you to preview markdown files and provides various editing options as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dos-and-donts-of-writing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dos and Dont's of writing! 🚨
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing your blogs on DEV, here are some general writing tips to improve the flow of your blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use short and simple sentences&lt;/strong&gt; as to not overwhelm the reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Break up your content&lt;/strong&gt; into smaller paragraphs and add sub-headings to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use relevant images&lt;/strong&gt; in your blogs to explain a topic and make the blog more engaging (And Yes, memes count too! 😅).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Add code snippets&lt;/strong&gt; to your blogs to explain programming concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Include useful links and references&lt;/strong&gt; to provide additional information in your articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don't spam your social media&lt;/strong&gt; links in your blog. No one wants to follow such a person. Try to provide value to others. If you want, just plug one or two social links at the end of the blog post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#simple-gtgt-complex"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Complex 😵
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genius is making complex ideas simple, not making simple ideas complex" &lt;strong&gt;~ Albert Einstein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KISS&lt;/strong&gt; (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle applies here as well. Keep your blog posts short and simple. No one has the time to read blogs that look like research papers. I am guilty of this habit as well. But you should keep your blogs concise and limited to &lt;strong&gt;5-7 min max&lt;/strong&gt; in most cases (although there can be some exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, try to explain the concept in the easiest way possible so people with little to no background knowledge can also understand the concept without pulling their hair out. 😫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#published-your-blog-lets-share-it-now"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Published your blog? Let's share it now! 🦄
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will go over properly cross-posting your blogs from other platforms and sharing your articles on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#canonical-urls-are-no-joke"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Canonical URLs are no joke! 🔗
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you're just writing blogs on DEV and not republishing from elsewhere, feel free to skip this section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you're republishing your blogs from elsewhere whether it be Medium, Hashnode, or your personal website, &lt;strong&gt;read carefully&lt;/strong&gt;. It is important that you add a &lt;strong&gt;Canonical URL&lt;/strong&gt; to your articles published elsewhere on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Canonical URL tells the search engines like &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;, where the original source of the content/article is. If you don't add a canonical article to your blog, the search engine will consider it as duplicate content. And there is a high chance that the republished version on DEV will &lt;strong&gt;rank higher&lt;/strong&gt; on search results as compared to the one originally published on your personal blog. Consequently, you'll get less traffic on your website which is no fun. 😥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, DEV allows you to easily add a Canonical URL to your blog posts and also displays an &lt;strong&gt;" Originally published on XYZ.com "&lt;/strong&gt; message at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_KgmCIwb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k2a666vl25hsa9974s0a.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_KgmCIwb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k2a666vl25hsa9974s0a.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sharing-your-blogs-on-social-media"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sharing your blogs on social media! 🐹
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After publishing your article on DEV, you can then share the link on social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin, etc. The official Twitter account of DEV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;@ThePracticalDev&lt;/a&gt; also shares blog posts that are good and get featured. This is a very nice gesture, as you can get a &lt;strong&gt;far greater reach&lt;/strong&gt; in this way, especially if you're just starting out and don't have a huge audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thats-all-folks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  That's all folks! 🙏
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions feel free to ask me in the comments 👇and I will do my best to answer them. Feel free to read some of my other blogs on DEV &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/fahadimran28"&gt;@fahadimran28&lt;/a&gt;
. Till then, thanks for reading, and happy coding! 😄&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post originally published on &lt;a href="https://charliegerard.dev"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, we released dark mode in beta on the &lt;a href="https://app.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify app&lt;/a&gt;. While we're still iterating on it, it is currently only available via &lt;a href="https://app.netlify.com/user/labs"&gt;Netlify labs&lt;/a&gt; and then under the user's settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it is not that many clicks to get there, it felt like too many to me and while waiting to have it easily accessible in the nav, I wondered... Wouldn't it be fun to be able to toggle it by clapping your hands, just like some home automation devices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I spent a part of the weekend looking into how to build it, and ended up with a &lt;strong&gt;Chrome extension using TensorFlow.js and a model trained with samples of me clapping my hands, that toggles dark mode on/off!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b61oJpKo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0st1jix05tu4xtap385.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b61oJpKo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0st1jix05tu4xtap385.gif" alt="Clapping hands to toggle dark mode and then again to toggle light mode"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUN!!! 😃 Or at least, to me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here is how I went about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#training-the-model"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Training the model
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I trained the model to make sure detecting sounds of clapping hands would work. To make it way easier and faster, I used the &lt;a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"&gt;Teachable machine&lt;/a&gt; platform, and more specifically, started an &lt;a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/audio"&gt;audio project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yfSMo5OZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hijoioam964ee6g0qdse.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yfSMo5OZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hijoioam964ee6g0qdse.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section is to record what your current background sounds like. Then, you can create multiple "classes" to record samples of sounds for activities you would like to use in your project, in this case, clapping hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I record samples for a few more classes, if I know that I'm gonna use this model in an environment where there will be more kinds of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I also recorded samples of speech so the model would be able to recognise what speech "looks like" and not mistake it for clapping hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you're done recording your samples, you can move on to training your model, preview that it works as expected and export it to use it in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-the-chrome-extension"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building the Chrome extension
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not gonna go into too much detail about how to build a Chrome extension because there are a lot of different options, but here's what I did for mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need at least a &lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; file that will contain details about your extension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Dark mode clap extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Toggle dark mode by clapping your hands!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;manifest_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;permissions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;activeTab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;default_icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode16.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode32.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode48.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode128.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;icons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode16.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode32.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode48.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/images/dark_mode128.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;content_scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;content.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://app.netlify.com/*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;all_frames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most important parts for this project is the permissions and content scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#content-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Content script
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/content_scripts/"&gt;Content scripts&lt;/a&gt; are files that run in the context of web pages, so they have access to the pages the browser is currently visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your configs in the &lt;code&gt;manifest.json&lt;/code&gt; file, this would trigger on any tab or only specific tabs. As I added the parameter &lt;code&gt;"matches": ["https://app.netlify.com/*"],&lt;/code&gt;, this only triggers when I'm on the Netlify app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I can start triggering the code dedicated to the sound detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-tensorflowjs-to-detect-sounds"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting up TensorFlow.js to detect sounds
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with TensorFlow.js, I usually export the model as a file on my machine, but this time I decided to use the other option and upload it to Google Cloud. This way, it's accessible via a URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the code sample, an example is provided on Teachable machine when you export your model but basically, you need to start by creating your model:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SPEECH_MODEL_TFHUB_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//URL of your model uploaded on Google Cloud.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recognizer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkpointURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;model.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;metadataURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;metadata.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// model metadata&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recognizer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;speechCommands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;BROWSER_FFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkpointURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;metadataURL&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recognizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ensureModelLoaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recognizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And once it's done, you can start the live prediction:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;classLabels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;recognizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;wordLabels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// An array containing the classes trained. In my case ['Background noise', 'Clap', 'Speech']&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;recognizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;scores&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// will be an array of floating-point numbers between 0 and 1 representing the probability for each class&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;predictionIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;scores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;scores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// get the max value in the array because it represents the highest probability&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;classLabels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;predictionIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Look for this value in the array of trained classes&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;includeSpectrogram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;probabilityThreshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;invokeCallbackOnNoiseAndUnknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;overlapFactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If everything works well, when this code runs, it should log either "Background noise", "Clap" or "Speech" based on what is predicted from live audio data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to toggle Netlify's dark mode, I replaced the &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; statement with some small logic. The way dark mode is currently implemented is by adding a &lt;code&gt;tw-dark&lt;/code&gt; class on the body.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prediction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Clap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;tw-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;tw-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nf-theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;tw-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;nf-theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also update the value in localStorage so it is persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-the-extension"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install the extension
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to test that this code works, you have to install the extension in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Before doing so, you might have to bundle your extension, depending on what tools you used.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install it, the steps to follow are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;code&gt;chrome://extensions&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle &lt;code&gt;Developer mode&lt;/code&gt; located at the top right of the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &lt;code&gt;Load unpacked&lt;/code&gt; and select the folder with your bundled extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CifXQIAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ja9acud37hhus4m6e7ja.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CifXQIAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ja9acud37hhus4m6e7ja.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, you should visit whatever page you want to run your extension on and it should ask for microphone permission to be able to detect live audio, and start predicting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it! Overall, this project wasn't even really about toggling dark mode but I've wanted to learn about using TensorFlow.js in a Chrome extension for a while so this seemed like the perfect opportunity! 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out the code, &lt;a href="https://github.com/charliegerard/dark-mode-clap-extension"&gt;here's the repo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can now tick that off my never-ending list. ✅&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Basic Concepts that are important in React</title>
      <author>Kiran Raj R</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:31:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-basic-concepts-that-are-important-in-react-3icn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-basic-concepts-that-are-important-in-react-3icn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I start learning React I was baffled by some of the codes blocks, I don't understand how the code works or how the output was generated. So I begin to dig into react ecosystem to understand the concepts and I found myself in no man's land, I was lost and frustrated. The reason, I was not thorough in my JavaScript(still not) basics. I skipped some topics believing that I fully understand the working. Due to the lack of knowledge in JavaScript basics I fell into many awkward situations not knowing how to solve certain problem or what method I should use, I lost too much time, and I don't want anyone to have the same experience as mine. So I like you to study at least the following topics in JavaScript before you jump into React. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-classes-part-1-3l6b"&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-modules-5ad5"&gt;Modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-rest-and-spread-fk5"&gt;Rest, spread&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-destructuring-4dpb"&gt;Destructuring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-higher-order-functions-3gi1"&gt;Higher order functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/kiranrajvjd/javascript-arrow-functions-5aa2"&gt;Arrow functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is not the ultimate list, just the few topic I found most important. All topic are important but try to understand at least the following which will definitely help you. I have linked post that I write about the topic, it may help you. Some of the topics are not completing as I am trying to learn more about those topic and will be updated. I would be happy if you point out my mistakes which will help me to learn better. If you have any resources please feel free to share. Let's learn together :) Happy coding :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Coding Journey - Becoming A Software Engineer in Under 1 Year</title>
      <author>Sandra Spanik</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:15:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sanspanic/my-coding-journey-becoming-a-software-engineer-in-under-1-year-12de</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sanspanic/my-coding-journey-becoming-a-software-engineer-in-under-1-year-12de</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've written my first line of code exactly one year ago. Today, I'm preparing to start my new job as software engineer. Here's my story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-interview-to-end-all-interviews"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🌪️ The Interview to End All Interviews 🌪️
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, I ran out of an interview room with tears streaming down my face. I was interviewing for yet another administrative role at an educational institution I had precisely zero desire to actually do. The first part of the interview consisted of an Excel test, which I bombed - atomically. I remember already being at the verge of tears when the nice HR lady led me to the second room where I was to meet the interview panel, consoling me along the way and giving me well-meaning advice. "&lt;em&gt;Don't worry - you can make up for this! Go meet the panel with your head held high!&lt;/em&gt;" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heeding her advice, I held my head high as I promptly proceeded to knock over the glass of water the panel had prepared for me. &lt;em&gt;Excellent start&lt;/em&gt;. The rest of the interview went by in a similar fashion, and by the end of it, it was clear to everyone and their mum that I didn't want the job, they didn't want to hire me, and that it was absurd we were all in the same room. When I got asked what topic's addition to their institution's curriculum graduates might benefit from, I went silent for a couple of seconds, then laughed and said, as a graduate of said institution, "Interview Skills". The joke landed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Exact, Unexaggerated Replica of My Mental State Post-Interview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztq9bsJps4ljwZ2/source.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img width="60%" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztq9bsJps4ljwZ2/source.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this tragic event I took the dramatic vow to &lt;strong&gt;never ever ever EVER interview for anything EVER again&lt;/strong&gt;. I would die poor and hungry, but save myself the humiliation of continuously competing for and losing out on something I found deeply uninspiring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lockdown"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏡 Lockdown 🏡
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 2 months. It's now April 2020. Lockdown has robbed me of any distractions. I have ample time on my hands and I choose to invest it in learning new things. First, I do a Harvard MOOC on the chemistry of cooking. Many mouldy kombucha attempts and a now 12th-generation sour-dough starter called Bob later, I abandon my culinary aspirations and decide to replace pretending to be a Masterchef with watching Masterchef. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#enter-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🖥️ Enter Coding 🧮
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could I learn next? How about something I've always found fascinating, incredibly cool but equally intimidating? There was no time pressure, for what seemed like the first time in years. I might as well get creative. Having a history of ascribing God-like qualities to and immediately falling in love with anyone capable of using a terminal, I knew just what I wanted to attempt to learn next: &lt;strong&gt;coding&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;me, in love, after seeing virtually anyone use a terminal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/PFo2HrqCjC0bm/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img width="60%" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/PFo2HrqCjC0bm/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#colt-steele-the-absolute-legend"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  😻 Colt Steele, The Absolute Legend 🐔
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to stumble upon Colt Steele's &lt;a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/"&gt;modern Python bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;. I purchased in on sale, and it remains the best £14 I've ever spent in my entire life. (&lt;em&gt;I pity the fool that purchases a full-price Udemy course - there's a sale almost every month.&lt;/em&gt;) I have come to be a great fan of his teaching style and admire the rigour and depth he applies to explaining concepts. Before I knew it, I was dreaming about writing code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that at this point, my story could have easily branched off in a different direction. I could have abandoned coding the second it got tricky, and thrown my Mac out along with the last remnants of my misguided fermentation attempts. But it felt like something had clicked - turns out, programming perfectly encapsulated everything I had always known I was quite good at and loved doing, namely: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;creative problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;nobody ever tells you how inherently creative coding actually it - but it is!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;logical/analytical thinking&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;a trait that wasn't always beneficial in my previous industry - mental health&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;striving for efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I am half-German, after all...&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;learning new things&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;turns out, there's no shortage of things to learn in the realm of code&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pursuing-tech-professionally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  💻 Pursuing Tech Professionally 💻
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got asked what precipitated my decision to pursue coding professionally during one of my interviews. I'm not sure I gave a good answer to this, because in reality, I didn't just wake up one morning and decide "&lt;em&gt;right, tech is where it's at&lt;/em&gt;". &lt;strong&gt;My decision was forming over a number of months, as I explored Python, and later JavaScript and web development via cheap/free online courses.&lt;/strong&gt; I was becoming more and more convinced that I didn't just thoroughly enjoy coding - I was also good at it, and learning at a fast enough pace that I could imagine myself, in the distant future, being quite adept at it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a surprising finding. I grew up in 90s Slovakia, and encountered no computers in an educational settings. Computer science seemed like a field reserved for a select few boys who spent their teenage years hacking away. By the time I was 18, I already considered myself too old to catch up and &lt;strong&gt;a career in tech, consequently, never even seemed to be within my realm of possibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that there are 0 Slovak women my age who were independent and brave enough to become software engineers, but on average, the cultural norm fed girls some limiting beliefs that took me almost a decade to dismantle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-ugly-bits"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🩹 The Ugly Bits 🩹
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefaced this article with a promise to be fully transparent. These early months of learning to code from scratch were not exactly a walk through a rose garden. There were many days when I doubted my ability to learn. Not every topic immediately clicked with me - I cried over async JavaScript and for some reason, Axios (which I now love). I also cried over CSS, but who hasn't. It took me a while to adopt a beneficial mindset and stop seeing every bug or knowledge gap as a personal failure. I'm a billion times better at it now, but I'm still not perfect. This is a normal part of the learning process, I'm told. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8JLIwzkt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gem10cpcr331qmtywqlk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8JLIwzkt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gem10cpcr331qmtywqlk.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming is an amazing way of getting comfortable with failing and accepting failure as a good thing. You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; fail over and over again, and that's okay - it's the only way to learn. &lt;strong&gt;I find it amazing that I found a perfect metaphor for life inside a computer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-the-right-bootcamp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🎓 Finding the Right Bootcamp 🎓
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I realised I wanted to transition to tech professionally, I decided to attend a bootcamp. Learning from a structured curriculum curated by expert teachers appealed to me, and the prospect of receiving a certificate to prove my skill felt like the right way to approach my job hunt. I attended &lt;a href="https://www.springboard.com/"&gt;Springboard's&lt;/a&gt; remote-first software engineering bootcamp, designed by Colt Steele The Absolute Legend and Rithm School, one of the world's top 10 bootcamps according to &lt;a href="https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-coding-bootcamps"&gt;SwitchUp&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;note: Colt Steele doesn't actually refer to himself as an Absolute Legend and would likely sigh disappointedly at my doing so. He does have a chicken called Stevie Chicks, however, which proves my moniker correct.&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to have half of my tuition waived. Although, I'm not sure "lucky" is an appropriate word choice here - my tuition was waived due to Springboard's scheme to help out 2 students per cohort who have suffered financially in the pandemic. By August 2020, most of my sources of income had dried up, and I was receiving government assistance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did continue working for a couple of mental health organisations as a contractor, which is part of the reason I chose a remote, self-paced bootcamp. It gave me the freedom to keep working to support myself at least somewhat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#turns-out-bootcamps-are-intense"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏋️‍♀️ Turns Out, Bootcamps Are Intense 🏋️‍♀️
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dedication towards splitting my time between working and studying evenly faded about three months into the bootcamp. &lt;strong&gt;I made the difficult decision to leave one of my contracting gigs behind&lt;/strong&gt;. This felt risky - I already had a tiny income, so reducing it further seemed like a silly idea. But I wanted to put my energy and time where it mattered most - coding, and I didn't like the feeling of falling behind the suggested learning pace because I often had to prioritise work over learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bootcamp was not easy, especially the first couple of months. It often felt lonely and frustrating. I didn't have a cohort to get to know or grow alongside of - all I had was a Slack channel which barely anyone used, and my best pal Google. Whilst I missed out on the social aspect of bootcamps due to the remote nature of mine, the course more than made up for this with a rigorous and extremely well-designed curriculum that focused on depth rather than breadth. &lt;strong&gt;I'm convinced that I owe my job-search success in large part to Springboard's flawless curriculum&lt;/strong&gt;, and no, I'm not being paid to say this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#job-search"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔎 Job Search 🔍
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 90% mark of my bootcamp, I started saying yes to recruiters approaching me on LinkedIn. Initially, I saw this as a good strategy to learn how to interview well, so that by the time I applied for my dream role, I would be ready. But my first ever interview process was with Trustpilot, and it quickly became apparent that I didn't just want to use this opportunity to "practice" - this was THE job, and I wanted it badly. I landed the role, less than a year after I wrote my first line of code. I'm hoping to share useful interview advice in an article that will come later in this series, so if you're keen to hear more, bookmark this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#luck"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ✨ Luck ✨
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the intro, I want to acknowledge the privilege I benefited from. First of all, I spent the year in a supportive and safe environment, and as someone who hasn't always had this, I've come to understand how crucial feeling safe is to personal development. It's nearly impossible to change your life when you have to spend energy on worrying about your own physical or emotional safety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world also kindly decided to go nuts and rob me of any distractions as I spent my days, weeks and months writing code. I am not in any shape or form glad that the pandemic happened, but I do need to acknowledge that one of its repercussions was me suddenly having all the time in the world to examine my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner is my number 1 fan and the world's best &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;rubber-ducky&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst he's not in tech, he is fluent in Python, and his knowledge helped me immensely over the first couple of months. It also helped that, once I quit one of my admin jobs, I only had one part-time gig left and was pretty free to code on most day. Many others in my bootcamp were completing it alongside a full-time job or parental duties. My hat goes off to anyone who is a caretaker or juggling a full-time job whilst re-skilling. You're literally the most inspiring people in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got lucky that a company with values that 100% overlap mine decided to hire a junior at exactly the time I began feeling ready for a job. What is more - the hiring manager, an inspiring person with a plethora of online public speaking videos, specifically told the recruiters that a computer science degree was not a pre-requisite for the role. Had this not been the case, I might have never heard about the position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go into a philosophical debate here, but I will say that I don't believe we have a lot of influence over the luck in our life, and I also don't believe we can "manifest" opportunities by the sheer power of our thoughts, as per The Secret. &lt;strong&gt;The Real Secret is, in my near-scientific and not at all subjective opinion, that hard work prepares us to benefit from those moments in our life when we experience random positive spikes in our fortune.&lt;/strong&gt; So if you make smart choices and spend your energy wisely, you will be more likely to find yourself in a position where you can fully capitalise on random fortuitous opportunities, once they present themselves to you. And in time they likely will, because, well - statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion... &lt;strong&gt;No, it's not too late to switch careers, and yes, you can do it too. Good &lt;del&gt;luck&lt;/del&gt; hard work!  ✨✨✨✨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Command Line Happiness with Terminal Multiplexing (tmux)</title>
      <author>Balamurugan Krishnamoorthy (Bala)</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:07:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/krishnam/dev-productivity-command-line-happiness-with-terminal-multiplexing-5067</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/krishnam/dev-productivity-command-line-happiness-with-terminal-multiplexing-5067</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Should Read It:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who uses the command line daily and not yet explored tmux in-depth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others, check out the 'why should you care' section to see if it can be a valuable addition to your toolbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not really need this blog to use tmux; If you want a technical guidebook, you could look at the manpage for tmux. However, Manpages are seldom adequate to wrap your brain around concepts (why &amp;amp; when); they're there for reference (how-to) sorted alphabetically instead of logically. Here, We will see 'why tmux', some of its practical uses, and how to quickly start using it in your day-to-day workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-should-you-care"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Should You Care
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are working on many projects or many contexts (devOps, development, exploring, etc.). In that case, each needs a set of terminals to control various activities, "creating more tabs &amp;amp; windows and using a mouse to organize them" isn't the best solution. This process is typically slow, and the context-switching between different kinds of work is very unproductive (especially if you end up redoing the same setup afresh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are other ways of managing multi-tasking, like using simple &lt;em&gt;bg&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;fg&lt;/em&gt; commands or using GNU &lt;em&gt;screen&lt;/em&gt;. However, Tmux is considered to be the next evolutionary step forward. I am not overstating; the screen packages have been &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4136481"&gt;replaced by tmux in RHEL8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"T"erminal "mu"ltiple"x"ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing this in github-managed .md file from vim running in a pane, inside a window, in a session managed by a tmux server, through a client running in my zsh terminal from Ubuntu VM using VirtualBox that installed in win10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tmux is a powerful tool; It is one of those things that at first sounds peculiar, involved and intensive; you can't quite grasp what the heck they do, how they can be valuable or why anybody even wants to use them. Nonetheless, it is actually one of those things that will turn out to be a fantastic swiss-army-knife when given a chance. Let's give a chance for the below reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Tmux?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tmux help solves the weaknesses of standard terminal emulators. The followings are some of the reasons why I became a tmux fan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It expedites the creation and management of terminal windows and pane

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you get familiarized with working within sessions, windows, panes, you are into an excellent developer environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides the ability to connect to existing local and remote sessions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses a client-server model, which lets you pause and resume your work where everything is precisely how you left it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes it easy for context-switching between multiple themes of your work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is totally customizable and gives the ability to automate creating a specific layout

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes with the heavy load of built-in commands that let you build your own script to automate your dev env&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides 100% mouse-free control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it can be an incredible productivity booster once you get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basics
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, Lets' break down tmux by its objects, from servers down to panes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Server&lt;/strong&gt; is what powering tmux behind the scenes. It is so streamlined, and zero-config needed from you. It runs in the background; you will hardly notice it is there. When you execute a tmux command, a tmux server is launched. Every activity that is launched in the tmux happen within the server. What you see in your shell is merely a client connection. The server holds sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Session&lt;/strong&gt; is essentially the base unit holding windows. You can have multiple sessions also. e.g., you could have one session for each application your developing or a session for work and a session for your cool side project/exploration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Window&lt;/strong&gt; is what you see when tmux is open in front of you. Think of it as a tab in your browser. The window layout is customizable, and tmux has many preset layouts also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Panes&lt;/strong&gt; are a terminal in a terminal, or you could call it pseudoterminals. The panes let you divide the screen horizontally and vertically within the same window. A window and a pane are perfect analogies to their real-world counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vUPN4e_x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/69mupucxk4ec0l0py5cr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vUPN4e_x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/69mupucxk4ec0l0py5cr.png" alt="session.window.pane"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session, Window, Pane: These are good for logically organizing multiple activities. You can resize /reorg your layout in any way you want in mouse-free style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we got the basic concepts covered. Now, Let's see the general usage of the tool in the context of typical dev workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#typical-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Typical Workflow
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flow is how tmux-using developers' day looks like. First things first, one grabs a coffee ☕ and bossily command GoogleHome to play &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7kCQHbrTpu7lzm22uGMKMG?si=caab7dc2fd454728"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; 🎵 on Spotify. Then, let's say that we are starting the work on project A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; You can start just by invoking

&lt;code&gt;$ tmux&lt;/code&gt;

. However, I suggest that you always begin by creating a session with a name; it is better than a default session name. The name could be the project or a theme you are working on, so it will be easy to recognize and switch between them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ tmux                 # Launch tmux with defalut session    
 $ tmux new-session –s  # Launch tmux with a named session
*[prefix] X            Closing Session

* this is a custom key-binding
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, You can create as many panes as needed (typically, the most user go with three panes in a window; one editor in the main terminal and two other terminals for running processes like interacting with git, running tests, a web server, etc.…)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#### Pane Management
*[prefix] _            Split the window into two vertical panes
*[prefix] |            Split the window into two horizontal panes (horizontal )

 [prefix] q            Show the pane number in each pane briefly.
 [prefix] arrow-keys   Switch focus to different pane
 C-d                   Close the pane just like how you will close a terminal

#### Layout Management
[prefix] &amp;lt;space&amp;gt; Rotate through the default layouts
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;1  Switch to Even Horizontal Layout
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;2  Switch to Even Vertical Layout
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;3  Switch to Main Vertical Layout
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;4  Switch to Main Horizontal Layout
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;5  Switch to Tiled Layout

### Resizing Panes
[prefix] z             zoom current pane to full window size

[prefix] &amp;lt;ctrl&amp;gt;up      increase the height of this pane by one row
[prefix] &amp;lt;ctrl&amp;gt;down    decrease the height of this pane by one row
[prefix] &amp;lt;ctrl&amp;gt;left    increase the width of this pane by one column
[prefix] &amp;lt;ctrl&amp;gt;right   decrease the width of this pane by one column

*[prefix] H             increase the height of this pane by two row (shift+)
*[prefix] J             decrease the height of this pane by one row
*[prefix] K             increase the width of this pane by one column
*[prefix] L             decrease the width of this pane by one column

[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;up       increase the height of this pane by five rows
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;down     decrease the height of this pane by five rows
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;left     increase the width of this pane by five columns
[prefix] &amp;lt;alt&amp;gt;right    decrease the width of this pane by five columns

*this is a custom key-binding
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Then, You start working, click-clack clickity-clack; while you at it, if a single window can't hold all related terminal works, you can create additional windows as you see fit.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Frequent Use:
 [prefix] c      _C_reate a new window
 [prefix] ,      Rename current window

 [prefix] w      Choose a _w_indow from a menu
 [prefix] 0-9    Switch to window 0-9
 [prefix] p      Cycle to _p_revious window
 [prefix] n      Cycle to _n_ext window
 [prefix] l      Back to the _l_ast window

 [prefix] x      Closing Window

Sporadic Use:
 [prefix] M-p    _p_revious window with activity
 [prefix] M-n    _n_ext window with activity

 [prefix] !      Breaking Window Panes If you have too many panes in a single window.

 $ move-window  –t {target session}         # Move the window from one session to another
 $ link-window –t {target session}          # Link a window between two sessions         
 $ unlink-window                            # Unlink the window from the current session
 $ join-pane -t {session}:{window}          # Join the current pane to a target window
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Then, you just realized that you need to finish off something for project B; now, you can create a new session for project B and switch out from the first session. You can come back to project A workspace later (maybe tomorrow or next year as long as your tmux server runs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click here to see useful session management commands and keys...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[prefix] s      Choose from a list of _s_essions
[prefix] (      Switch to previous session
[prefix] )      Switch to next session
[prefix] L      Switch the attached client back to the _L_ast session.
[prefix] $      Rename the session
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; When it is closing time, you could leave the &lt;strong&gt;working session&lt;/strong&gt; open or detach the session. When you detach a session, it becomes a headless entity running in the background and remain active in the server, ready for whenever you want to resume the work. You can even close the terminal that launched it.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt; [prefix] d      _d_etach from your current session
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt; The next day, when you reconnect, you can start a new terminal and reattach the still-running background session that contains your work in progress. Tada! You just jumped right back in. Now, you can start making your keyboard sing again.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ tmux attach-session -t {session-name}   # Start tmux and attach a _t_arget session by name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Beyond Basics: Personalizing Environments &amp;amp; Scripting tmux
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the basics under our belt, let's explore a custom configuration and automation of developer workspace in part 2 of this blog. It will wrap up with a whirlwind of valuable tricks you can use with tmux to improve day to day development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tmux is a versatile addition to your terminal toolbelt. You don't need to grasp everything in a single sitting; efficiently managing workspace with tmux is a skill acquired over a period. Soon you will find yourself becoming more comfortable with this powerful screen-management tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;à suivre...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cloud Native CI/CD with Tekton - Building Custom Tasks</title>
      <author>Martin Heinz</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:48:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/martinheinz/cloud-native-ci-cd-with-tekton-building-custom-tasks-14am</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/martinheinz/cloud-native-ci-cd-with-tekton-building-custom-tasks-14am</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we will pick up where we left off in the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/martinheinz/cloud-native-ci-cd-with-tekton-laying-the-foundation-13n4"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; in which we deployed our Tekton Pipelines environment and we will explore in detail how to find, build and customize Tekton Tasks to create all the necessary building blocks for our pipelines. On top of that, we will also look at how to maintain and test our newly built Tasks, while using all the best practices for creating reusable, testable, well-structured and simple tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't do so yet, then go checkout the previous article to get your Tekton development environment up and running, so you can follow along with the examples in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All the the code and resources used in this article are available in &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tekton-kickstarter&lt;/code&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-tasks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Are Tasks?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tekton &lt;em&gt;Tasks&lt;/em&gt; are the basic building blocks of Pipelines. Task is a sequence of steps that performs some particular, well... task. Each of the steps in a Task is a container inside Task's Pod. Isolating this kind of sequence for related steps into single reusable Task provides Tekton with a lot of versatility and flexibility. They can be as simple as running single &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; command or as complex as Docker build followed push to registry finished by image digest output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Tasks, &lt;em&gt;ClusterTasks&lt;/em&gt; are also available. They're not much different from basic Tasks as they're just a cluster-scoped Tasks. These are useful for general purpose Tasks that perform basic operations such as cloning repository or running &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; commands. Using ClusterTasks helps avoid duplication of code and helps with reusability. Be mindful of modifications to ClusterTasks though, as any changes to them might impact many other pipelines in all the other namespaces in your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we want to execute a Task or ClusterTask we create &lt;em&gt;TaskRun&lt;/em&gt;. In programming terms you could also think of a Task as a class and TaskRun as it's instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the above explanation isn't clear enough, then little example might help. Here's the simplest possible Task we can create:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# echo.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tekton.dev/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ubuntu&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;echo 'Hello world!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This simple Task called &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; really does just that - it runs a &lt;code&gt;ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; container and inject script into it that executes &lt;code&gt;echo 'Hello world!'&lt;/code&gt;. Now that we have a task, we can also run it, or in other words create TaskRun. We can create a YAML file for that and apply it or we can also use &lt;code&gt;tkn&lt;/code&gt; CLI:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tkn task start &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--filename&lt;/span&gt; echo.yaml 
TaskRun started: echo-run-jqn9l

In order to track the TaskRun progress run:
tkn taskrun logs echo-run-jqn9l &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; default

~ &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tkn taskrun logs echo-run-jqn9l &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; default
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;hello] + &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo &lt;/span&gt;Hello world!
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;hello] Hello world!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it's simple as that! We've run our first Task, so let's now move onto something a bit more useful and explore what Tasks are already out there...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-reinvent-a-wheel"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't Reinvent a Wheel
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is about creating and customizing Tekton Tasks, but let's not try to reinvent a wheel here. Instead let's use what Tekton community already created. The main source for existing Tasks that are ready to be used is &lt;em&gt;Tekton Catalog&lt;/em&gt;. It's a repository of reliable, curated Tasks reviewed by Tekton maintainers. In addition to Tekton Catalog repository you can also use &lt;a href="https://hub.tekton.dev/"&gt;Tekton Hub&lt;/a&gt; which lists all the same Tasks as the catalog but in a bit easier to navigate view. It also lists rating of each Task, which might be a helpful indicator of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this catalog, you should be able to find all the basic stuff like Tasks for fetching repository (&lt;code&gt;git-clone&lt;/code&gt;), building and pushing Docker images (&lt;code&gt;kaniko&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;buildah&lt;/code&gt;) or sending Slack notifications (&lt;code&gt;send-to-webhook-slack&lt;/code&gt;). So, before you decide to build custom Tasks try checking the catalog for existing solutions to common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you browsed through the Tekton catalog or Tekton hub, you probably noticed that installation of each Task is just a single &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f ...&lt;/code&gt;. That's easy enough but if you rely on many of these Tasks and want to track them in version control without copy-pasting all of their YAMLs, then you can use convenient script in &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tekton-kickstarter&lt;/code&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt; which will take list of remote YAML URLs, such as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# catalog.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;git-clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/task/git-clone/0.2/git-clone.yaml'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;send-to-webhook-slack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/task/send-to-webhook-slack/0.1/send-to-webhook-slack.yaml'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;skopeo-copy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/task/skopeo-copy/0.1/skopeo-copy.yaml'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;buildid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/task/generate-build-id/0.1/generate-build-id.yaml'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And with invocation of &lt;code&gt;make catalog&lt;/code&gt;, apply them to your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#layout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Layout
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start making custom tasks, it's a good idea to decide on layout which would make them easy to navigate, test and deploy. We can take a bit of an inspiration from Tekton Catalog repository and use the following directory structure:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
├── tasks                      - Custom or remotely retrieved Tasks and ClusterTasks
│   ├── catalog.yaml           - List of Tasks retrieved from remote registries (e.g. Tekton catalog)
│   └── task-name              - Some custom Task
|     ├── task-name.yaml       - File containing Task or ClusterTask
|     └── tests                - Directory with files for testing
|         ├── resources.yaml   - Resources required for testing, e.g. PVC, Deployment
|         └── run.yaml         - TaskRun(s) that performs the test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We store all the tasks in single directory called &lt;code&gt;tasks&lt;/code&gt;. In there we create one directory for each Task, which will contain one YAML file containing the Task itself and one more directory (&lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt;) with resources required for testing. Those would be TaskRun(s) in &lt;code&gt;run.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and any additional resources needed to perform the test inside &lt;code&gt;resources.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. Those could be - for example - PVC for Task performing DB backup or Deployment for task that performs application scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more file shown in the structure above which we mentioned already in previous section is the &lt;code&gt;catalog.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, which holds list of task that are to be installed from remote sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For convenience (if using &lt;code&gt;tekton-kickstarter&lt;/code&gt;) all of these can be installed with one command, which is &lt;code&gt;make deploy-tasks&lt;/code&gt; which traverses &lt;code&gt;tasks&lt;/code&gt; directory and applies all the Tasks to your cluster while omitting all the testing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-custom-ones"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building Custom Ones
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't find appropriate Task for the the job in the catalog, then it's time to write your own. In the beginning of the article I showed very simple "Hello world." example, but Tekton Tasks can get much more complex, so let's go over all the configuration options and features that we can leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start simple and introduce the basics that we will need in pretty much any Task that we build. Those are Task parameters and scripts for Task steps:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/deploy/deploy.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tekton.dev/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ClusterTask&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Deployment name.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;rollout&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;bitnami/kubectl:1.20.2'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;set -xe&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;kubectl rollout restart deployment/$(params.name) -n $(params.namespace)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the above &lt;code&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; Task we can perform simple rollout of Kubernetes Deployment, by supplying it with name of the Deployment in &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter and optionally &lt;code&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt; in which it resides. These parameters that we pass to the Task are then used in &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; section where they're expanded before the script is executed. To tell Tekton to expand the parameter we use the &lt;code&gt;$(params.name)&lt;/code&gt; notation. This can be also used in other parts of spec, not just in the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's take a closer look at the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; section - we begin it with &lt;em&gt;shebang&lt;/em&gt; to make sure that we will be using &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;. However, that doesn't mean that you always have to use &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, same way you could use for example Python with &lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/code&gt;, it all depend on your preference and on what's available in the image being used. After shebang we also use &lt;code&gt;set -xe&lt;/code&gt; which tells the script to echo each command being executed - you don't have to do this, but it can be very helpful during debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you don't need whole script, but just a single command, then you can replace &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; section with &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt;. This is how it would like like for simple Task that performs application health check using &lt;code&gt;kubectl wait&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;note: omitting obvious/non-relevant parts of Task body for remaining examples&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/healthcheck/healthcheck.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;bitnami/kubectl:1.20.2'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kubectl&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;--for=condition=available&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;--timeout=600s&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;deployment/$(params.name)&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$(params.namespace)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This works the same way as with &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; directive in pods and so it can get verbose and hard to read if you have many arguments as in the example above. For this reason I prefer to use &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; for almost everything, as it's more readable and easier to update/change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common thing that you might need in your Tasks is some kind of a storage where you can write data that can be used by subsequent steps in the Task or by other Tasks in the pipeline. The most common use case for this would be a place to &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/master/task/git-clone/0.2"&gt;fetch git repo&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of a storage is called &lt;code&gt;workspace&lt;/code&gt; in Tekton and the following example shows a Tasks that mounts and clears the storage using &lt;code&gt;rmdir&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/clean/clean.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Path to directory being deleted.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;.'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;workspaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;mountPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/workspace&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ubuntu&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;rmdir&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;set -xe&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;rm -rf "$(workspaces.source.path)/$(params.path)"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Above &lt;code&gt;clean&lt;/code&gt; Task includes &lt;code&gt;workspace&lt;/code&gt; section that defines name of the workspace and path where it should be mounted. To make it easier to update the &lt;code&gt;mountPath&lt;/code&gt;, Tekton provides variable in a format &lt;code&gt;$(workspaces.ws-name.path)&lt;/code&gt; which can be used in scripts to reference the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, defining the workspace is pretty simple, but the disk backing the workspace won't appear out of thin air. Therefore, when we execute Task that asks for a workspace, we also need to create PVC for it. The TaskRun with creation of needed PVC for the above Task would look like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/clean/tests/run.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tekton.dev/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;TaskRun&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;clean&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;somedir'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;taskRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;clean&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Reference to the task&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ClusterTask&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# In case of ClusterTask we need to explicitly specify `kind`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;workspaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumeClaimTemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# PVC created this way will be cleaned-up after TaskRun/PipelineRun completes!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;accessModes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ReadWriteOnce&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;1Gi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Workspaces are very generic and therefore can be also used not just to store some ephemeral data during Task/Pipeline run, but also as a long term storage like in the following example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/pg-dump/pg-dump.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tekton.dev/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ClusterTask&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pg-dump&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;DATABASE&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;DEST&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;workspaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;backup&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;mountPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/backup&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pg-dump&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres:13.2-alpine'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;valueFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;secretKeyRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres-config&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;POSTGRES_USER&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;valueFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;secretKeyRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres-config&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;POSTGRES_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env sh&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;set -xe&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;PGPASSWORD="$PASSWORD" pg_dump -h $(params.HOST) -Fc -U $USERNAME $(params.DATABASE) &amp;gt; $(workspaces.backup.path)/$(params.DEST)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This Task can perform a PostgreSQL database backup using &lt;code&gt;pg_dump&lt;/code&gt; utility. In this example, the script grabs the database data from host and DB specified in parameters and streams it into workspaces which is backed by PVC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature that I sneaked into this example that you will encounter quite often is ability to inject environment variables from &lt;em&gt;ConfigMaps&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Secrets&lt;/em&gt;. This is done in &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; section. This works exactly the same way as with Pods, so you can refer to that part of an API for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the main topic of this example - PVC for database backup - considering that we want this data to be persistent, we cannot use PVC created using &lt;code&gt;volumeClaimTemplate&lt;/code&gt; as shown previously as that would get cleaned up after Task finishes, so instead we need to create the PVC separately and pass it to Task this way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/tree/master/tasks/pg-dump/tests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;PersistentVolumeClaim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres-backup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;1Gi&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumeMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Filesystem&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;accessModes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ReadWriteOnce&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nn"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tekton.dev/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;TaskRun&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pg-dump&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;taskRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;pg-dump&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ClusterTask&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres.default.svc.cluster.local'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;DATABASE&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;DEST&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;test.bak'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;workspaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;backup&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;persistentVolumeClaim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;claimName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;postgres-backup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we use &lt;code&gt;persistentVolumeClaim&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;volumeClaimTemplate&lt;/code&gt; and we specify name of existing PVC which is also defined in the above snippet. This example also assumes that there's a PostgreSQL database running at specified host - for full code including PostgreSQL deployment checkout files &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/tree/master/tasks/pg-dump/tests"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly to injection of environment variables, we can also use workspaces to inject whole ConfigMaps or Secrets (or some keys in them) as a file. This can be useful for example when you want whole &lt;code&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt; certificate from Secret in the Task or as a config file that maps GitHub repository to application name as in following example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/misc/config.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ConfigMap&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;repo-app-mapping&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s"&gt;repo-app-mapping.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;repository-url&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mapping-file&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;get-application-name&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mikefarah/yq&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env sh&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;set -xe&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;yq e '."$(params.repository-url)"' /config/$(params.mapping-file) | tr -d '\012\015' &amp;gt; /tekton/results/application-name&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;application-name&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Can be accessed by other Tasks with $(tasks.get-application-name.results.application-name)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;workspaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;mountPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This Task takes repository URL and uses it to look up matching application name in the file which is part of the above shown ConfigMap. This is done using &lt;code&gt;yq&lt;/code&gt; utility followed by output to a file in special directory called &lt;code&gt;/tekton/results/...&lt;/code&gt;. This directory stores &lt;code&gt;results&lt;/code&gt; of Tasks which is a feature (and YAML section) we haven't mentioned yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task results are small pieces of data that Task can output, which then can be used by subsequent Tasks. To use these, one has to specify the name of the result variable in &lt;code&gt;results&lt;/code&gt; section and then write something to &lt;code&gt;/tekton/results/result-var-name&lt;/code&gt;. Also, as you surely noticed in the above script, we strip newline from the result using &lt;code&gt;tr&lt;/code&gt; before writing it into the file, that's because the result should be simple output - ideally just single word - and not a big chunk of text. If you decide to write something longer (with multiple lines) to the result, you might end-up losing part of the value or seeing only empty string if you don't strip the newline character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To then use Task - such as this one - that uses workspace from ConfigMap, we have to specify the config map in &lt;code&gt;workspaces&lt;/code&gt; section in the following way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Full example at https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/get-application-name/tests/run.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;workspaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;configmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;repo-app-mapping&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Final thing I want to show here is the usage of sidecar containers. These are not so common, but can be useful when you need to run some service (which your Task depends on) for the duration of Task execution. One such service can be Docker daemon sidecar with exposed socket. To demonstrate this we can create a Task that performs Docker image efficiency analysis using tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive"&gt;Dive&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/tasks/dive/dive.yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;tekton.dev/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;ClusterTask&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="na"&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;IMAGE&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;Name (reference) of the image to analyze.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;wagoodman/dive:latest'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dive&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;true'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dive&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;$(params.IMAGE)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumeMounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;mountPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/var/run/&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dind-socket&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;sidecars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;docker:18.05-dind'&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;securityContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;privileged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumeMounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;mountPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/var/lib/docker&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dind-storage&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;mountPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;/var/run/&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dind-socket&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dind-storage&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;emptyDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pi"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;dind-socket&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;emptyDir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pi"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pi"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see here, the &lt;code&gt;sidecars&lt;/code&gt; section is pretty much the same as definition of any container in Pod spec. In addition to the usual stuff we've seen in previous examples, here we also specify &lt;code&gt;volumes&lt;/code&gt; which are shared between sidecar and container in Tasks steps - in this case one of them being Docker storage in &lt;code&gt;dind-socket&lt;/code&gt; which Dive container attaches to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This covers most of the features of Tekton Tasks, but one thing I didn't mention so far and you will surely run into when reading Tekton docs is &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/resources.md"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PipelineResource&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object, which can be used as Tasks input or output - for example GitHub sources as input or Docker image as output. So, why haven't I mentioned it yet? Well, PipelineResource is part of Tekton that I prefer to not use for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's still in &lt;em&gt;alpha&lt;/em&gt; unlike all the other resource types we used so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are very few PipelineResources. It's mostly just Git, Pull request and Image resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's hard to troubleshoot them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need more reason not to use them (for now), then take a look at docs section &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/resources.md#why-arent-pipelineresources-in-beta"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these examples that we went over, we've seen a lot of YAML sections, options and features which shows how flexible Tekton is, this however makes it's API spec - naturally - very complex. &lt;code&gt;kubectl explain&lt;/code&gt; unfortunately doesn't help with exploring API, but API spec is available in &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/api-spec.md"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; but is lacking at best. So, in case you have trouble finding what can you put in which part of YAML, then your best bet is to rely on fields listed at the beginning of &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#configuring-a-task"&gt;Tasks doc&lt;/a&gt; or on examples &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/examples/v1beta1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but make sure you're on right branch for your version of Tekton, otherwise you might spend long hours debugging why your seemingly correct Task cannot be validated by Tekton controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-and-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running and Testing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we mostly just talked about Tasks and not much was said about TaskRuns. That's because - in my opinion - individual TaskRuns are best suited for testing and not really for running the Tasks regularly. For that you should use pipelines which will a topic of next article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of testing - when we're done implementing the Task, then it's time to run some tests. For straightforward and easy testing, I recommend using the layout mentioned earlier in the article. Using it should help you encapsulate the Task in a way that allows you to test it independently of any resources outside of it's directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To then perform the actual test it's enough to apply resources/dependencies in &lt;code&gt;.../tests/resources.yaml&lt;/code&gt; (if any) and then apply the actual test(s) inside &lt;code&gt;.../tests/run.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. The tests really are just set of TaskRuns that use your custom Task, so for this basic testing approach there's no need for any setup/teardown or additional scripts - just &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f resources.yaml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f run.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. Examples of simple tests can be found each Task's directory in &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/tree/master/tasks"&gt;tekton-kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; or in Tekton Catalog repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general though, for any particular Task in repositories of both of these projects, you can run the following commands to perform the test:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl apply &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; tests/resources.yaml  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Deploy dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
kubectl apply &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; tests/run.yaml        &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Start tests&lt;/span&gt;
kubectl get &lt;span class="nb"&gt;tr&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# List the TaskRuns (tests)&lt;/span&gt;
NAME           SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
some-taskrun   True        Succeeded   106s        4s

tkn &lt;span class="nb"&gt;tr &lt;/span&gt;logs some-taskrun  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# View logs from TaskRun&lt;/span&gt;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For me personally - when it comes to testing Tasks - it's sufficient to use the above basic testing approach for validation and ad-hoc testing. If you however end-up creating large number of custom Tasks and want to go all out, then you can adopt the approach in Tekton catalog and leverage testing scripts in it's repository. If you decide to go that route and strictly follow the layout and testing, you might also want to try contributing the Tasks to the Tekton Catalog, so that whole community can benefit from more high quality Tasks. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the scripts that you'll need for this - you'll need to include &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/master/test"&gt;&lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; directory&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt; dependencies (&lt;code&gt;vendor&lt;/code&gt; directory) from Tekton Catalog in your code and then follow E2E testing guide in docs &lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#end-to-end-testing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you choose basic or "all-out" approach for your testing though, try to make sure that you test more than just happy paths in the Tasks and Pipelines, otherwise you might end-up seeing a lot of bugs when they get deployed &lt;em&gt;"in the wild"&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#best-practices"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Best Practices
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have implemented and tested your custom Tasks, it's a good idea to go back and make sure your Tasks are following the best development practices, which will make them more reusable and maintainable in a long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest thing that you can do that will also give the most benefit - is to use &lt;code&gt;yamllint&lt;/code&gt; - a linter for YAML files. This tip doesn't apply only to Tekton Tasks, but rather to all YAML files as they can get tricky to get right with all the indentation, but it's especially important with Task definitions can get very long and complex, with many levels of indentation, so keeping them readable and validated can save you some unnecessary debugging as well as help you in keeping them more maintainable. You can find a custom &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter/blob/master/.yamllint"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.yamlint&lt;/code&gt; config&lt;/a&gt; in my repository which I like to use, but you should customize it to suit your code style and formatting. Just make sure you run &lt;code&gt;yamllint&lt;/code&gt; from time to time (ideally in CI/CD) to keep things linted and validated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the actual Tekton best practices - I could give you a huge list, but it would be mostly just things recommended by Tekton maintainers, so instead of copy-pasting it here, I will just point you to the relevant resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/master/recommendations.md"&gt;Task Authoring Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/design-principles.md"&gt;Tekton Design Principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines"&gt;Tekton Contributing Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we saw how flexible and versatile Tekton is and with this flexibility also comes complexity of building or testing Tasks. Therefore, it's very much preferable to use existing Tasks created by community, rather then try to reinvent a wheel yourself. If there's however no suitable Task available and you have to build your own, make sure you write tests for your Tasks and follow best practices mentioned above to keep your Tasks maintainable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this article we should have enough experience as well as bunch of individual custom Tasks which we can use to start composing our pipelines. And that's exactly what we're going to do in the next article in these series, where we will explore how to build fully-featured pipelines to build, deploy, test your applications and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you haven't done so yet, make sure you checkout &lt;a href="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/tekton-kickstarter"&gt;tekton-kickstarter repository&lt;/a&gt; where you can find all the Tasks and examples from this article as well as the pipelines you will see in the next one. 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Code tutorials and where to find them.</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jarvisscript/free-code-tutorials-and-where-to-find-them-591l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's April and one of the code sites is offering free use of it's content for the month. So I decided to make a list of some of the free code tutorial sites. This is not a full list but just some of the places I've used to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/"&gt;Plurasight&lt;/a&gt; is free for the month. Why free? to get people to use their site and hopefully sign up for subscriptions. There is some great content here. This week I'm learning React by building a game. Earlier I watched some Accessibility videos. It didn't have hands on on exercises but the videos are good references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out #freeApril, while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; has a free tier and a PRO tier. I have used Codecademy several times in my software journey. Most recently for React lessons. It's good to use different sources to learn. The different views points might fill in gaps others left or explain something in a way that "clicks" better with you. &lt;br&gt;
Codecademy has nice interactive lessons that helps debug you code. You can set your own goals and earn badges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wesbos.com/courses/"&gt;Wes Bos&lt;/a&gt; also has free and paid courses. His free courses cover JavaScript, CSS, and markdown. JavaScript30 is a 30 day challenge of vanilla JavaScript. Mastering Markdown is a good primer for using markdown. I picked up a few tips for it for this blog. He has Grid and Flexbox lessons as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; is always free. I built some python games using their videos. But those were videos FreeCodeCamp Shared on YouTube. I have not used their full certification site. I just wanted to build something and a duckduckgo search sent me to YouTube. Which leads us to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; There's some great content on here as well. Many developers have their own channels. So search and see who you can find. It's not interactive like some of the other tutorials but there are videos where you can code along and build what they build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's my quick list of free tutorial sites. Use different sites to get different looks at a language. After you build a few things test your knowledge on some code challenge sites. Which sounds like a good topic for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
