      <description>&lt;p&gt;General rules in Russia The Russian government has not taken a firm stand on digital currencies. Even Russian politicians have issued statements imposing a total ban on these currencies, which were later denied. On March 7, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin called to clarify the legal status of digital currencies in the country as soon as possible. Following this order, the bill was introduced and drafted by the government. However, its acceptance has not been officially announced yet. The bill welcomes the sale and purchase of digital currency in reputable exchange offices. It considers digital currency tools as digital financial assets traded only in the context of authorized exchange offices. Also, according to the bill, users of digital currency exchanges are required to comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations related to counterterrorism. The purpose of the published document was to minimize the risks in digital currencies and prevent using these currencies as much as possible for criminal activities.&lt;br&gt;
 In 2017, several rumours about developing a national digital currency in Russia called "crypto ruble." Still, the Russian authorities later denied it, and the country currently has no official digital currency.&lt;br&gt;
On May 24, 2018, the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation (Sberbank) and the Central Bank of Russia announced their plans to implement a pilot ICO. On November 2, 2018, the chairman of the Russian State Committee on Financial Markets announced that it intends to launch a state-owned digital currency backed by the Russian ruble. Russia's Ministry of Economic (MinFin) believes that creating a digital currency backed by the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will be inevitable due to US sanctions. One of the major Russian news media outlets, Rambler, reflected the views of the Russian Ministry of Economy on December 21, 2018. Russia's Deputy Economy Minister Alexei Moysev said that at the discretion of the Russian Ministry of Economy, there is an excellent opportunity by 2020 or 2021 to launch a digital currency supported by the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The Eurasian Union was founded in 2014 and had five members: Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. In Russia, the extraction of digital currencies is not prohibited under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## The timing of digital currency legislation in Russia&lt;br&gt;
 In 2017 has prompted a flurry of news about the development of a national digital currency in Russia called the crypto-ruble but was later denied by Russian officials, who currently have no official digital currency. On March 7, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin called to clarify the legal status of digital currencies in the country as soon as possible. Following this order, the bill was introduced and drafted by the government. However, its acceptance has not been officially announced yet. On May 24, 2018, the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation (Sberbank) and the Central Bank of Russia announced their plans to implement a pilot ICO. On November 2, 2018, the chairman of the Russian State Committee on Financial Markets announced that it intends to launch a state-owned digital currency backed by the Russian ruble. On December 21, 2018, Russian Deputy Minister of Economy Alexei Movisyev stated that at the discretion of the Russian Ministry of Economy, there is an excellent opportunity by 2020 or 2021 to launch a digital currency supported by the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XCJdEgwB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rpfkyjs1lr2wf1mdscv.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XCJdEgwB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1rpfkyjs1lr2wf1mdscv.jpg" alt="crypto regulation in russia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#definition-and-approach-of-the-government"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Definition and approach of the government
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is one of the countries with no clear and direct rules on digital currencies and their use. However, Chinese officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to use the Chinese bloc and even the supply of particular currency by the Chinese government. There are no unified rules for the Chinese bloc. The decision-making body in the field of financial systems in Russia is the Ministry of Economy. For several years now, the attention of this authority has been drawn to digital currencies, but so far, no serious decision has been made to legislate these currencies in Russia. Russia's central bank has warned of the dangers of digital currency exchanges and their links to fraud and money laundering. Many draft bills have also been prepared by the Duma, which is still awaiting approval. Therefore, it can be said that there is not much transparency in the legal aspects of digital currencies in Russia. The Russian government refers to digital currencies as "digital currencies" and is seriously pursuing legislation in ICOs, tokens, blockchain, and digital currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sales-rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sales rules
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Russian law, digital assets can only be exchanged for common currencies (rubles or other countries' currencies). To supply the tokens, the distributor must submit the necessary forms to the judicial authorities; Relevant documents must also be made available to the public upon completion of the tokens. The project's WhitePaper will also be made available to the public and legislators for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tax-collection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tax collection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no specific laws regarding the taxation of digital currencies in Russia, but the Russian government applies general tax laws. The tax will also be based on the value of digital currencies in Russian rubles and include income tax. The payer is also required to submit a statement of income to the relevant authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MFd56E6C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jznim5owuftcfirk89fs.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MFd56E6C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jznim5owuftcfirk89fs.jpg" alt="cryptocurrency tax legislation in russia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#antimoney-laundering-laws"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Anti-money laundering laws
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian government has previously warned its citizens against using digital currencies in money laundering. However, there are no laws for money laundering with digital currencies in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#use-and-advertisement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use and advertisement
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we have seen several pilot programs by the Russian government in digital currencies and the development of blockchain technology in China. On the other hand, the government is closely monitoring the digital currency market. In 2015, we witnessed creating a particular working group by the Russian government to study China's blockchain technology aspects. In 2016, Qiwi, an electronic payment service provider, CIS and several private banks in Russia, worked with Chinese central banks on Chinese blockchain projects. Also, in 2017, the President of Russia ordered the government and the Central Bank of Russia, by creating the necessary legal mechanism and framework, to create space for the use of economic innovations based on the Chinese bloc. Plans have been put forward to apply China Blockchain technology in real estate, verification information and payment data.&lt;br&gt;
Maintain and obtain the necessary permits&lt;br&gt;
The draft bill submitted to the Russian parliament sets out specific rules for holding digital currencies. According to the bill, the maintenance of digital currencies is not limited and is based on user access to capital. Accordingly, a decentralized system must meet the following conditions: a) Verify that the individual and only the individual can access specific codes or assets. B) Make it possible for a person to access his information at any time and place. The bill also included a section entitled "Investment Platform." This section states An information system in the context of the Internet that uses information technology and technical capabilities to attract investors. Only institutions under the supervision of the Central Bank of Russia can create such platforms. This law restricts investors who have not obtained the necessary approvals; These restrictions are enacted under the Securities Act. The determining body will be in the competence of investors of the Central Bank of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mining"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mining
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is referred to in the draft law as "ex-digital verification." According to this law, an extraction is an act in which records are digitally verified to obtain digital currencies as a reward. This digital verification must be following the rules of digital transactions. Mining activities will also include tax collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overseas-restrictions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overseas restrictions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently no such restrictions in Russia.&lt;br&gt;
The need for reporting&lt;br&gt;
There is currently no need to report digital currency assets in Russia. Asset reporting laws are in place to combat money laundering and are based on money laundering laws. Still, it is not yet clear whether digital currencies are recognized as assets by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favorite Free SQL Courses for Beginners</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/javinpaul/my-favorite-free-sql-courses-for-beginners-2d3j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: This post includes affiliate links; I may receive compensation if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello folks, if you want to learn SQL and Database fundamentals or want to improve your SQL skills, and looking for free resources like books and online courses then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I am going to share my favorite free online courses to learn SQL from Udemy, Coursera, Pluralsight, and other popular online learning websites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to become a &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/01/10-tips-to-improve-programming-skill-become-better-programmer.html"&gt;better programmer&lt;/a&gt;, or better developer then learning SQL is really important as its one of the key skills for any programmer or software developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list includes free SQL course from Udemy, a popular online portal to learn popular database like &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/6-best-pl-sql-and-oracle-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online-effd07d5fd2"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-free-postgresql-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-in-2021-3bf369d73794"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-courses-to-learn-microsoft-sql-server-in-depth-e9f11b73c14a"&gt;Microsoft SQL Server&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have tried hard to include free courses on different databases so that you can choose the right course for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you already know, SQL is one of the essential and timeless skills and much more important than any fancy library or framework you are thinking to learn. If you ask me which two skills every programmer should have, I would say &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html"&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/02/5-courses-to-learn-shell-scripting-in-linux.html"&gt;UNIX&lt;/a&gt;; these two have survived for a long time and will survive for many coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL is also exciting; once you get the hang of it, you would love to write queries and analyze your queries' performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though SQL is so important and many programmers realize this, I have found that many more programmers just don't spend much time improving their SQL skills. They think that knowing just &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/10/selct-command-sql-query-example.html#axzz6pRY6p3if"&gt;SELECT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/01/jdbc-batch-insert-and-update-example-java-prepared-statement.html"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-to-use-truncate-and-delete-command.html"&gt;DELETE&lt;/a&gt; statements is enough, which is not correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though SQL is not as vast as &lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-cpp-courses-to-learn-programming.html"&gt;C++&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/08/top-10-free-java-courses-for-beginners-experienced-developers.html"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, there are still many things to learn like indexing, choosing the right index, writing a correct query that performs better, and there are always many database-specific nuisances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that may work in one data like &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-oracle-and-microsoft-sql-server-online-courses.html"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; it's not guaranteed to work on another database, especially if you are using a database-specific feature and not limited to SQL ANSI standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you don't need to worry; if you have made a goal to learn SQL or improve your SQL skill, you will definitely spend some time learning more about SQL and the database you are currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take help from these &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html"&gt;courses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-books-to-learn-sql-and-database-design-for-programmers-and-developers-1e7839df2f3e"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, and several tutorials I have shared in this blog to fill the gaps in your understanding. Btw, I also recommend everyone to join a comprehensive SQL beginner course for structured learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-best-free-online-courses-to-learn-sql-in-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8 Best Free Online Courses to Learn SQL in 2021
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These courses have been made free by their instructor for promotional and education reasons, but you better check the price before joining the course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Instructors convert their free course to the paid course once they reach their promotional target, and you may need to pay to access the material available for free earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I join the course when they are free and use it when I get some time to spend. Once you join, the course will be free for you. Without any further ado, here is my list of some of the best yet free courses to learn SQL and Database from scratch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-introduction-to-databases-and-sql-querying"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;amp;type=10&amp;amp;tmpid=14538&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fintroduction-to-databases-and-sql-querying%2F"&gt;Introduction to Databases and SQL Querying &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an introductory course on Databases and SQL Querying. There are no pre-requisites for this course. If you are looking to get acquainted with the concept of Databases and Queries for maybe your next interview as an analyst, this is the right course for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is a windows machine, and we will walk through it step by step, right from setting up your environment to creating your first table to writing your first SQL query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is structured in a way that you can follow along with me. At the end of this course, you should be comfortable writing simple queries, including queries related to &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/10/how-to-compare-date-in-sql-server-query.html"&gt;Dates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/charindex-padindex-sybase-sqlserver-eample-split-string-stored-procedure.html"&gt;String manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/04/sql-group-by-and-having-example-write.html"&gt;Aggregation&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an ideal course for SQL beginners with absolutely no experience in the database. You will not only learn basic SQL Syntax but also learn essential concepts of databases. No Prior Programming experience is required. This course is probably not for you if you're looking to learn more advanced and complex queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;amp;type=10&amp;amp;tmpid=14538&amp;amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fintroduction-to-databases-and-sql-querying%2F"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vMV-N8jE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BN2B8CrFDDc/Xlh9tqnPlSI/AAAAAAAAdNQ/8s8rudHUv7whAQ6a7adwZ1pjaNDnwB4tgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/LEFT%252Bvs%252BRight%252BOuter%252BJoin%252Bin%252BSQL.png" alt="Introduction to Databases and SQL Querying - free course"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another free online course to learn SQL basics, but with PostgreSQL, another leading relational database. This free Udemy SQL course is also aimed at Beginners to Intermediate levels. It covers all the bases for you to get up to speed with writing SQL before you progress on to more advanced SQL for transforming and analyzing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will explain everything step by step and in detail to get to know SQL very well. The course uses &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-courses-to-learn-postgresql-in.html"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, which you can download for free from the PostgreSQL website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are key things you will learn in this free SQL course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Basic SQL commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Become proficient in SQL queries like SELECT, CREATE, and ALTER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Solid understanding of SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing this course, you should understand write join queries involving multiple tables, write aggregation-based queries using &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/08/difference-between-where-vs-having-clause-SQL-databse-group-by-comparision.html"&gt;group by&lt;/a&gt; and having a clause, and learn how to do backups and restores. You will also learn more advanced SQL query techniques for data analysis and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another awesome course to learn SQL Fundamentals for Data Scientists. This is one of the most popular SQL course on Coursera  and more than 350K people have joined this course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also part of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Flearn-sql-basics-data-science"&gt;Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization&lt;/a&gt; which is offered by UCDavis, University of California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is designed for beginners and will teach you fundamentals of SQL and working with data so that you can begin analyzing it for data science purposes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about this course is that it starts with the basics and assumes you do not have any knowledge or skills in SQL.

&lt;p&gt;It will build on that foundation and gradually have you write both simple and complex queries to help you select data from tables.  You'll start to work with different types of data like strings and numbers and discuss methods to filter and pare down your results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fsql-for-data-science"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GtGc8MKs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t8pn8mrd84k6rirplk3x.jpeg" alt="XDP~SPECIALIZATION!~learn-sql-basics-data-science"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 general 🚀 Productivity 🚀 tools  you should be using that you possibly haven't heard of ⁉</title>
      <author>InHuOfficial</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 05:29:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/3-general-productivity-tools-you-should-be-using-that-you-possibly-haven-t-heard-of-1h9j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/inhuofficial/3-general-productivity-tools-you-should-be-using-that-you-possibly-haven-t-heard-of-1h9j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;3 pieces of software &lt;strong&gt;that I use&lt;/strong&gt; that I am sure a lot of people haven't heard of, but should start using. If you have heard of them, do you use any (all) of them and how do you use them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh and this isn't a tutorial post on how to use them, just what they are and how they benefit me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-cold-turkey"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Cold Turkey.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It blocks stuff. But not just websites, it blocks &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will block websites, applications...and your computer...seriously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it to block certain sites during the day that I know will distract me...boring, loads of people do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use it to block Outlook. Yes I only check my emails 3 times a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No pinging every 5 minutes distracting me, just 3 times where I tackle stuff that needs doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you are thinking this isn't possible due to X, Y and Z...trust me you can persuade people that email is not live chat! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not caused me any issues in the 3 years I have done it. Cold Turkey stops me going back to the ping ping ping days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-best-bit"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The best bit
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But best of all, I use Cold Turkey to block my computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a mode called "Frozen Turkey" that lets you lock yourself out of your computer at certain times of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair warning, if you get this wrong it can really cause headaches! However when you get it right it can be so good for sticking to a routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I wanted to make sure I eat at certain times of the day. So I just lock my computer for 15 minutes each time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I have to be careful that I don't schedule meetings that might run into these times (as you can imagine that would be unprofessional) but I have also become very good at saying no to meetings that don't fit my diary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#managing-work-life-balance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Managing work life balance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also lock my PC at night when I need to. Sometimes I get into bad habits where I am working at 1am due to deadlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work as you then end up producing less the next day anyway (meaning you have to work to 1am again and the cycle continues...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this happens I set a block up for the week, computer off at 10pm, can't access it until 530am. That way I ensure I have at least 7 hours where I CANNOT work...so I might as well sleep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a feature to be used with caution...I did once lock the computer for a day by mistake and had to spend an hour fiddling to undo the lock so I could work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But bar that one slip up (which you learn from!) it has been fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway - you should check it out &lt;a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/"&gt;https://getcoldturkey.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; £29.00 (GBP) now (lifetime usage), not sure whether that price changes based on Country but that is about $40 (USD). &lt;strong&gt;Worth every penny!&lt;/strong&gt; (Mac and Windows)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also offer "micro manager" - which does the same except you whitelist applications for a while and everything else gets blocked - so you can have focus sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also offer "Writer" which blocks everything on your computer, blacks out all the screens (if you have more than one) and provides you with a very simple screen to write on. Oh and this one blocks you for an amount of time &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; an amount of words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't tend to use the micro manager as I have my block list set pretty well but the writer occasionally gets used if I want to just &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing"&gt;free-write&lt;/a&gt; to clear my head / work on an idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again, if I need to focus on writing something I have a different block list for Cold Turkey so I don't need the writer very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-rescue-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Rescue Time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are loads of time tracking applications, this one works best for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it tracks things automatically and with a little bit of work it can provide some really interesting insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a free version...don't bother there are better alternatives. The paid version...that is where the magic is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is subtle, the free version tracks what applications you are using and when, the paid version tracks the applications and &lt;strong&gt;which document you are working on / using&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of manipulation and effort you can use it to tell you exactly how long you have spent on each project each day (they also have project tracking built in but it was a bit simplistic for my liking, it might work for you though!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also lets you categorise time with fine detail. For example visiting dev.to and any page is considered leisure time (the way I have it set up). But if I am on dev.to/new or the URL ends in /edit I mark it as writing time (productive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also added slack integration so you can update your status to show what you are working on automatically (don't worry it wont tell people when you are procrastinating and looking at non work stuff!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is $78 (USD) for a year or $12 (USD) a month...save up and buy the year as it costs almost half as much that way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go check it out as well - &lt;a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/why_premium"&gt;https://www.rescuetime.com/why_premium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
(works on everything, Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-powertoys"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. PowerToys
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I know...it sounds like a website for  industrial strength vibrators (just me? 🤣).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the unfortunate name it is a great piece of kit (for Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a set of utilities that Windows should really just ship with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get a few features but the ones I use are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Colour picker&lt;/strong&gt; - Windows + Shift + C - A colour picker that works across everything and copies the result to the keyboard. It also shows you the current colour under the cursor as you move around as hex and RGB values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Power Toys Run&lt;/strong&gt; - kind of like Mac Spotlight but worse, it lets you quickly access applications, documents etc. with Alt + Space. I use it occasionally but I find it too slow, your mileage may vary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Improved file explorer previews&lt;/strong&gt; - preview SVGs and markdown - handy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fancy Zones&lt;/strong&gt; - ✔ &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is why this is worth downloading. I have 6 screens and 2 of them are massive (not flexing, just to show how hard it is to manage monitors). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0dv-wSeC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/alduc45jcozk6wwid5h1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0dv-wSeC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/alduc45jcozk6wwid5h1.jpg" alt="Home office - one 43 inch monitor horizontal as main, one 43 inch monitor in portrait at the side, two 21 inch monitors above main, 1 21 inch monitor to the left and a laptop to the right of everything. Microphone on moveable arm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to arrange my Windows in certain ways that you just can't do without patience on Windows (such as add 3 applications split horizontally one on top of the other on the right hand screen for monitoring applications etc.)! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fancy zones lets you add zones to your screens where you can drag and drop a window and they will fill that zone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically you can make a window fit into two zones or even 4 zones that are next to each other if you set the zones up correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u-ZAz1fs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhjmsg2otaauy8uafnn9.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u-ZAz1fs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fhjmsg2otaauy8uafnn9.jpg" alt="fancy zones layout on my main monitor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My main monitor "fancy zones" layout. Where 4 zones intersect you can make an application fill all 4 zones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy of just pressing Shift when dragging a window and having it take up exactly a third of the screen vertically, or a third horizontally etc. cannot be over stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is free so even if you can't afford the other two right now you should definitely get this one if you have more than one screen or like to set your application layout a certain way (and use Windows)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it here -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share 3 applications I thought were useful you may not have heard of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you end up using any of them (or already use them and how they help you) in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#little-note-to-people-who-read-my-stuff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Little note to people who read my stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering why I would follow up on my 16,500 word monster post with something so simple and "low effort"...it is a little experiment...more on that in a bit 🤐!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you missed that one and have an hour to kill:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 UX Tips to Become a Better Front End Developer</title>
      <author>Tapajyoti Bose</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 04:42:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/5-ux-tips-to-become-a-better-front-end-developer-46if</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/5-ux-tips-to-become-a-better-front-end-developer-46if</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just on reading the title, you might think &lt;em&gt;Didn't you release an article on the same topic last week?&lt;/em&gt; Let's address that first. Using &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt; interchangeably is a common mistake among many Designers. So, we must differentiate the two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Interface&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;) refers to the space where interactions between humans and a product occur, whereas &lt;strong&gt;User Experience&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt;) is an emotional outcome after interactions with a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eSEnmQgn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5jac7rmdvsfdeh7k8v8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eSEnmQgn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5jac7rmdvsfdeh7k8v8.jpg" alt="UI and UX"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with that out of the way, let's move on to how we can deliver a mind-blowing (🤯) &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-use-a-polished-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Use a Polished &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes without saying, &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt; is an integral part of &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt;. Without a polished &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;, you will never be able to deliver a &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt; worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a good idea to create a &lt;em&gt;wireframe&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;mockup&lt;/em&gt; using some tools like &lt;strong&gt;Figma&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Adobe XD&lt;/strong&gt; before you start developing the actual product as making changes to the &lt;em&gt;wireframe&lt;/em&gt; is much easier than making changes in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-use-microinteractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Use &lt;strong&gt;Micro-interactions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro-interactions&lt;/strong&gt; are one of the key ingredients of &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt;. You might be wondering &lt;em&gt;What are these "&lt;strong&gt;Micro-interaction&lt;/strong&gt;" things?&lt;/em&gt;, well, let me enlighten you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro-interactions&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the small and subtle changes in the &lt;strong&gt;UI&lt;/strong&gt;, triggered by some user action. Such as &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;scroll&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hover&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;strong&gt;Micro-interactions&lt;/strong&gt;, the users will feel as if your site lacks something, even though they will be able to pinpoint the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You need not use some super &lt;em&gt;fancy animations&lt;/em&gt;, only basic ones are good enough (but the &lt;em&gt;fancy animations&lt;/em&gt; does help in keeping the user engaged)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gwaNPUhh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kk9wlsooc1vkfmo1tag.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gwaNPUhh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kk9wlsooc1vkfmo1tag.gif" alt="Scroll Animation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-reduce-the-number-of-actions-to-accomplish-a-task"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Reduce the number of actions to accomplish a task
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day by day, the &lt;strong&gt;attention span&lt;/strong&gt; of humans is reducing to the point that even a goldfish has more &lt;strong&gt;attention span&lt;/strong&gt; than us. The &lt;em&gt;more actions&lt;/em&gt; a user has to perform to achieve his goal, the &lt;em&gt;less likely&lt;/em&gt; it is that he will follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UyYLpVTD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fny82g6var0bh8eb2h9y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UyYLpVTD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fny82g6var0bh8eb2h9y.png" alt="Attention span over the years"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution? &lt;em&gt;Frequent actions&lt;/em&gt; should be large buttons, placed in easily reachable zones. Another method to minimize the user's effort is by opting for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no action&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;scroll&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;click&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you absolutely have to use &lt;strong&gt;clicks&lt;/strong&gt;, make sure you minimize the number of &lt;strong&gt;clicks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-reduce-load-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Reduce Load time
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perception of the speed of the website is based on &lt;em&gt;load time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;smoothness of animations&lt;/em&gt;. What matters the most to users is that your website &lt;strong&gt;feels fast&lt;/strong&gt; (even if it is just their perception).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the previous point about dwindling &lt;strong&gt;attention spans&lt;/strong&gt;, delays longer than a &lt;strong&gt;couple of seconds&lt;/strong&gt; will often make users leave the website, so make sure that your website loads fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy yourself a few more seconds&lt;/em&gt; by using &lt;em&gt;smooth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;captivating&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;loading animations&lt;/strong&gt; like these: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YDXp9l-1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/in87leaykiq6gr6o0kx4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YDXp9l-1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/in87leaykiq6gr6o0kx4.gif" alt="Loading Animation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-intuitive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Intuitive
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often new Designers, trying to separate themselves from the herd design &lt;em&gt;aesthetically pleasing&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;utterly confusing&lt;/em&gt; layouts which leave the users scratching their heads even to accomplish small tasks. Quite evidently, the &lt;strong&gt;user engagement&lt;/strong&gt; drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;or websites&lt;/em&gt;) who make them feel stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should use &lt;em&gt;common website patterns and interfaces&lt;/em&gt; instead of making the users learn something new, as &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;easy-to-use&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;interfaces&lt;/em&gt; help users concentrate on the content and navigate through it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3Y0vbolg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ip00mkn0mdorm7dols8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3Y0vbolg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ip00mkn0mdorm7dols8.jpg" alt="Intuitive layout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give yourself a &lt;strong&gt;pat on the back&lt;/strong&gt;; now you too can be a great &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt; designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--skFWOVr5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s864nh48x3xyji7md7kq.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--skFWOVr5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s864nh48x3xyji7md7kq.gif" alt="Pat on the Back"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you will employ these concepts in your applications and make awe-inspiring websites :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional Programming in Ruby – State</title>
      <author>Brandon Weaver</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 03:47:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/baweaver/functional-programming-in-ruby-state-13p2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/baweaver/functional-programming-in-ruby-state-13p2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ruby is, by nature, an Object Oriented language. It also takes a lot of hints from Functional languages like Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular opinion, Functional Programming is not an opposite pole on the spectrum. It’s another way of thinking about the same problems that can be very beneficial to Ruby programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, you’re probably already using a lot of Functional concepts. You don’t have to get all the way to Haskell, Scala, or other languages to get the benefits either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this series is to cover Functional Programming in a more pragmatic light as it pertains to Ruby programmers. That means that some concepts will not be rigorous proofs or truly pure ivory FP, and that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll focus on examples you can use to make your programs better today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, let’s take a look at our first subject: State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is a partial rewrite and update of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@baweaver/functional-programming-in-ruby-state-5e55d40b4e67"&gt;my own series on Medium on Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;. It has been modernized and updated a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#functional-programming-and-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Functional Programming and State
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prime concepts of Functional Programming is immutable state. In Ruby it may not be entirely practical to forego it altogether, but the concept is still exceptionally valuable to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By foregoing state, we make our applications easier to reason about and test. The secret is that you don’t entirely need to forego it to get some of these benefits, and that's what we need to keep in mind with Ruby: there are always tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#defining-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Defining State
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is state exactly? State is the data that flows through your program, and the concept of immutable state means that once it’s set it’s set. No changing it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Mutation of state!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That especially applies to methods:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reject!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By performing that action, we’ve mutated the array we passed in. Now imagine we have two or three more functions which also mutate the array and we get into a bit of an issue. In general it's not great to mutate data that's passed into your function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pure function is one that does not mutate its inputs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s slower, but it’s much easier to predict that this is going to return us a new array. Every time I give it input A, it gives me back result B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#has-that-ever-really-happened"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Has That Ever Really Happened?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, one can preach all day on the merits of pure functions, but until you find yourself in a situation where it bites you the benefits may not be readily apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one time in Javascript where I’d used &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; to test the output of a game board. It would look fine, but when I added one more &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; to it all of my tests broke!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as it turned out the &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt; function was mutating my board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me longer than I want to admit here how long it took me to realize this was happening, but mutation can have subtle cascading effects on your program unless you keep it under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the secret though, you don’t have to exclusively avoid it, you just need to manage it in such a way that it’s very clear when and where mutations happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ruby, frequently state mutations are indicated with &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; as a suffix. Not always, though, because methods like &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; break those rules so keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#isolate-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Isolate State
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method of dealing with state is to keep it in the box. A pure function might look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When given the same inputs, it will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; give us back the same outputs. That’s handy, but there are ways to hide tricks from it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;count_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;each_with_object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;count_by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:even?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# =&amp;gt; {false=&amp;gt;2, true=&amp;gt;1}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Newer versions of Ruby have the &lt;code&gt;tally&lt;/code&gt; function which would be used like this to get a similar result: &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3].map(&amp;amp;:even?).tally&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, we’re mutating that hash for each and every value in the array. Not so strictly speaking, when given the same input we get back the exact same output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that make it functionally pure? No. What we’ve done here is created isolated state that’s only present inside our function. Nothing on the outside knows about what we’re doing to the hash inside the function, and in Ruby this is an acceptable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is though, isolate state still requires that functions do one and only one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#single-responsibility-and-io-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Single Responsibility and IO State
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions should do one and only one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this type of pattern very commonly in newer programmers code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;attr_reader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:members&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_member&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Member name: "&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;gets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;chomp&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Added member!"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that we’re conflating a lot of things in one function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking a user for a member name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting that name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifying the user we added a member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not the concern of our class, it only needs to know how to add a member, anything else is outside the scope of that method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first this seems harmless, as you’re only really getting input and outputting at the end. The problems we run into are that &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; is going to pause the test, waiting for input, and &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; is going to return &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would we test such a thing?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'#add_member'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vg"&gt;$stdin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;StringIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Havenwood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vg"&gt;$stdin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;STDIN&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'adds a member'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby_club&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby_club&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_member&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby_club&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Havenwood'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of code. We have to intercept &lt;code&gt;STDIN&lt;/code&gt; (standard input) to make it work which makes our test code a lot harder to read as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at a more focused implementation, the only concern it has is that it gets a new member as input and returns all the members as output.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;attr_reader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:members&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All we need to test now is this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'#add_member'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'adds a member'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby_club&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ruby_club&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Havenwood'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Havenwood'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s abstracted from the concern of dealing with &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt;), another form of state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say that your Ruby Club has to also run with a CLI, or maybe load results from a file. How do you refactor it to work? Your current class is conflated with the idea that it has to get input and deal with output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds up to very brittle tests and code that are going to give you problems over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#static-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Static State
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common pattern is to abstract data into constants. This alone isn’t a bad idea, but can result in your classes and methods being effectively hardcoded to work in one way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SampleLoader&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;SAMPLES_DIR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/samples/ruby_samples'&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@loaded_samples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;load_sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@loaded_samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SAMPLES_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s great as long as you’re only concerned with that specific directory, but what if we need to make a sample loader for &lt;code&gt;elixir_samples&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rust_samples&lt;/code&gt;? We have a problem. Our constant has become a piece of static state we cannot change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is to use an idea called injection. We inject the prerequisite knowledge into the class instead of hardcoding the value in a constant:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SampleLoader&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;base_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@base_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base_path&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@loaded_samples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;load_sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@loaded_samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@base_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now our sample loader really doesn’t care where it gets samples from, as long as that file exists somewhere on the disk. Granted there are potential risks with caching as well, but that’s an exercise left to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to cheat this is by using default values, set to a constant, but for some this may be a bit to implicit. Use wisely:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;SampleLoader&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="no"&gt;SAMPLES_DIR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/samples/ruby_samples'&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;base_path: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;SAMPLES_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@base_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;base_path&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@loaded_samples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;load_sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@loaded_samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vi"&gt;@base_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#io-state-reading-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IO State — Reading Files
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your Ruby Club has an idea of loading members. We remembered to not statically code paths this time:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;member&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;load_members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem this round is that we’re relying on the fact that the members file is not only a file, but also in a &lt;code&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; format. It makes our loader very inflexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve become entangled in another type of IO state: we’re too concerned with how we load data into our club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you wanted to switch it out with a database like &lt;code&gt;SQLite&lt;/code&gt;, or maybe even just use &lt;code&gt;YAML&lt;/code&gt; instead. That’s a very hard task with the code like it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some solutions to this problem I see from newer developers are to make multiple “loaders” to deal with different types of inputs. What if it’s none of the concern of our club in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we extract the entire concept of loading members, we could have code like this instead:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight ruby"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;attr_reader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:members&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;add_members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="vi"&gt;@members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_members&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'data.yml'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="no"&gt;RubyClub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new_members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wait-isnt-this-just-separation-of-concerns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wait, isn’t this just Separation of Concerns?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun thing about OO and FP is that a lot of the same concepts can apply, they just tend to have different names. They may not be exact overlaps, but a lot of what you learn from a Functional language may feel very familiar from best practices in a more Imperative style language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, keeping state under control is an exercise in separation of concerns. Pure functions coupled with this can make exceptionally flexible and robust code that is easier to test, reason about, and extend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common point of confusion is that Functional Programming is an entirely new and independent paradigm from Object Oriented Programming, when in fact they share quite a few ideas, and often times are more complimentary than some would like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State in Ruby may not be entirely pure, but by keeping it under control your programs will be substantially easier to work with later. In programming, that’s everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be reading and upgrading code far more than you’re outright writing it, so the more you do to write it flexibly from the start the easier it will be to read and work with later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this course will be more focused on pragmatic usages of Functional Programming as they relate to Ruby. We could focus on an entire derived Lambda Calculus scheme and make a truly pure program, but it would be slow and incredibly tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s also fun to play with on occasion just to see how it works. If that’s of interest this is a great book on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025481.do"&gt;Understanding Computation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep exploring that rabbit hole, Raganwald does a lot to delight here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/combinators"&gt;Kestrels, Quirky Birds, and Hopeless Egocentricity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pure CSS reaction component with one element</title>
      <author>Posandu Mapa</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 03:20:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/posandu/pure-css-reaction-component-with-one-element-42jo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/posandu/pure-css-reaction-component-with-one-element-42jo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will share you a pure CSS reaction component that is made from one element. I also built it accessibility in mind. Here's a preview of that. &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j72AWX2C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k61wm76l39qt7s3728iu.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j72AWX2C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k61wm76l39qt7s3728iu.gif" alt="The preview"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The HTML
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"checkbox"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"reaction"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data-reaction=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"🦄"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"--color:#31d2f7"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this to work. You must set the &lt;code&gt;data-reaction&lt;/code&gt; attribute to whatever the emoji you want. And Change the CSS variable &lt;code&gt;--color&lt;/code&gt; to the color of that emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick TIP: If you are a Windows 10 user, press the &lt;code&gt;Windows Key&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; to get a list of emojis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the good part&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.reaction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-webkit-appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-moz-appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;appearance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-webkit-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-ms-flexbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-webkit-box-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-ms-flex-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-webkit-transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-o-transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;--color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.reaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-webkit-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-ms-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.reaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;pointer-events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;-webkit-transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/ehsaniara/go-task-scheduler-with-distributed-lock-4am1</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#golang-interval-job-timer-with-distributed-lock"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt;lang &lt;strong&gt;Interval&lt;/strong&gt; job timer, with distributed &lt;strong&gt;Lock&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;goInterLock&lt;/code&gt; is golang job/task scheduler with distributed locking mechanism. In distributed system locking is prevent task been executed in every instant that has the scheduler, For example, if your application has a task of calling some external APIs or doing some DB querying every 10 minutes, the lock prevents the process been run in every instance of that application and you ended up running that task multiple time every 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Start&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;go get github.com/ehsaniara/gointerlock
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#local-scheduler-single-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Local Scheduler (Single App)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Interval every 2 seconds)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;job&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gointerlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GoInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="n"&gt;myJob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatalf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error: %s"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#distributed-scheduler-scaled-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Distributed Scheduler (Scaled Up)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#existing-redis-connection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Existing Redis Connection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should already configure your Redis connection and pass it into the &lt;code&gt;GoInterLock&lt;/code&gt;. Also make sure you are giving the&lt;br&gt;
unique name per job&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: configure redis connection &lt;code&gt;redisConnection.Rdb&lt;/code&gt; from the existing application and pass it into the Job. for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redisConnector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;"localhost:6379"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"myRedisPassword"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;               
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Pass the redis connection into the &lt;code&gt;GoInterval&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;job&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gointerlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GoInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="n"&gt;myJob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;"MyTestJob"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;RedisConnector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;redisConnector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jobTicker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ctx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatalf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error: %s"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;in both examples &lt;code&gt;myJob&lt;/code&gt; is your function, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;myJob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;" - called"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: currently &lt;code&gt;GoInterLock&lt;/code&gt; does not support any argument for the job function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#built-in-redis-connector"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Built in Redis Connector
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another way is to use an existing redis connection:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;job&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gointerlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GoInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="s"&gt;"MyTestJob"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="n"&gt;myJob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;RedisHost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="s"&gt;"localhost:6379"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;RedisPassword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"myRedisPassword"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;//remove this line if no pass (AUTH)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Fatalf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Error: %s"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gointerlock-is-using-goredis-for-redis-connection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GoInterLock is using &lt;a href="https://github.com/go-redis/redis"&gt;go-redis&lt;/a&gt; for Redis Connection.
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a better front-end developer, one of the many projects you are bound to do is building a landing page. Whether it is embedded with a video or just a page mixed with images and text, you are encouraged to take on this task to challenge yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will give you insights on how to create and include a video into a landing page using HTML and CSS with JavaScript for interactivity on the nav menu on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To utilise the power of a landing page for your marketing campaigns, it should spark an interest in your target audience. In all of this, let us know what a landing page is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-landing-page"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a landing page?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/landing-pages/"&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/a&gt;, they say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landing page is a standalone web page that a person "lands" on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this tutorial, we will gain mastery of how to create a landing page from scratch including an enticing headline to reel users in and a call-to-action (CTA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-we-will-make"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What we will make
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We completed the entire project on &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/terieyenike/pen/PomOgYq"&gt;Codepen&lt;/a&gt; and here is what the final project will look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sEkLBHCW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25850598/126911108-b01573a3-e5a7-457a-a917-baaaf4fdbaeb.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sEkLBHCW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25850598/126911108-b01573a3-e5a7-457a-a917-baaaf4fdbaeb.gif" alt="complete view"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting one, and I know you are already excited to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we need to complete this project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our good old friend, HTML and CSS skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A text editor (I'd suggest &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;) or use any other editor you are comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, we wrote all the code snippets in &lt;a href="https://codepen.io/pen"&gt;codepen&lt;/a&gt;, an online text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shall-webegin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Shall we...begin?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are using Codepen, in the index.html file, include all the necessary syntax needed. In the index.html file, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A section tag with a class &lt;code&gt;showcase&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the class &lt;code&gt;showcase&lt;/code&gt;, we will use nested containers such as  tag for our navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video HTML element embeds a media player that playback the video continuously in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;overlay&lt;/code&gt; class in a div container will help us to create an effect to reduce the opacity on the video HTML element and also add a blend mode to the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A div container &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; which includes the following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A header &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which reads Never stop as the title leading to the tagline with another header &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag which describes the purpose of the header. Finally, we have a CTA in a link tag that says Explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unordered list, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the class &lt;code&gt;social&lt;/code&gt; will contain all the social links in an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag will display all the menu on a mobile view and a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; class &lt;code&gt;toggle&lt;/code&gt; that switch with a close and a hamburger menu icon when clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at our HTML file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Travel video landing page&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"showcase"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"logo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Travel&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"desktop"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav__link nav__link--active"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Home&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav__link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;News&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav__link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Destination&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nav__link"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Contact&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have just gone through everything we need for the rest of our build. What we will do next is to make the building block, the HTML more beautiful with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; file, we need to have the following properties which you can get from the complete stylesheet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900&amp;amp;display=swap')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Poppins'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above-declared properties used, we made use of media queries for the responsive layout to suit different devices and their orientation (either landscape or portrait). To find out more on how this works and its implementation, check &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  Interaction with JavaScript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section is as important as other aspects that have been highlighted in this article. With JS, you can control how users interact with the website such as what happens when a button is clicked and so many other activities that can occur on a web app. Include this snippet of code in your &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;menuToggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showcase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.showcase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;menuToggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showcase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;menus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;menuToggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggleMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;menus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;menu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toggleMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code block, we queried our page using the &lt;code&gt;Document Object Model (DOM)&lt;/code&gt; to target a specific element that we will add a click event listener that occurs when a user clicks on the menu icon, the nav menus comes into view and closes when the close icon or any of the menu links are clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of a landing page for advertising campaigns is vital when you want users to get an understanding of your product with the ability for users to take quick action which is the primary objective of any landing page you find on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Flex vs Grid</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a cat person. I am not against dogs. There are times I even enjoy them. But given the chance, I would always choose the cat over the dog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's how I have been treating &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp"&gt;CSS Flexbox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been the cat that I kept on choosing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today. I had to choose the dog. And you know what? &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp"&gt;CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt; was not going to fight with me like Flexbox was. It was pretty compliant, actually. It's like it &lt;strong&gt;wanted&lt;/strong&gt; to make me happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just here to say that sometimes, circumstances are just better suited to having a dog than a cat. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Performing Benchmark Tests in Go</title>
      <author>Eduardo Hitek</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 00:13:21 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Benchmark testing in programming is the act of efficiently comparing performance between algorithms in order to choose which approach to follow in certain scenarios. We can also apply when deciding which external libraries or frameworks to use, in addition to evaluating if any refactoring will bring harm to our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Go language already has tools for these types of tests by default, making the experience more user-friendly and without the need for external tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see how to verify this in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#analyzing-palindromic-verification-performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Analyzing Palindromic Verification Performance
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palindrome is a word or group of words that have linear symmetry, that is, they remain the same when read backwards. A more common example is the word &lt;code&gt;level&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;anna&lt;/code&gt; where the reading order does not change the meaning of the word. We can also obtain this effect by combining a few words, forming simple sentences like: &lt;code&gt;never odd or even&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite common in job interviews that you are faced with the challenge of writing an algorithm to check whether a phrase or word is palindrome or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For examples I used 3 different algorithms to analyze which will have the best performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;PalindromeReverse&lt;/strong&gt;: receives a string, reverses it and checks if the 2 strings are equal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func reverse(s string) string {
   runes := []rune(s)
   for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i&amp;lt;j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
       runes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i]
   }
   return string(runes)
}

func palindromeReverse(str string) bool {
   strReversed := reverse(str)
   return strReversed == str
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;PalindromeFromEnd&lt;/strong&gt;: cycles through the string comparing the 1st word with the last and so on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func palindromeFromEnd(str string) bool {
   runes := []rune(str)
   length := len(runes)
   for i := 0; i &amp;lt; length; i++ {
       if runes[i] != runes[length-1-i] {
           return false
       }
   }
   return true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;palindromeFromMiddle&lt;/strong&gt;: runs from the middle characters to the beginning/end of the string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func palindromeFromMiddle(str string) bool {
   runes := []rune(str)
   length := len(runes)
   middleI, middleJ := (length/2)-1, (length/2)+1
   if length%2 == 0 {
       middleJ -= 1
   }

   for i, j := middleI, middleJ; i &amp;gt;= 0; i, j = i-1, j+1 {
       if runes[i] != runes[j] {
           return false
       }
   }
   return true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the functions created, now we need to write the Benchmark Tests functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#benchmark-tests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Benchmark Tests
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, let's create the test file &lt;code&gt;main_test.go&lt;/code&gt; and within it create the following test functions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func BenchmarkPalindromeFromMiddle_Banana(b *testing.B) {
   for n := 0; n&amp;lt;b.N; n++ {
       palindromeFromMiddle("banana")
   }
}
func BenchmarkPalindromeReverse_Banana(b *testing.B) {
   for n := 0; n&amp;lt;b.N; n++ {
       palindromeReverse("banana")
   }
}
func BenchmarkPalindromeFromEnd_Banana(b *testing.B) {
   for n := 0; n&amp;lt;b.N; n++ {
       palindromeFromEnd("banana")
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we are asking Go to run each of the functions with the &lt;code&gt;banana&lt;/code&gt; string. Next step is to run the following command in the terminal: &lt;code&gt;go test -bench=. -benchtime=1s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example main*
❯ go test -bench=. -benchtime=1s
goos: darwin
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example
cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz
BenchmarkPalindromeFromMiddle_Banana-12 69054604 16.36 ns/op
BenchmarkPalindromeReverse_Banana-12 16145308 69.83 ns/op
BenchmarkPalindromeFromEnd_Banana-12 91725068 15.84 ns/op
PASS
ok github.com/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example 4.563s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the argument we informed, each benchmark function is executed for 1 second and we have 2 pieces of information for each: Number of executions and average time of each execution. For this example of a non-palindromic word, and when the difference was between the 1st and the last letter, the &lt;strong&gt;BenchmarkPalindromeFromEnd_Banana&lt;/strong&gt; was more performant because it had a lower average time per operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next example we use a word major palindrome (&lt;em&gt;nomelgibsonisacasinosbiglemon&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example main*
❯ go test -bench=. -benchtime=1s
goos: darwin
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example
cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz
BenchmarkPalindromeFromMiddle_nomelgibsonisacasinosbiglemon-12 18193920 56.29 ns/op
BenchmarkPalindromeReverse_nomelgibsonisacasinosbiglemon-12 4255890 272.6 ns/op
BenchmarkPalindromeFromEnd_nomelgibsonisacasinosbiglemon-12 16961797 63.68 ns/op
PASS
ok github.com/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example 5.078s

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this example the &lt;strong&gt;BenchmarkPalindromeFromMiddle&lt;/strong&gt; came out ahead. The last test uses a much longer string (+800 characters) and we confirm which function does better in this scenario:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dev/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example main*
❯ go test -bench=. -benchtime=1s
goos: darwin
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example
cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz
BenchmarkPalindromeFromMiddle_longstring-12 672807 1774 ns/op
BenchmarkPalindromeReverse_longstring-12 141945 7784 ns/op
BenchmarkPalindromeFromEnd_longstring-12 524437 2121 ns/op
PASS
ok github.com/eduardohitek/go-benchmark-example 5.006s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we could see how easy it is to perform this type of tests to assess the changes and performance of algorithms in Go applications.&lt;/p&gt;
