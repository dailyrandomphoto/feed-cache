      <title>Sexism, Racism, Toxic Positivity, and TailwindCSS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You might think that these things don't belong in the same article, but here we are, this week in front-end development, having the same conversation that seems to be never-ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a complexity here that I find is being painfully pushed aside to focus on one thing: TailwindCSS versus... not TailwindCSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-defense-of-tailwindcss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In defense of TailwindCSS
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start by saying that I am using TailwindCSS professionally on a project. It is doing exactly what we want - it's making our development and maintenance of the project faster. To say it "does nothing" is factually incorrect. We are using Ember to build this particular application and the way in which we modularize this application works very well with TailwindCSS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to specifically point out that the "it's WET not DRY" argument is flimsy and wrong. It definitely encourages "&lt;a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;" programming, and I find that we are creating components in a smarter way, recognizing when UI blocks have more in common than they don't and splitting them off into their own component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that while the idea of "separating content from presentation" was once very pragmatic, and may still be for some cases, it's no longer a blanket rule. We're not slicing our front-end development cake the same way we used to, and it's perfectly acceptable that this varies from team to team and project to project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think it's important that we frame our critique and support for technology in a way that makes it clear we understand that while it did or did not work for us, or our team, or our project; we know it's for our case and our reasons are reflective of that specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TailwindCSS is working for this project on my team. That's not to say it will work for you, or your project. And that's perfectly okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-defense-of-criticism-of-tailwindcss"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In defense of criticism of TailwindCSS
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan"&gt;Adam Wathan&lt;/a&gt;'s tweet at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan"&gt;Sara Soueidan&lt;/a&gt;'s tweet of "&lt;a href="https://dev.to/brianboyko/tailwindcss-adds-complexity-does-nothing-3hpn"&gt;TailwindCSS: Adds complexity, does nothing&lt;/a&gt;" I (wrongly) assumed that this article must be incredibly toxic to warrant such a response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OW_c8-_o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5pae666ydmquurzrgscy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OW_c8-_o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5pae666ydmquurzrgscy.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1390663794985250816"&gt;Link to tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commentary going around about being considerate of the people behind software development (something I absolutely champion frequently) was mainly people standing up for Adam and TailwindCSS with supreme vigor. I thought back to &lt;a href="https://jamie.build/const"&gt;A fucking rant about fucking const vs fucking let&lt;/a&gt; and even though I knew it wasn't meant to be taken that seriously, I'm critical of toxic satire, and so I came to const's defense, and I thought that this must be an incredibly toxic article because of the response to Sara's tweet of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I read it. While the framing was lacking the nuance I expressed above, it wasn't toxic. Not even remotely toxic. The article is a perfectly fine piece of critical thought. It's a great resource (despite lacking nuance) for folks who want to know if TailwindCSS might be the right tool for their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticisms aren't incorrect or invalid, and they need to be stated. If TailwindCSS wouldn't be good for a person, team, or project, we should care enough about those folks' time and effort to elevate those criticisms so they move quickly to the best tool for the job for THEM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't that the entire point of creating these tools at all? The name is tailwind... it's not a tailwind if it's going in the opposite direction the plane is traveling. Do we want our tools to create friction and slow people down? No? Good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#toxic-positivity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Toxic Positivity
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day went on, I saw Sara's tweet of the article disappear. When I investigated why, what I saw was a Lebanese woman being bullied for sharing an opinion with a white dude in tech and simply linking to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media has created a culture where we track and measure positive engagement. Actually, positive isn't even the right word. Adoration, favorable opinion, and endorsement are much better words for the kind of engagement we've come to not only expect, but anything outside of that is unacceptable and flat out rejected. I personally feel the need to "like" every single reply to me because I am so worried about giving folks who interact with me the idea that I hated what they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's become so polarized: either you emphatically adore and approve of the things people make, or you toxically hate it. Not because that's what's actually happening, but because anything neutral or critical is now going to ruin someone's day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this was the majority of the bullying that Sara received, the response to the article, of course, is far more tame and respectful. So tame, in fact, that the author used it to share that he is working on his OWN tool (because, well, of course he is). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam himself stated that he was unbothered by the article itself, but rather held Sara accountable for daring to not only agree with the criticism, but to share that with her audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gEgzoY1P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c92sgry3wf33g4zl61qp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gEgzoY1P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c92sgry3wf33g4zl61qp.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1390667757457379331"&gt;Link to tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while yes, this is toxic positivity, it's not about the critique of TailwindCSS. This is entirely about Sara sharing that critique at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sexism-and-racism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sexism and Racism
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Adam may not be consciously aware of what he's done, his response to Sara is absolutely rooted in his own biases to give the benefit of the doubt only to folks like himself. The criticism is easy for him to internalize and move on from because it comes from someone that he views is like he is. Sara has had to earn his respect and admiration, as a non-American woman of color, instead of getting it from default in-group bias, and anything other than the admiration he gives her is felt as betrayal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in majority groups in communities (and, frankly, in societies in general) act incredibly entitled to reciprocity of affections from those who are marginalized in those groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam's response is a prime case study in this. He expressed how it literally ruined his day that she did not return the same admiration and respect he felt he gave her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's the thing: while there may be admiration, there's certainly not respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man incited bullying onto a Lebanese woman for sharing a critique of a framework he wrote not for the critique itself, but because she didn't give him the admiration he felt entitled to. That's not respect. That's systemic entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Berry - Open-source React Dashboard Template</title>
      <author>Sm0ke</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 14:38:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sm0ke/berry-open-source-react-dashboard-template-4fdn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sm0ke/berry-open-source-react-dashboard-template-4fdn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Coders,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article presents &lt;a href="https://docs.appseed.us/content/react-template/berry-react-dashboard"&gt;Berry&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/sm0ke/react-dashboards-open-source-apps-1c7j"&gt;React Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  crafted for free by &lt;em&gt;CodedThemes&lt;/em&gt; agency. This product is a creative yet minimal React Dashboard built on top of Material UI meant to be lightweight and highly customizable. For newcomers, React is an open-source library, probably the most popular one at the moment we speak, actively supported by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/em&gt; - Content provided by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.admin-dashboards.com/"&gt;Admin Dashboards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/codedthemes/berry-free-react-admin-template"&gt;Berry React Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; - source code published on Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free &lt;a href="https://dev.to/sm0ke/react-dashboards-open-source-apps-1c7j"&gt;React Dashboards&lt;/a&gt; - a curated list published on Dev.to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rGUyksbo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/admin-dashboards/berry-free-react-admin-template/main/media/react-dashboard-berry-intro.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rGUyksbo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/admin-dashboards/berry-free-react-admin-template/main/media/react-dashboard-berry-intro.gif" alt="Berry - Open-source React Dashboard Template, animated presentation."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Berry is a complete game-changer &lt;strong&gt;React Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; Template with easy and intuitive responsive design as on retina screens or laptops that comes with a few nice features "out-of-the-box": Material UI design with many beautifully styled-components, easy to use code structure, and comprehensive documentation.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to build the code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download and compile &lt;strong&gt;Berry&lt;/strong&gt;, we weed Git command-line tool to clone the sources from the public repository and NodeJs, at least version 10 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step #1&lt;/strong&gt; - clone the sources&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/codedthemes/berry-free-react-admin-template.git
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;berry-free-react-admin-template
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step #2&lt;/strong&gt; - Install modules (via Npm or Yarn)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm run &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# via NPM &lt;/span&gt;
// OR
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step #3&lt;/strong&gt; - Start the project with LIVE reload on code changes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm run start
// OR
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;yarn start 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the product is compiled the browser window should be started automatically and we can see &lt;strong&gt;Berry Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; in action.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry React Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; - Login Page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h9fIHfpf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dtqqh4t259ueu48dbb0a.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h9fIHfpf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dtqqh4t259ueu48dbb0a.png" alt="Berry React Dashboard - Login Screen."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry React Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; - Icons Page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ryzarMD2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/goz5p46vey5kgymp0cyf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ryzarMD2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/goz5p46vey5kgymp0cyf.png" alt="Berry React Dashboard - Icons Screen."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berry React Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; - UI Colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Multi-Threaded JavaScript In Browser</title>
      <author>Bibek</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 14:16:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bibekkakati/multi-thread-javascript-in-browser-4hlo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bibekkakati/multi-thread-javascript-in-browser-4hlo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we all know, JavaScript is a single-threaded language so when executing scripts the site becomes unresponsive until the scripts are finished.&lt;br&gt;
To avoid blocking the interaction of the site we can spawn a worker that will execute the scripts in the background. Thus, we can improve the performance of our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the article to see how can we achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#30DaysOfAppwrite : Accounts &amp; Users API</title>
      <author>Christy Jacob</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 14:08:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-accounts-users-api-4592</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-accounts-users-api-4592</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://30days.appwrite.io/"&gt;#30DaysOfAppwrite&lt;/a&gt; is a month long event focused at giving developers a walkthrough of all of Appwrite's features, starting from the basics to more advanced features like Cloud Functions! Alongside we will also be building a fully featured Medium Clone to demonstrate how these&lt;br&gt;
concepts can be applied when building a real world app. We also have some exciting prizes for developers who follow along with us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accounts-amp-users-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accounts &amp;amp; Users API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Day 8 👋. The Users and Accounts APIs seem to raise questions for newer Appwrite devs on our &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/discord"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; server. Today, it's time to answer all of them. If you followed us yesterday, we reviewed the differences between the Client and Server Side SDKs and discussed the scopes accessible to each of them. So if you haven't already, we recommend you to read that first for some context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-main-difference"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Main Difference?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a TLDR; this table should help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Users API&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Accounts API&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Server Side API&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Client Side API&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Accessed using an API Key&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Accessed using a Cookie (or JWT)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Operates in an Admin Scope&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Operates in the scope of the currently logged in user&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Perform CRUD operations on all of your app's users&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Perform CRUD operations on the currently logged in user&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're in a quest for more information, read along 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Users API is part of the &lt;strong&gt;Server Side SDK&lt;/strong&gt; specification and operates in an &lt;strong&gt;admin scope&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e using an API key) with access to all your project users. The Users API allows you to perform actions like create, update, delete and list your app's users, create, update and delete their preferences, etc. The complete documentation for the Users API can be found &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/server/users"&gt;in our docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the Accounts API operates in the scope of the currently logged in user (using a cookie or JWT) and usually using a client-side integration. The Accounts API allows you to create an account, create user sessions using username and password as well as OAuth2 , update your accounts' email and password, initiate password recoveries, initiate email verifications, etc. The complete documentation for the Accounts API can be found &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deep-dive-into-the-accounts-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deep Dive into the Accounts API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's try to understand the Accounts API a little better. Some of the most notable methods of the Accounts API are the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountCreateSession"&gt;&lt;code&gt;createSession()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountCreateOAuth2Session"&gt;&lt;code&gt;createOAuth2Session()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; methods. If successful, their response contains a &lt;code&gt;set-cookie&lt;/code&gt; header which then tells the browser to save and include this cookie with every subsequent request. In our Flutter ( and upcoming Android ) SDKs, we make use of a &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/CookieStore"&gt;Cookie Jar / Cookie Store&lt;/a&gt; to achieve similar functionality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appwrite 0.8&lt;/strong&gt; adds support for &lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Users&lt;/strong&gt; 🤩 .When you develop an application, there might be times when you want to let a user interact with parts of your app before they're signed in. This also increases the conversion rate of your users, since the hurdle of registration is very high. If an anonymous user decides to sign up to your app, they can later convert their account using their email and password or the OAuth method. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 0.8, our Dashboard has been updated as well giving you finer control over the allowed login methods for your project 🤩 !! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AiHZGkrm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wh639p1p2p29n5msywgn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AiHZGkrm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wh639p1p2p29n5msywgn.png" alt="Enable login methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's make our first request using the &lt;strong&gt;Accounts API&lt;/strong&gt;. To see this in action in a complete app, check out the source code of &lt;a href="https://github.com/appwrite?q=todo&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=&amp;amp;sort="&gt;our demo apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be using a JavaScript example for this tutorial. Whether you're using a framework or vanilla JS, it's really easy to get started - our &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-web"&gt;Getting Started for Web&lt;/a&gt; tutorial explains how. Once you have installed and initialised your SDK, you can follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  create()
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the method to use if you want to implement &lt;strong&gt;Sign Up&lt;/strong&gt; functionality in your app. Do note that this will only create a new user. You will &lt;strong&gt;still need to call&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;createSession()&lt;/code&gt; method using the same email and password to actually create a new session for this user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;email@example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Success&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Failure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#createsession"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  createSession()
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to achieve &lt;strong&gt;Login&lt;/strong&gt; functionality in your app, this is the method you need. This method creates a session for an existing user. So make sure you have already called &lt;code&gt;create()&lt;/code&gt; before this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Using the promise syntax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;email@example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Success&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Failure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Or using async/await&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;email@example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you inspect the response from &lt;code&gt;createSession()&lt;/code&gt; you'll find the following headers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;set-cookie:
a_session_6062f9c2c09ce_legacy=eyJpZCI6IjYwNmI3Y....NmVhMzQ2In0=; expires=Wed, 27-Apr-2022 14:17:29 GMT; path=/; domain=.demo.appwrite.io; secure; httponly

set-cookie:
a_session_6062f9c2c09ce=eyJpZCI6IjYwNmI3Y....NmVhMzQ2In0=; expires=Wed, 27-Apr-2022 14:17:29 GMT; path=/; domain=.demo.appwrite.io; secure; httponly; samesite=None

x-fallback-cookies
{"a_session_6062f9c2c09ce":"eyJpZCI6IjYwNmI3Y....NmVhMzQ2In0="}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An Appwrite session cookie uses the following syntax: &lt;code&gt;a_session_&amp;lt;PROJECT-ID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a_session_&amp;lt;PROJECT-ID&amp;gt;_legacy&lt;/code&gt;. Since many browsers disable 3rd party cookies, we use the &lt;code&gt;x-fallback-cookies&lt;/code&gt; header to store the cookie in local storage and then use it in subsequent requests if the cookie has not already been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deletesession"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  deleteSession()
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement &lt;strong&gt;Logout&lt;/strong&gt; functionality, you will need to delete a session using a session ID. You can delete the current session by passing &lt;code&gt;current&lt;/code&gt; in place of the &lt;code&gt;SESSION_ID&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deleteSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;[SESSION_ID]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Success&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Failure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We've covered just a few essential methods to convey how the API works. The complete list of functionality can be found &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deep-dive-into-the-users-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deep Dive into the Users API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can achieve all the functionality we discussed above with the Users API as well. However, you would be performing all the actions using an API key. If you're following along from yesterday, you would already have a project and API key set up. Otherwise, you can quickly get started &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-server"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  create()
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The create method can be used to create a new user. Do note that this is &lt;strong&gt;not the same&lt;/strong&gt; as creating a session using the Accounts API. There is no cookie involved here. Think of this as an admin, creating an account on behalf of one of his users. To create a session, the user will have use these credentials to login from a client side app.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;email@example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deletesession"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  deleteSession()
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that you have a Cloud Function that monitors account logins and alerts a user about a suspicious login from a different location or IP. In this case, as a preventive measure you might want to delete the session or block the account altogether until the real user takes action. The &lt;code&gt;deleteSession()&lt;/code&gt; method comes handy in this case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deleteSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;[USER_ID]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;[SESSION_ID]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So for some closing remarks, use the &lt;strong&gt;Accounts API&lt;/strong&gt; when building a client side app and the &lt;strong&gt;Users API&lt;/strong&gt; when building a server side app.&lt;br&gt;
In the next blog post, we will use the Accounts API to add some cool functionality to our blog app 🤩.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>"Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual (Second edition) by John Sonmez</title>
      <author>Sandor Dargo</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/sandordargo/soft-skills-the-software-developer-s-life-manual-second-edition-by-john-sonmez-29jp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second edition of the book and it was promised to include some important updates. As I liked the first edition and I could it get from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3q2z7Mj"&gt;Amazon for less than 10 Euros&lt;/a&gt;, I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I can say that most of the changes are all well-marked. This might seem a bit odd and breaks the reading flow, but on the other hand, it also shows how the view of the author on certain things changed and often this comes with some explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt sometimes that more parts should have been revised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that definitely didn't change is that I like the structure of the book. There are around 70 small chapters and this makes it easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the book also has some sections that you wouldn't necessarily expect from a book targeting developers: investing both in general and in real estate, health, fitness, philosophy. These topics are often neglected, but they are and they should be important parts of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to cover a couple of topics from the book a bit more in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-way-to-wealth"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The way to wealth
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone talks about wealth, the first question to ask, is the person credible in speaking about wealth? In fact, this verification should be extended. Whenever someone tries to teach something, you should verify if the person is an authentic source of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author seems credible as he has moved from corporate jobs to contracting ones, then both built his own businesses plus he successfully invested in real estates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is not a Warren Buffet for sure, but I guess most of us doesn't aim for those heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first question to define is what is wealth and what it means to be wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you earn a lot of money? Are you in the top 5 per cent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats, but the bad news is that you might be rich, yet it doesn't make you wealthy. According to his - and others' definition - being wealthy means that you have a "perpetual supply of more than you need".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that riches and wealth do not necessarily walk hand in hand, but you need two simple things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an automatically renewing supply of resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need less than that supply provides you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, we can see that making a lot of money is not enough. You might just spend more than you need and if that money comes from paychecks, it's not something that would qualify as something automatically renewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is an automatically renewing source?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, it's not your paycheck. You have to put in your work - almost - every day. But if you buy some assets, such as stocks that pay dividends, some bonds, business, royalty rights. Assets that generate money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to become wealthy, you'll need to accumulate assets generating passive income and - depending on how fast you want to go - lower the money you need to burn every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any new in this? Of course not and the book doesn't claim there is. It's just a reminder and some personal stories. The biggest value is that it's in a book for developers. You might not be interested in such topics in the first place, but the book might serve you as an eye-opener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-healthy-mind-in-a-healthy-body"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A healthy mind in a healthy body
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One another topic that is seldom discussed when you talk about the life of a developer is fitness. That's sad because our job, our lifestyle is more dangerous than one would assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting all day long is not what our body was created for. And let's be honest, often when we finish work, we just switch laptops or just close a window - no, not the one in your wall - and continue sitting till midnight - or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the chapters about fitness, you'll get some basic insights on the relationship between your diet, exercise, weight and fitness level. You'll get some ideas on how you should start out without compromising your goals right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems extremely important because apparently, it's very difficult to gain muscles and lose fat at the same time. My impression was that the author doesn't talk about people who are extremely overweight but only with some moderate extra fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not to judge, but probably the most negative part of the book for me was reading what kind of food John eats and how he prepares it. It's not unhealthy, but just mixing together different frozen, pre-cut ingredients with bulk egg white and put it in the microwave... Thanks, but no thanks. But I have to admit, for a lot of people eating such food would be a huge step forward. And to be fair, probably it's healthier than what I eat, just no so varied and exciting. We don't look for the same thing, and it's fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, given his pictures from the past and present, if I wanted to take some fitness advice, I'd consider his words. In fact, I'm considering some of them about repetitions and series and mostly that I should take the question of physical health more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stoicism-taking-over"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stoicism Taking Over
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While having an appropriate mindset was a cardinal question in the first edition as well, Stoicism didn't appear in it. I was happy to see it in the new edition. I can honestly say happy, as you could read some Stoic content from me already, including some &lt;a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2019/10/30/keep-calm-and-do-less"&gt;own posts&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2019/05/08/romes-last-citizen"&gt;book reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this book, you'll be able to get the most important ideas of Stoicism in a nutshell and some ways to apply them in your life as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to give you one idea. Whatever happens in your life, take it just as a fact. It's not a negative event, it's not a positive either. It's just an event. The interpretation of it comes from one person. That person is you. You have to actively choose your interpretation and then the most appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-best-takeaways-from-the-book"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My best takeaways from the book
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me share my three best takes of this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#negotiate-your-salary-negotiate-just-everything"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Negotiate your salary, negotiate just everything
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very important message. If you are offered a salary, it's almost sure you can get more than that and nobody will be offended if you try to negotiate. I never did, but for sure I will the next time (I'm not someone changing jobs often &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandor-dargo/"&gt;as you can see&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money you can gain in the long run can be quite important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salary is not the only thing you can negotiate. You negotiate multiple times a day without recognizing it, so why not make it a conscious activity and take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-on-your-pomodoros-instead-of-goals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus on your pomodoros instead of goals
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust the system as the author says. It doesn't mean the political establishment, but rather your own productivity system. If you want to achieve something, you have to put a supporting system in place. For him - and for me as well - a key element is the &lt;a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2018/12/05/reconquering-my-job"&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually have a goal in mind when I start a pomodoro. When I achieve it too quickly, often I just wander around the code, the article, I don't focus the same way anymore. And if I don't meet my goal, I might become a bit stressed and cranky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author suggests that on this low level of operating your system, you should focus on just pushing through the pomodoro, keep focused and work without a specific goal. You have your tasks of course, but you don't have a specific goal for your pomodoro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried and indeed, I felt I achieved more and I didn't get anxious if I ran into difficulties that took a bit more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#any-action-is-better-than-no-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Any action is better than no action
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, you will read a story about a couple who didn't finish renovating a bathroom because they could decide whether they should use a plexiglass panel or a plastic curtain. It took them like ten years just because they couldn't agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of the two options would have been better than none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot wait for perfect agreements, perfect moments, perfect ideas. Life is not perfect. And if we don't move forward, we will not get feedback, we will not get the information we are waiting for. If we take action, we might start going in the best direction, but nevertheless, we will move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3q2z7Mj"&gt;Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual&lt;/a&gt; is still a book I'd recommend. It's a very reminder of what matters a lot in your life: your mindset, taking care of your health and personal finances. &lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, if you read the first edition and you have no plans to read the latest version, don't have a fear of missing out. Instead, just take a book on Stoicism like &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/38veMsU"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://dailystoic.com/"&gt;Daily Stoic&lt;/a&gt; to learn a bit about this ancient philosophy of the doers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3q2z7Mj"&gt;Soft Skills&lt;/a&gt; will remind you of the importance of self-marketing, teach you the basics of creating wealth and maybe it will inspire you to live a healthier, fitter life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can there be anything more important than that? &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build a Weather App using JavaScript</title>
      <author>Fahad Hassan</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 13:46:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fahadhassan1213/build-a-weather-app-using-javascript-2g3h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fahadhassan1213/build-a-weather-app-using-javascript-2g3h</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's get started!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to get complete code visit : &lt;a href="https://github.com/fahadhassan1213/Weather-Teller"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some basic things we need to understand before creating a weather app are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We need to fetch weather data from a weather forecasting 
the platform using APIs&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;After fetching data we need to extract our required 
information from that weather data e.g: &lt;strong&gt;weather_condition, 
temperature&lt;/strong&gt; etc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fetching-weather-data-using-accuweather-apis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fetching Weather data using AccuWeather APIs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AccuWeather is an American company that provides international weather forecasting services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; to fetch weather information using APIs from Accuweather we first need to &lt;a href="https://developer.accuweather.com/user"&gt;create a user account&lt;/a&gt; on accuweather.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oYy9OUqB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/66k1y7fsrzi3v15n8o3t.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oYy9OUqB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/66k1y7fsrzi3v15n8o3t.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please visit &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FLd0w2oBnXY"&gt;Accuweather tutorial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a detailed video tutorial on how to get started with AccuWeather and to get APIs, which we are using in our code to fetch weather data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-html-structure-and-css-styling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic HTML Structure and CSS Styling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; for basic styling. To get the HTML and CSS file please visit &lt;a href="https://github.com/fahadhassan1213/Weather-Teller"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#javascript-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file &lt;code&gt;forecast.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-raw-forecastjs-endraw-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;code&gt;forecast.js&lt;/code&gt; File
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task# 1
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In forecast.js first, you need to initialize your &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;CXhPk82ZAZgV0ngVUWdVBVGePc4qMGqf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After this we need to create two function &lt;code&gt;getCity()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getWeather()&lt;/code&gt;. Using these functions we will fetch the city data and weather_condition of that city from AccuWeather.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;CXhPk82ZAZgV0ngVUWdVBVGePc4qMGqf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*code to fetch the city detail using API*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWeather&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/*code to fetch the weather detail using API*/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task# 2
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;getCity()&lt;/code&gt; and getWeather() we need to define two variables url and query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now initialize these variables as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`?apikey=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;q=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWeather&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://dataservice.accuweather.com/currentconditions/v1/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?apikey=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; to understand the API key, URL and Query please watch the above given video tutorial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, after setting the API key, URLs and Query we need to call the &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; method and pass the &lt;code&gt;rrl&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; as an argument which makes a complete web address resource to access the data. The Fetch API accesses resources across the network. You can make HTTP requests (using GET, POST, and other methods), download, and upload files. &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; starts a request and returns a promise. When the request completes, the promise is resolved with the Response object.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;CXhPk82ZAZgV0ngVUWdVBVGePc4qMGqf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`?apikey=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;q=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWeather&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://dataservice.accuweather.com/currentconditions/v1/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?apikey=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getCity()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getWeather()&lt;/code&gt; are asynchronous functions since they are marked with the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; keyword. As &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; return a promise so you have to wait for it to be resolved that's why we have marked it with an &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;br&gt;
We are returning the &lt;code&gt;0-index&lt;/code&gt; of data &lt;code&gt;return data[0]&lt;/code&gt; because when the promise becomes resolve it will return 2 types of data [0] and [1]. The most accurate one will always be the first one &lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;/code&gt;, so that's why we are returning &lt;code&gt;[0]-index&lt;/code&gt; of data   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we will get a response object in the JSON formate of city details from &lt;code&gt;getCity()&lt;/code&gt; same is the case with &lt;code&gt;getWeather()&lt;/code&gt; as they are returning promises we will deal with these promises in the &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-raw-appjs-endraw-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In app.js we have a async function named &lt;code&gt;updateCity()&lt;/code&gt; as shown below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateCity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWeather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;this function is returning an object having city details and weather details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because the async function always returns a promise so in the code below we are getting the name of the city from the user and passing the city name as an argument to &lt;code&gt;updateCity()&lt;/code&gt; function and as we know &lt;code&gt;updateCity()&lt;/code&gt; function will return a promise so we need to deal with that promise (if the promise is resolved 'then' what? and if it is not resolved 'catch' the error)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCityForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;preventDefault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCityForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCityForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateCity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;city&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Please enter a valid city name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the promise becomes resolved we have to update our user interface to show the details to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the code, above we pass the resolved promise to the &lt;code&gt;updateUI()&lt;/code&gt; function(which will update our User Interface)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateUI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;wDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d-none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d-none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityDetail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;degree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Temperature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Metric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeatherText&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherIconNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;WeatherIcon&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;icon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`icons/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherIconNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.svg`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//from weather condition we will get timestamp &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//So we have to convert it into real time&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LocalObservationDateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toLocaleDateString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curCity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cityDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;EnglishName&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;weatherDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isDayTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curMeridiem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;curMeridiem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;textContent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;updateUI()&lt;/code&gt; function we are simply first getting the sub details(e.g: Temperature, weather condition, etc) of city and weather details and rendering those details on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurry! Our Weather app is ready&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing mathematical formulas in HTML</title>
      <author>Clément Gaudinière</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 13:33:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/clementgaudiniere/writing-mathematical-formulas-in-html-m59</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/clementgaudiniere/writing-mathematical-formulas-in-html-m59</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, today we are going to learn how to write mathematical formulas in HTML, for example, to insert them on a website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-letters-in-a-calculation-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use letters in a calculation ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important thing to learn when doing calculations with letters is to write them in such a way that they can be distinguished from the text. Thanks to HTML you can directly write letters as variables with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. We notice that the letters are slightly italicized and slightly bolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/MWpYdYN?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-exhibitors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The exhibitors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For exhibitors, HTML allows you to directly exhibitors an element without necessarily using a cascading style sheet. To do this, we will use the variable &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
To repeat the previous example :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/ExWaJqV?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-roots"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The roots
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having seen the exponents, we will learn the roots, which are not necessarily easy to write. To achieve it, you must necessarily go through the CSS.&lt;br&gt;
You can for example copy the code below :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/qBrEGZR?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this code is that the horizontal bar of the square root is realized with the border property. So in some cases, if the display window is too small, the formula may be distorted. This is why many sites prefer images to handle square roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-fractions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The fractions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will look at fractions, which can be problematic to create in HTML. There is no ready-made tag to create fractions, so we have to use CSS. The code is available below :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/jOBERJX?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-vectors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The vectors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vectors are particularly useful in physical sciences, you will see later that the code is not very complicated.&lt;br&gt;
For this example, I took the fraction seen before and I applied arrows on the letters.&lt;br&gt;
The vectors for capital letters are designated by the class: &lt;code&gt;oncapital&lt;/code&gt; and the vectors for small letters by the class: &lt;code&gt;onsmall&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/gOmbVRm?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-sum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The sum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a sum in HTML and CSS :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/QWpwemx?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-integrals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The integrals
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an integral in HTML and CSS :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/zYZxgag?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/ksound22/how-to-make-a-counter-application-with-react-usestate-hook-fo7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent times, React.js has become very popular to the extent that almost every frontend developer wants to learn how to use it. Unless they are fanatically [or perhaps passionately] attracted to any other frontend library or framework actually. In React version 16.8 release, hooks were added and since then, working with React has become easier and fun, compared to when class-based components were the de facto method to build a robust web app with the library. In this article, I will guide you through the basics of React useState() hook by making a simple counter application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get up and running with React, we have to set up our development environment by installing React and will be using the CLI (Command Line Interface) tool create-react-app, which is very popular in the React ecosystem. You install create-react-app by running&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm-create-react-app myapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 In our case, myapp is the name of our app. After installation, change the directory to the myapp folder by running&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;cd myapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 I’m using myapp here but you can call your app anything you want. Run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 to start the development server which is always available at port 3000, i.e. &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt;. When the server starts running on port 3000, you see a spinner as shown in the image below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QY9U4Z-w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620476636406/x8aKpggYd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QY9U4Z-w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620476636406/x8aKpggYd.png" alt="reactSpinner.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do some cleanups by removing the test files and everything in the App.js file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start bringing the counter app to life, import the useState hook from React by typing “import React { useState } from ‘react’” and the app.css file by typing “import ‘./app.css’”. Declare a function called App and return a div with Counter App in an h1 tag as shown in the snippet below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Counter App&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also use a fragment instead of div, as I did below&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We must export our App component using ES6 modules, that's why you can see&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;export default App&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 in the last line of the snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you should have Counter App shown in an h1 tag in the browser. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start building the counter app, we have to declare a state with our useState hook. This is normally done by declaring two variables, the state and another to update the state, setState. This is done by using array destructuring and initializing the state to 0.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare state and initialize it to 0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seems I just cheated by placing my Counter App h1 in a div with the class name of title. Don't worry, you'll see why later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In React, there are always multiple ways of doing things, so you can also declare a variable above the App component, initialize it to 0, and pass it into the useState hook. With respect to the counter app, I have declared a count and setCount variable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare state and initialize it to 0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Increase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Decrease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the div [or fragment if you choose to] we returned, we have to add two buttons, one for increasing the counter and the other for decreasing it, then wrap our count variable inside a span tag. You can use the p tag if you want, but I don’t want to get an extra line, so I’m going with span, which does not create an extra line because it is an inline element.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare state and initialize it to 0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Decrease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Increase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To start increasing and decreasing the counter, we need to set up the functions to do that. This is done by passing an onClick function into the two buttons. We can execute the functions inline as shown below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare state and initialize it to 0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Decrease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Increase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right before the return statement, React allows us to write pure JavaScript, so, we can pass the identifier into the onClicks then write the functions before the return statement. I called the two functions handleIncrease and handleDecrease. This is cleaner and easier to read than executing the functions inline. And like I said earlier, there are always multiple ways of doing things in React. I want to show you the ways, so you can choose which works for you best.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Declare state and initialize it to 0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleIncrease&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleDecrease&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleDecrease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Decrease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handleIncrease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Increase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, things should be working correctly, so head over to the browser and start increasing and decreasing Yaay 🙌 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make our little app a little more beautiful, let’s add the styles in the snippet below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100vh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#3498db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2ecc71&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2ecc71&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#3498db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2ecc71&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;used and carefully analyzed a lot of carousel/slider components&lt;/strong&gt;. I summarized that &lt;strong&gt;their issues&lt;/strong&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them do not move the slide as the user swipes on the slide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them do not support mouse dragging to move to the previous or the next slide. With the ones those support mouse emulation, some of them do not properly handle the case where the mouse leaves the carousel, which allow the user to continuously control the carousel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them do not support keyboard navigation (i.e. left, right and tab key).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them cannot be maximized to fullscreen/modal/lightbox. With fullscreen, there is the issue of browser compatibility, i.e. iOS Safari on iPhone does not support the fullscreen API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them do not have an easy solution for building thumbnails. With the ones those have thumbnails, most of the thumbnails cannot be freely scrolled which lead to poor user experience. In addition, most of the thumbnails cannot be lazy loaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them cannot lazy load (and preload) images. With the ones those can lazy load, most of them have transition that traverses the intermediate images when the user goes to a distant slide, which defeat the purpose of lazy loading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them cannot autoplay. With the ones those can autoplay, they cannot auto pause. For example, when the user hits another tab or goes to another app, the autoplay on those carousels do not pause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them do not respect the reduced motion settings by the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them disregard the velocity of the swipe and just set a constant transition duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of their carousels will be in different sizes when the images/slides inside are in different sizes. Some of their transitions are bumpy when their images/slides are in different sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them do not support custom elements in a slide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them cannot be set to display in Right-to-Left (RTL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them disable pinching to zoom, while some others glitch when pinching with 2 fingers. Besides, when the window is zoomed in, most of them still detect for touch swiping to move to the previous, or the next slide, while the intention of most users in this scenario is panning to see other parts of the current slide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them will cause the slides to stuck its position on window resize or on mobile device orientation change, until another user interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them can only have predetermined images (i.e. before the carousel component mounts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of them do not provide a solution for fallback image (for when an image is not available).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them get zoomed in when the user double taps on the control, while the intention of most users in this scenario is to quickly go to the next after the next slide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them remove the left or right button to indicate that there are no more slides in that direction. However, user is likely to click that spot where the button used to be, which causes undesired behaviours e.g. clicking on a link or button which is also at that spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them use the method of cloning the first, and the last slide to achieve looping (or infinite mode). I think that method is not great semantically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of them cannot distinguish a vertical swipe from a horizontal swipe, so that a not exactly vertical swipe moves the slides slightly horizontally; and a not exactly horizontal swipe moves the (document) page slightly vertically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⬇️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write my own &lt;strong&gt;detail-oriented&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;exquisite&lt;/strong&gt; carousel component that is easy to use yet solves/supports all these things above under the hood. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take my understanding of JavaScript events, DOM manipulation, browser APIs, cross-browser compatibility and performance debugging to the next level. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to master React functional components, hooks, custom hooks and reconciliation. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn more, place more care and attention to accessibility. I want to give focus outlines to the right users, support keyboard navigation, support screen reader, and follow &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/"&gt;W3C accessible carousel tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⬇️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My carousel should support: touch, mouse emulation, keyboard navigation, modal (lightbox), thumbnails, autoplay (and auto pause), RTL (right to left for internationalization), image lazy loading (and preloading), responsive images, fallback image, reduced motion settings, instantaneous velocity detection, responsive design, images with any sizes, custom elements in a slide, pinch to zoom, customization and great accessibility. 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(e.g. To solve the last issue (#20) in the list above, my carousel should be able to detect a mostly vertical swipe and then fix the slides horizontally in the carousel. ✅&lt;br&gt;
It should also be able to detect a mostly horizontal swipe and then fix the carousel vertically in the page. ✅)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CSS tweaks for more accessible text</title>
      <author>Nate Watson</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 13:04:58 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/nw/css-tweaks-for-more-accessible-text-ipl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the magical things about the web is that there are numerous ways people will access the sites we build. Whether it's on a phone, in a "reader mode", with images disabled, using a screen-reader or without a mouse, we can (and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;) write code that ensures our sites work beautifully for all these different configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With text particularly, there are a number of browser options that people might use to make content more accessible to them. This ranges from increasing font sizes for more legible text, swapping to a different font completely, or even swapping the text content itself via a translation tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fHCCAAxN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2cxt7ikwayv6zv3jkzz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fHCCAAxN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2cxt7ikwayv6zv3jkzz.png" alt="Increased font size, overridden font families and automatically translated content on a webpage. In all cases the text has enough room, remains readable and maintains bold and italics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code that worsens support for these features is unfortunately common across the web, but goes unnoticed when testing against common accessibility tools such as screen-readers or automated auditors. Fortunately some small changes to how we write CSS can easily bring support for various text-related settings, and once you set things up, it'll quickly become second-nature on all your projects. So let's dive in and have a look at some guidelines for writing accessible CSS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-1-use-relative-font-size-for-nice-font-scaling"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 1: Use relative font size for nice font scaling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Font size is one of the most prominent accessibility settings in most browsers, and a good number of users set it something other than the default. Stats gathered by the Internet Archive in 2018 showed that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773"&gt;just over 3% of their website visitors were using a non-default font size setting&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pretty decent number of people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might be more surprising is that setting your CSS font sizes using pixels (i.e. with the &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt; unit) causes that setting to do absolutely nothing. The problem with pixel units is that they tell the browser exactly how big something should be without allowing for any other factors (like a user having "very large" fonts selected in their browser settings) to come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wn-mYcTz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o588b7cr9qlu1w9lf5p3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wn-mYcTz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o588b7cr9qlu1w9lf5p3.png" alt='Setting the browser font size to "Very large" does not change the size of text that has its font size set using px units - the page looks exactly the same as when the browser font size is set to "Medium"'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where relative font size units really shine. Rather than telling the browser "make my text exactly this big", they instead describe how big the text should be relative to some other element on the page. In the case of the &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; unit, it's relative to the parent element's font size, and for the &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; unit it's relative to the font size of page's top-most, or &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt;, element (almost always the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, that root element's font size comes directly from the browser's font size setting. A browser with its fonts set to "very large" might give pages a root font-size of 24px by default, while one with "very small" might result in a default of 10px.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of pages will override that default by setting a pixel-based font size on the HTML element, for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;/** Don't do this **/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;18px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is often framed as providing a "sensible default", but it prevents the rest of the page from knowing the user's preferred font size. If you're approaching your sites from an accessible perspective, the user preference is almost always the most sensible default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, avoid setting a pixel-based font-size on the HTML (or &lt;code&gt;:root&lt;/code&gt;) element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-font-sizes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting font sizes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've got our root element respecting the browser font size, we need to extend that to all the other other elements on our site. Fortunately with a little bit of math (or an SCSS mixin) we can do this fairly effortlessly in a way that will be invisible to most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing to know is that the default root font size is 16px in most browsers. That means text with its font size set to &lt;code&gt;1rem&lt;/code&gt; will display as 16px (1 times the root font size), &lt;code&gt;2rem&lt;/code&gt; will be 32px, &lt;code&gt;0.5rem&lt;/code&gt; will be 8px, and so on, for users who haven't changed the font size setting. With a little bit of maths, you can convert all your existing pixel sizes to an rem-equivalent:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sizeInRems = sizeInPixels / 16
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Which should let you update any existing font size declarations to be root-relative:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight diff"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gd"&gt;- font-size: 16px;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+ font-size: 1rem;
&lt;/span&gt;
- font-size: 24px;
&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+ font-size: 1.5rem;
&lt;/span&gt;
// and so on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(If you're using SCSS, read on for a mixin that will do some of this for you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not overriding the root font size and switching to relative sizes your text will now scale to match each user's preference - if they've left the setting untouched, everything will look exactly as it did before. But if they've chosen to change the setting - to something larger or something smaller - your website's text will now scale to reflect that preference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VN_5S3hw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6e6zd79luij83tudxhxo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VN_5S3hw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6e6zd79luij83tudxhxo.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-note-on-lineheight"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A note on line-height
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to also switch your line-height values to proportional units, otherwise the values won't scale to match any changes to the calculated font size. For people who increase the root font size, this can cause overlapping lines of text that are pretty difficult to decipher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TpBuf3pD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2w7j68nzokusd53ea5w9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TpBuf3pD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2w7j68nzokusd53ea5w9.png" alt="With default browser settings a pixel-based line height looks perfectly fine. Increasing the browser font size setting causes the size of the letters to increase, but the vertical space between the lines remains unchanged, causing the lines to overlap each other."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is something you should do even if your font-size values are still using pixel units. In addition to settings that change the root font size, most browsers have an option to force a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; font size (usually found under an "advanced font options" menu or similar). This will override any font-size values that are too small, but won't affect any fixed-unit line-heights, resulting in the same overlapping shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to fix this is to switch to unitless line-height values. Line-heights are one of the few CSS properties where it's valid to leave off the units completely (so no &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, no &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, no &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;), with unitless values being interpreted as "the unitless number multiplied by the element's own font size".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-mixin-to-help"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A mixin to help
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're like me, pixel values are how you and the people you work with communicate - design tools usually give values in pixels, the browser inspector shows computed sizes in pixels and they're a unit anyone who stares at a screen for eight hours a day probably has baked into their mind. Thinking in terms of &lt;code&gt;rems&lt;/code&gt; can feel less instinctive, and having to pull out a calculator to convert units is no fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you can write a nice little SCSS mixin (or equivalent in your favourite CSS pre-processor) to do all the hard work for you. The one I use looks something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@mixin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$font-size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;16px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Assuming 16px as the "standard" root font size&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;@if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$line-height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$line-height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Gives a unitless value&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;...and then you can write font sizes using pixels (specifically the pixel size you want to be used when the browser is set to its default font sizes), and the outputted CSS will use the appropriate relative units:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Input:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.paragraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;@include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;24px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Output:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.paragraph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-2-avoid-hardcoded-element-dimensions-give-text-space-to-grow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 2: Avoid hardcoded element dimensions - give text space to grow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you browse the web with increased font sizes, it's common to encounter situations where text is too big for its container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7IptNyJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eu61kiuxotzf2hjvkibc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7IptNyJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eu61kiuxotzf2hjvkibc.png" alt="At default browser font sizes all text on the page fits inside its visual containers - a card sit nicely around the main text and a button has text sitting inside the button's outline. Increasing the font size results in text spilling out the bottom of the card and the button text overlapping the button's borders."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact this isn't just an issue when increasing the font size. Anything that changes the amount of text or dimensions of the letters can make this happen, which includes things like translating a page, using a different typeface (whether intentionally or due to a webfont not loading) or changing the letter spacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of issues like this is hardcoding the dimensions of elements that contain text:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;250px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// html: &amp;lt;button class="Button"&amp;gt;Learn more about the rubber plant&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case our button is going to look bad if the text ever becomes taller than 50px or wider than 250.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're essentially telling the element to not shrink or grow, so anything that doesn't fit will simply overflow out of the element - as shown in the earlier screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often hardcoded dimensions like this can be removed completely or, if you need to prevent the element becoming too small, replaced with min-width/min-height alternatives. If the dimensions play a part in vertically centering the text content, padding is often a suitable alternative:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;250px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;20px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After applying this approach to the button and card in the earlier screenshot, we end up with something much nicer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BcyZg5M_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4n9l7j439edhj7o8w80j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BcyZg5M_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4n9l7j439edhj7o8w80j.png" alt="At both default and increased font sizes all text on the page now fits inside its visual containers. At the larger font size the button text wraps over three lines and the container/outline has grown to accommodate this"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tip-3-specify-web-font-weights-and-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tip 3: Specify web font weights and styles
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the font sizes you specify might be overridden, the font-families named in your CSS may not end up being displayed on the page. There are a number of situations where this will happen: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A webfont fails to load, causing a fallback to be used,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webfonts get blocked completely (for speed, security, to save data, etc.),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user finds a particular typeface easier to read, so uses an extension to force it to be used everywhere,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The page is automatically translated into a language that uses characters not available in the webfont.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to handling these situations gracefully is something most people already do: specifying fallback fonts, or a "font stack":&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;font-family: Fira, Arial, sans-serif;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells the browser to use Fira if it's available, otherwise use Arial, and if that's not available, use the browser's default sans-serif font family. The fallback fonts should be similar to the preferred font, so the page will still look reasonable regardless of which one ends up being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using webfonts there's one more thing you should do to really make your text great, regardless of the font family that ends up being used. Attributes such as font weight and italics often carry additionally (and intentional) meaning, or help differentiate between pieces of text on the page. That makes it important to preserve them no matter which font family gets used. To do this, we need to look at our &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt; declarations. These might look something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Fira'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira.woff')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'woff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira.ttf')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'truetype'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different font weights (bold, light, etc.) and styles (e.g. italics) have to be loaded from separate font files, and therefore require separate @font-face declarations. It's common to see these each given unique names, like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Fira'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira.woff')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'woff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira.ttf')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'truetype'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'FiraBold'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira-bold.woff')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'woff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira-bold.ttf')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'truetype'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Which might be used something like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.bold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FiraBold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue with this approach is that the browser doesn't really know that our 'FiraBold' font is bold - if it fails to load (or is swapped out for a different font), the fallback font will display in a regular weight, no different to the text around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GLb375qq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ef16i8ee5viph7znw743.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GLb375qq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ef16i8ee5viph7znw743.png" alt="Webpage shown with bold text adding emphasis to a warning and italics being used on a Latin word. With fonts overridden the bold and italics text look no different to the text around them."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, we need to be explicit about the weights and styles when declaring and when using our fonts. Rather than giving each variation a unique &lt;code&gt;font-family&lt;/code&gt; value, we should use the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; font-family value across all the variations, and explicitly specify the weight and style of each. For the above example this would look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Fira'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira.woff')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'woff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira.ttf')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'truetype'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@font-face&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'Fira'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;700&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira-bold.woff')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'woff'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url('fira-bold.ttf')&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;'truetype'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final step is to update any CSS where you're using the font variations, so that &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;font-style&lt;/code&gt; CSS properties are used to select variations of the same font-family:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight diff"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;.bold&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;span class="gd"&gt;-   font-family: FiraBold, Arial, sans-serif;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gi"&gt;+   font-family: Fira, Arial, sans-serif;
+   font-weight: 700;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now if the fonts on your page are overridden, fail to load, or are unable to display some text, the weight and style of the text will be preserved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WPQX7G4i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lqlxfawke65cfid95gs1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WPQX7G4i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lqlxfawke65cfid95gs1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Bonus tip: Don't use icon fonts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icons fonts are easy to set-up and use, but they have a number of issues, including breaking completely for users who override fonts (or any other situation where webfonts aren't loaded). That's not to say you shouldn't use icons though (far from it - well used icons are great for accessibility and usability), but approaches that don't involve fonts are the best way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People much smarter than me have written various articles on the topic, so I'm going to delegate to them for this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting numerous different browser configurations can seem like a daunting task, but hopefully these tips have shown that some small changes to how you write CSS can have a big impact. If you're starting a fresh project, try to make these patterns the default! You'll quickly see that they're no extra effort, and visitors to your site will love you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>101 Tips For Being A Great Programmer (&amp; Human)</title>
      <author>iRead Blog</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ireadblog/101-tips-for-being-a-great-programmer-human-23ho</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;1. Get good at Googling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a programmer is all about learning how to search for the answers to your questions. By learning to Google things effectively, you'll save a lot of development time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. Under promise and over deliver&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's better to let your team know a task will take three weeks and deliver in two than the other way around. By under promising and over delivering, you'll build trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Be nice to your designers; they're your friends&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers provide solutions to user pain points. Learn from them and work cohesively to build effective products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Find a mentor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find someone you can learn from and bounce ideas off of. &lt;a href="https://codingcoach.io/"&gt;Coding Coach&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to get started if you need a technical mentor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. Be a mentor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be someone others can learn from and bounce ideas off of. We'd love to have you as a mentor over at &lt;a href="https://codingcoach.io/"&gt;Coding Coach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. Write useful comments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write comments which explain the "why" and not the "what".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;7. Name variables and functions appropriately&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions and variables should accurately denote their purpose, so &lt;code&gt;myCoolFunction&lt;/code&gt; won't fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;8. Take vacations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all need time to de-compress. Take that trip you've been wanting. Your brain and your co-workers will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;9. Delete unused code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No reason to accrue more technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;10. Learn to read code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading code is an undervalued skill, but an invaluable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;11. Establish a healthy work/life balance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need time to de-compress after a long workday. Shut off work notifications, remove apps off your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VqSUBCSo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fv2vh91wlhe9dh046mub.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x4XSmZ9x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VqSUBCSo--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fv2vh91wlhe9dh046mub.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;12. Only schedule necessary meetings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can it be solved in an email or a Slack message? If so, avoid a meeting. If not, be conscious of the duration. Aim for less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;13. Pair program&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair programming allows you to play the role of both teacher and student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;14. Write great emails&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to capture your audience in your emails by being succinct yet clear. Nobody wants to read your four-page email Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;15. Get involved in the community&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with like-minded people will motivate you to push through the lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;16. Clean up your branches&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean up your version control branches like you'd clean your house before your in-laws came for a visit. If you don't need it, discard it; don't just throw it in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;17. Don't gate keep&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be inclusive. Don't tell others they aren't good enough to be in the industry. Everyone has value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;18. Keep learning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've chosen a profession that requires continuous learning. Learn to love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;19. Don't give up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won't always be easy. But we all started at the same place. You can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;20. Take tasks that scare you&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't scare you, it isn't going to help you grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;21. Clarify requirements before starting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should understand the acceptance criteria before delving into writing the code. It will save you time and pain later down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;22. Have a toolbox&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a set of tools which you know inside-and-out. Know which tools serve which purpose and when a project can benefit from using one over another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;23. Learn to love constructive criticism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask trusted colleagues and friends for constructive criticism. It will help you grow as a programmer and as a human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;24. Be open-minded&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology changes, and it changes quickly. Don't oppose new technology; learn it and then form an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;25. Stay relevant&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay up-to-date on the latest tech news by following publications, blogs, podcasts, and tech news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;26. Focus on problem solving&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong problem solving skills can conquer any problem. Hone in on what it takes to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;27. Stay humble&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what title you hold or what company you work form, stay humble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RnwQ4J59--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nhgfS-7z--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3skzkor6amr46291uvtp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RnwQ4J59--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nhgfS-7z--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3skzkor6amr46291uvtp.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;28. Learn to give a great presentation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how to captivate your audience and give effective presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;29. Examine all solutions before jumping in&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't jump straight into the first possible solution. Examine all paths before delving into the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;30. Find your niche&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many divisions within the tech industry. Find the area that interests you most and become an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;31. Develop good habits&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to build consistent, and healthy, habits such as removing distractions, time-boxing tasks, being present in meetings, and starting with the most important task first. It might take some getting used to but it will be worth it in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;32. Learn to debug&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explore the browser debugger tools. Learn the ins-and-outs of debugging with your IDE. By learning the most effective methods for debugging a problem and tracing errors, you'll be able to solve even the most difficult bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;33. Exercise your current skills&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because you currently know a skill doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise it. Skills fade with time unless consciously improved upon, and this industry evolves so rapidly it's important to keep practicing. Get out of the mindset that "I've always done it this way" and into the mindset of "Is there a better way to do this?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because you've got a six pack now, doesn't mean you can eat a 🍩 a day and stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;34. Understand the why&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be times when you have to voice your opinion, so it's important to understand the why behind it. Why is solution A better than solution B? Provide a valid argument and your opinions will be much more sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;35. Know your worth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a commodity, and should be paid appropriately. Be aware of the industry averages in your geographic location. If you're making less money, it's time to have a chat with your manager. Go after what you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;36. Don't be afraid to ask for help&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're stuck on a problem and spending too much time searching for a solution, it's time to ask for help. We're all human. We all need help. There is no shame in reaching out to a colleague for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;37. Learn to learn&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People learn in different ways. Some learn best through video tutorials, others through reading a book. Figure out your learning style and practice it diligently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;38. Be kind&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be times when you're asked to provide feedback on a colleague. Be kind. You can voice your opinions about Deborah's lack of initiative without ripping her to shreds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;39. Take breaks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's nearly impossible to spend 8 consecutive hours coding. You'll burn out quickly and make a lot of mistakes. So set a timer to remind yourself to stop and take a break. Go for a walk. Get a coffee with a colleague. Stepping away from the screen will positively impact your productivity and the quality of your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;40. Track your progress&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to code takes time and can be extremely disheartening when you don't see progress. So it's important to track your achievements and progress towards your goals. Keep a small list next to your computer and each time you achieve something, write it down, no matter how small. Atomic achievements compound to much larger rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;41. Don't rely on a framework or library&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn the nuances of a language better than the ins-and-outs of a framework or library. You don't necessarily need to learn one before another, but understanding why a framework or library works the way it does will help you write cleaner and more performant code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;42. Learn to love code reviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having someone read and analyze your code can be terrifying, but can offer you invaluable feedback which will make you a better programmer. You should also work on your ability to conduct a good code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;43. Learn about tangential spaces&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn some basics about tangential spaces, such as design, marketing, frontend development or backend development. It will help you to become a more well-rounded programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;44. Don't choose the comfortable technology; choose the right one&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each project will have different needs, and as such we must choose the right tools for the job. Although it's comfortable to choose technologies you've worked with previously, if they don't suit the needs of the project, alternatives should be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;45. Take responsibility for your mistakes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All humans make mistakes and you will many many throughout your career. Thus it's important to own up and take responsibility when you've made a mistake. It will build trust with your team members and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;46. Review your own code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before opening a pull request, review your own code. If this were the work of a colleague, what comments would you make? It's important to first try to diagnose problems or mistakes before requesting a code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;47. Learn from your failures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure is simply not achieving the expected outcome, and is not necessarily a bad thing. We all have many failures during the course of our careers. Learn from your downfalls. What can you do differently next time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;48. Recognize your weaknesses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get to know yourself. What are your weaknesses? Maybe you always forget to update the tests before pushing. Or maybe you are really bad at replying to emails. Learn your weaknesses so you can actively work to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;49. Stay curious&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This industry is ever-evolving, so curiosity will be important. If you don't understand something, be it a project requirement or a line of code, speak up. Nobody will criticize you for asking for clarification and you'll create better code as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Qd0iPY9Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ypw1fzcI--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qzhic8yqs0pu28bo78lf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Qd0iPY9Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ypw1fzcI--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qzhic8yqs0pu28bo78lf.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;50. Don't try to learn everything&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an infinity pool of knowledge in the world and it is simply impossible to conquer it all. Pick several topics to master and leave the rest be. You can acquire working or tangential knowledge about other areas, but you cannot possibly master everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;51. Kill your darlings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because you write some code doesn't mean you need t be emotionally attached to it. Nobody likes their work being thrown out, but code has a life cycle, so there's no need to be territorial about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;52. Have your team's back&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good teams have each others' backs. This creates a safe space to try new things without fear of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;53. Find inspiration in the community&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a few people in the industry you admire. It will inspire you to keep working on your projects or try new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;54. Value your work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how much experience you have or what your job title is, your work has value. Give it the value it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;55. Disable distractions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning off Slack notifications, text messages, emails, and social media will help you focus and maximize your workday.Jerry won't fall apart if it takes you 30 minutes to respond to his message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;56. Be supportive&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try and support your team members whether that's by attending an important presentation or helping them if they get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;57. Give credit where credit is due&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone does great work, tell them. Positive re-enforcement is a great way to build trust with your team members and help their careers. They'll be more likely to help you along as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;58. Test your code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests are important. Unit tests, regression tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests. Test your code and your product will be much more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;59. Plan out your approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you receive a new feature request or get a new bug ticket, first plan your attack. What do you need to solve this problem or develop this feature? Taking even just a few minutes to plan your attack can save you hours of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;60. Learn to pseudocode&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pseudocoding is a great skill to have because it allows you to think through complex problems without wasting time writing lines of code. Write an approach down on paper, run through different test cases and see where the pitfalls are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;61. Keep track of your achievements&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you win an award at work, write it down. If you develop a crucial feature, write it down. You'll create a backlog of things which can aid with a promotion or boost your morale on a tough day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;62. Learn programming foundations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn some basic sorting and searching algorithms and data structures. These are language-agnostic and can help you solve problems across languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;63. Choose technology for longevity &amp;amp; maintainability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it's fun to test out the newest technologies, pick those which will be easy to maintain within an enterprise application. Your team will thank you for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;64. Learn design patterns&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design patterns are useful tools for architecting code. You may not need them for every project, but having a basic understanding of them will help scaffold out larger applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;65. Reduce ambiguity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing convoluted code which shows off your snazzy programming skills, aim for readability and simplicity. This will make it easier for your team members to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l3HXm7Wr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fX3cKq9j--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6rg8pvj8ezhreshjjx6o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l3HXm7Wr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fX3cKq9j--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6rg8pvj8ezhreshjjx6o.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;66. Pay off technical debt&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical debt can have massive performance implications, so if you're able to refactor, you should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;67. Ship often&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of shipping a massive upgrade once every month, ship more frequently with smaller changelogs. You're less likely to introduce bugs and breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;68. Commit early and often&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Committing early and committing often is the best way to ensure that your work remains clean and also reduces the stress of accidentally reverting important changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;69. Learn when to ask for help&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only should you not be afraid to ask for help, but you should learn when to ask for help. You should always try to solve a problem before asking for help, and keep track of the things you try. But when you've been stumped by a simple problem for over an hour, the cost outweighs the benefit, and you should reach out to a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;70. Ask effective questions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asking a question, try to be as specific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;71. Get feedback on unfinished work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your work doesn't need to be finished for you to get feedback. If you're uncertain of the direction, ask a trusted colleague to review the validity of your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;72. Read documentation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation is the purest source of truth about a technology, so learning to read it can quickly help you to become an expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;73. Try all the things&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is stopping you from trying a solution to a problem. What do you have to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;74. Speak up in meetings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ideas and opinions are valuable so participating in meetings will help you develop a rapport with your team as well as management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;75. Collaborate cross-team&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get an opportunity to with with another team in your company, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;76. Have passion projects&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you work 40 hours a week, it's important to take time for passion projects. They help you reinvigorate your love of programming and try new technologies you might not have access to at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;77. Define your career goals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to have an idea of your ideal trajectory for your career. If you don't, you're trying to shoot an arrow without having a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vvZYzjT7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SPitWbzG--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fjqq1ghzpz4qqcjhoew6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vvZYzjT7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SPitWbzG--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/fjqq1ghzpz4qqcjhoew6.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;78. Get involved in the conversation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment on blogs, participate in Twitter threads. Engage with the community. You'll learn a lot more from being an active bystander than a wallflower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;79. Prioritize tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to prioritize your tasks will help you enhance your productivity. Keep an active to-do list of immediate daily tasks as well as longer-term tasks and order them by most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;80. Don't overlook the details&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details can make a big difference in a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;81. Trust your teammates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your teammates were hired for their skills. Use them and trust them to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;82. Learn to delegate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're in a leadership position, learn how to delegate effectively. It will save you time and frustration. You cannot do it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;83. Don't compare yourself to others&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;84. Surround yourself with allies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to program will be a long, and not always easy, journey. Surround yourself with the people who build you up and encourage you to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;85. Don't start for scale&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting for scale is a surefire way to become overwhelmed. Build with scalability in mind, but don't start scaling until you need it. This way you don't overwhelm your team with unnecessary bloat, but you maintain the ability to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;86. Weigh performance implications&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a cool, new technology you should weigh the performance implications of doing so. Could you implement something similar without taking a performance hit? If so, you may want to re-think your approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;87. Don't discriminate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't discriminate against new technologies or ideas. Be open-minded about the possibility of learning new skills. Also don't discriminate against people. We all deserve respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;88. Apply for jobs you aren't qualified for&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will never meet every requirement for a job. So take a chance and apply! What do you have to lose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;89. Modularize your code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could write all of your code in one long file, but this isn't maintainable. By modularizing, we ensure that our code is easily digestible and testable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;90. Don't JUST copy and paste&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're going to copy and paste a solution from Stack Overflow, you should understand &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what it does. Be intentional about the code you choose to introduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gkH5eEB---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YyPmerE5--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uts4vd8ab10x8oct7fwb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gkH5eEB---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YyPmerE5--/c_limit%252Cf_auto%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%252Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uts4vd8ab10x8oct7fwb.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;91. Create an inspiring environment/setup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll be much more motivated to work if you enjoy your workspace and technical setup. Make it you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;92. Remember where you came from&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all started from the same place. As your skills and your job titles evolve, don't forget where you came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;93. Try to remain optimistic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something goes wrong, try and be optimistic. Tomorrow is a new day. Optimism will help your team dynamic and your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;94. Continually re-assess your workflow&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because something works now doesn't mean it always will. Re-evaluate your workflow and make adjustments where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;95. Learn how to work from home&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to work from home, learn to do so effectively. Find a separate office space, devoid of distractions. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/boneskull/pro-tips-for-devs-working-at-home-3b63"&gt;Boneskull&lt;/a&gt; wrote a great article on working from home you should check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;96. Code for accessibility&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility isn't an afterthought, and it doesn't have to be difficult. Everyone should be able to use your products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;97. Honor your commitments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you tell someone you'll deliver something by a certain date, honor that commitment. And if you can no longer make the deadline, speak up early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;98. Be proactive&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have some extra bandwidth, find a task to help your team! They'll be thankful you were proactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;99. Build an amazing portfolio&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great portfolio sets you apart from the crowd. Use this as a chance to show off your programming and design skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;100. Remember why you love programming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You got into this profession because it sparked an interest. If you're getting frustrated and resentful, take a break. Give yourself space to reignite your passion for programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;101 Share your knowledge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you learn something cool, share it! Present at a local meetup or conference. Teach your coworker or mentee during lunch. Sharing your knowledge reinforces your knowledge while spreading the wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it! I hope you enjoyed these tips for being a great programmer (and human)! Add yours if you have any.&lt;/p&gt;
