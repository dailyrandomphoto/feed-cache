      <title>Learning Python- Intermediate course: Day 28, Summary of the week</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-28-summary-of-the-week-1ppf</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-of-the-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary of the week
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-25-buttons-entry-and-textboxes-2d0n"&gt;Day 25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We covered the entry, button and the text widget. The &lt;strong&gt;button&lt;/strong&gt; widget is a simple button which executes a action when clicked on. &lt;code&gt;button=tk.Button(form,text="Press Me",command=cmd)&lt;/code&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;entry widget&lt;/strong&gt; is a widget which accepts a single line input (text) from the user. &lt;code&gt;entry = tk.Entry(parent)&lt;/code&gt;. The value of the text can be obtained using the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; function. &lt;strong&gt;Textboxes&lt;/strong&gt; are just the same as entry widgets, the only difference is that we can add multiple lines to it. Just replace 'Entry' by 'Text' and you are done! Using the height and width attributes, we can set the number of input characters in each line. for the textbox. &lt;code&gt;text=TB1.get(1.0, "end-1c")&lt;/code&gt; returns the value of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-26-password-manager-tkinter-17p9"&gt;Day 26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We practiced the widgets learnt in the previous part by building a password management application. The application consists of two entry widgets and one button widget. In order to hide the password, we can use the show() attribute of the entry widget. &lt;code&gt;TB1=tk.Entry(form,width = 20,show="*")&lt;/code&gt; This hides the passwords in the widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/aatmaj/learning-python-intermediate-course-day-27-entry-keypress-event-5d15"&gt;Day 27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We learnt about the keypress event. The keypress event is run when the user presses a key on the entry widget. In this part, we made a spyware application to scan the keys typed into the entry widget. Be sure to check the program later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epilogue&lt;/em&gt;- We all know that neither me nor you have ever seen each other. Learning in remote environment is a difficult, and teaching is perhaps even more difficult. Teaching is never a one-way process. When a teacher teaches with pattern, he/she expects that the student must respond back. Either with doubts, remarks or nods of approval. &lt;br&gt;
But friends, being remote, we cannot interact with each other. The only way we can connect is through the comments below. So I urge everyone to comment on the posts. Currently I am in doubt whether you all are understanding me or not. Should I speed up the pace or maybe explain more clearly? I am not getting any feedback from you. Any doubts, discussions, remarks or even a simple hi from you is a great source of motivation for me. So I look forward to your comments below...😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who have not yet made account in Dev.to, you can have a free easy sign-up using your mail or GitHub accounts. I would suggest the budding developers to create your GitHub free account right away. You would require to register sooner or later anyways&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥&lt;br&gt;
Next day will begin from Tuesday📅&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contributing to The Open Source Community! </title>
      <author>Luigi Zaccagnini</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:59:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/contributing-to-the-open-source-community-fp7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/contributing-to-the-open-source-community-fp7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I start this blog post I would like to thank the Dev team for shouting me out on Twitter! It meant a lot and I truly appreciate it! Now, welcome to my blog post about me contributing to another developers open source project and how you can possibly find a fun project to work on as well! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-a-project-to-work-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding a Project to Work on
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this open source project by networking through my classes Slack to look for a partner. I ended up finding &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/drew5494"&gt;@drew5494&lt;/a&gt;
 who was also writing a static site generator in C++. If you are looking for a project to work on, you should try finding one on &lt;a href="https://github.com/trending"&gt;GitHub Trending&lt;/a&gt; or you can try commenting your favourite open source project for others to find! I was a little nervous to test and review a project in a language that I don't program in very often but, nothing wrong with broadening your horizon! Open source should be filled with learning and fun so don’t be afraid to try new things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-and-reviewing-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing and Reviewing Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I had to do a little review of C++ so I could get a stronger understanding of the code. Once I had a grasp of the code I conducted some tests to see if the features would work or break under certain situations. I noticed that I found bugs/problems a lot faster than I usually would in my own code. This experience really showed me that not only is it important to have your code reviewed but, having a fresh brain while reviewing projects makes debugging and testing one million times easier! Best advice I have read within the tech community was “If you are stuck, go for a walk and try again” it will save you the ten hours of staring at a screen because of a typo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some problems I found while reviewing were:&lt;br&gt;
*README didn’t contain tool features or examples &lt;br&gt;
*The input flag did not work with directories&lt;br&gt;
*The input flag work with text files only in the same directory of the executable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-review-on-octo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Review On Octo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting my code reviewed was very scary at first. Putting your code out in the open can be daunting but, will help you improve your skills as a developer. The one issue that surprised me the most was the version flag not working. It surprised me not because of why it did not work but, why did it work on my machine? The problem was I had a string in my version variable in my package.json. I was able to fix it by just removing the string and creating a custom yargs statement. The only other issue reported on my project was adding liquid tag support to the tool. That feature was recommended on my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/open-source-static-site-generator-3953"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt; post by &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/pandademic"&gt;@pandademic&lt;/a&gt;
 . Thanks a lot for the recommendation! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I have learned that testing and reviewing is imperative for the growth of a developer. Testing and reviewing helps developers learn new things, understand how to work with other developers and allows developers to try new things! What are some of your first issues you worked on in an open source project? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the links to both repository issues:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/LuigiZaccagnini/octo/issues"&gt;Octo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Working together in Open Source Projects</title>
      <author>Emily</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:43:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hphan9/work-together-in-open-source-project-3kek</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hphan9/work-together-in-open-source-project-3kek</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-start"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The start
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the features of my command line application tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg"&gt;shinny-ssg&lt;/a&gt;, I was working with Diana to cross-check the source code of our projects. In general, we have to check for bugs, suggest improvement, and file issues on Github. &lt;br&gt;
We both use C# and .NetCore 3.1 to create the projects and therefore, the experience was quite exciting and I definitely learned a lot.&lt;br&gt;
It is just a pleasure to work with Diana. I have known her previously from my database and web classese and knew that she is such a hard working and bright girl. In addition, Diana worked at the company which I am now doing the internship at. She has used C# for a long time and have great knowledge about it. This was very evident from her code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested her application &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/glazed-donut"&gt;glazed-donut&lt;/a&gt; with all test cases and her code nailed it. All the features worked as expected and it generated appropriate messages to the users when there were any errors/exception. The only problem I could find about it is in &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbelokon/glazed-donut/issues/3"&gt;generateHTML method &lt;/a&gt;, which she should have replaced the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br\&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with white space. Other than that, just a few minor typos on the read me file, but nothing major. &lt;br&gt;
When she reviewed my code and tested my app, I appreciated that she really spent the time to check every detail, giving me very sound advice and helped me file bugs which I did not find before. &lt;br&gt;
First, she mentioned the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg/issues/1"&gt;naming convention&lt;/a&gt; in C# and explained in details the good practices in the industry. Second, she found a &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg/issues/2"&gt;bug in my Page class&lt;/a&gt; which created an extra &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. Third, my &lt;a href="https://github.com/hphan9/shinny-ssg/issues/4"&gt;exception handling&lt;/a&gt; was not good enough and she guided me to make it better. &lt;br&gt;
In the end, I am able to fix most of the issues but I need more time to improve the code and make it flawless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thought"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thought
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated Diana for reviewing my code so thoroughly. I found that testing and reviewing code is great way to learn and improve your knowledge/code design.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing code review</title>
      <author>TueNguyen2911</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:30:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tuenguyen2911_67/doing-code-review-pg7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tuenguyen2911_67/doing-code-review-pg7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing my static site generation program, I partnered up with &lt;a href="https://dev.to/oliverpham"&gt;Oliver Pham&lt;/a&gt; so that we could both review each other's code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issues-with-my-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issues with my code:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of issues can be viewed &lt;a href="https://github.com/TueNguyen2911/tue-1st-ssg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My program was not perfect in many ways, I expected it to have some flaws which turned out to be true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues weren't severed, the program still functioned fine, but the HTML files generated had quite a few HTML markdown errors and the &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; command didn't print enough information. After some discussions, Oliver managed to fixed those issues easily, he also caused &lt;a href="https://github.com/TueNguyen2911/tue-1st-ssg/issues/5"&gt;a bug&lt;/a&gt;  but quickly patched it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-contribution-to-my-partners-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My contribution to my partner's code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a look at its issues &lt;a href="https://github.com/oliver-pham/silkie/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited to look at his Python code for the same program which is a language I haven't tried. Luckily, Python is not a hard language to jump into and his code was readable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first by I found was that his program couldn't open files encoded in &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt; because Windows' default is &lt;code&gt;Windows-1252&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second bug was caused by the input path having the current path, ex: &lt;code&gt;./file.txt&lt;/code&gt;, the program couldn't parse the title from such file path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, one of his functions that parses title from the text file(s) was a bit confusing so I shortened it using some regular expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity actually gave me more joy and more experience collaborating, I thought it was gonna hard as I was giving away my code for another person to criticize. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it motivated me to test his program with a view to returning his help finding fault in my program, I wouldn't have this experience doing solo. Also, getting to actually use Github, making pull requests, talking to other devs, learning more about Python are valuable lessons to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learnings from release 0.1</title>
      <author>Ritik Bheda</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:20:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ritikbheda/learnings-from-release-0-1-14no</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ritikbheda/learnings-from-release-0-1-14no</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I am back and this week I have my experience and learnings to share on a project I worked this week. The project was to release version 0.0.1 of a Static Site Generator tool I am making for my course at Seneca College. The tool can take commandline input of text files or folders and generate html files for the same. More information about the tool and its uses can found in this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg-release-0-0-1-1mlp"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really great experience working on this project as I got a profound understanding on commandline tools, npm and Node.js development. The process also gave me a better experience using git and GitHub. Later, I found an amazing(luckily) partner &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067"&gt;Tuan Tan&lt;/a&gt; who is highly skilled at backend development and to be more specific, Node.js development. We met on our class Slack channel where he posted that he is looking for a partner and then I approached him for the same. We both helped each other by reviewing and testing each others code and finding possible areas of improvement on each others project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvising-tuans-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improvising Tuan's Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it was very new for me to test review someone’s code as I was doing it for the first time, but I found myself comfortable and confident enough to test his work after reading this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067/build-a-command-line-tool-that-converts-txt-to-html-3je5"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in which he explains how to use his tool. The tool documentation being so good, it was easy for me to install, run and test in my local machine. Well, everything worked perfectly and according to the requirements, and that did not surprise me, but the surprising part was it was done so amazingly that it gave a hard time to find 3 issues in the code! &lt;br&gt;
The 2 of the 3 issues I found were related to commandline options and the third one was related to version. The options part had an &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/5"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; that the output on the terminal was not align which I according to me, if improvised can give a better look of using the whole tools. The second &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/3"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; regarding options was that the tool was using commandline arguments as program variables instead of options. Improving this can make the work easier for the developer and can also make the work more organized. The final &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/4"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was related to the tool version. The program was not able to pick the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file which gave an error when I tried seeing the version number through the commandline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issues-in-my-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issues in my Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also helped me in reviewing and testing my code. I was eager for him creating issues so that I can work on them and improve my tool. His issues did not surprise me as I was sure I might have made a few mistakes during the development.&lt;br&gt;
He was able to find 3 issues in my code as well! He found issues of a typo, picking version from the file and program giving errors in special cases. I had a typing mistake in my code where I misspelled ‘successfully’ to ‘successfullly’. The issue can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The second &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/1"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was versioning related as he suggested me to pick the program version from package.json which could reduce programmers work manually updating it in every file that uses it. And the last &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/3"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; he found was input file/folder related in which he entered a file which did not exist. Instead of my program warning the user, it created an empty folder which was never expected. I later worked on all the 3 issues and resolved them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-takeaways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that everyone has different thinking style and approach to a problem. I learned how my thinking style affects the problem I am working on. I also learned from his experience on the projects testing and reviewing about Node.js development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find the project and lab related these links helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSG for generating html</title>
      <author>jsong89</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:17:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/ssg-for-generating-html-2eib</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/ssg-for-generating-html-2eib</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSD600&lt;/strong&gt; feels like a subject that composes a program (?) on a specific topic by mobilizing everything that has been learned so far. In the first week, instructions were released to create release 0.1, and I tried to tailor the code as best as possible to the requirements of that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating the api, I chose node js, which I was most confident and used the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I created a repository in Git and named it "jun-ssg" after me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-ssg-for-text-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The SSG for text file!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source Project 0.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jun-ssg is a simple html generator. You can extract your file contents and put them as HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before start to use&lt;br&gt;
After downloaded files delete the package-lock.json&lt;br&gt;
run "npm install" at terminal&lt;br&gt;
You can dowload and run the repository files -node src/app.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can run by npm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm i -g &lt;a href="https://github.com/juuuuuuun/jun-ssg.git"&gt;https://github.com/juuuuuuun/jun-ssg.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example statements&lt;br&gt;
Options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-i, --input Input a file or a directory [string] [required]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-o, --output Specify the output directory [string]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-s, --stylesheet Import css URL [string]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-v, --version Show version number [boolean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-h, --help Show usage information [boolean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples: After install my package, jun-ssg -i 'Silver Blaze.txt'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning my repository&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UsCPbKK3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ljpioxhj5y1x77sau6w.png" alt="1"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After complete the cloning terminal should show like this&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i65RlVkj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4wgsq3p2ukftnzbuasl.png" alt="2"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the dir location to the cloned folder&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UrylB25a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/697udi8h3vbuex6gz8wf.png" alt="3"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run "npm install" to use pre-set npm modules&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUSQQDlY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q49q02gjqxz6momm2ojl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUSQQDlY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q49q02gjqxz6momm2ojl.png" alt="4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to run "node src/app.js" if everything is fine the terminal should show how to use this api.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUx3bS3r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fp6v4utel61e3thoo89t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUx3bS3r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fp6v4utel61e3thoo89t.png" alt="5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type any command which is set, but in this case will run -input option type "node src/app.js -i 'Sherlock-Holmes-Selected-Stories'".&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1zG6JxgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vegjcm7qwhs3441u5hd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1zG6JxgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vegjcm7qwhs3441u5hd.png" alt="6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check generated htmls.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mkg01tA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vizppsak96u3s5o07pq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mkg01tA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vizppsak96u3s5o07pq.png" alt="7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, you can apply any css stylesheet like this way.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajgbtADk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8saqdx6ipjtotrgu794.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajgbtADk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8saqdx6ipjtotrgu794.png" alt="8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can see the htmls with nice design :)&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvNbbVH2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nvevrr4lui0wllrcheq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvNbbVH2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nvevrr4lui0wllrcheq.png" alt="9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Review nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;Lock EJF351BLK</title>
      <author>Hana Do</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 02:41:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hanado2801/review-noi-chien-khong-dau-locklock-ejf351blk-185p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hanado2801/review-noi-chien-khong-dau-locklock-ejf351blk-185p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://locknlockvietnam.com.vn/noi-chien-khong-dau/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ngay từ khi xuất hiện đã trở thành món đồ không thể thiếu trong bếp của mỗi gia đình. Với công nghệ làm chín hiện đại, nồi chiên Lock&amp;amp;Lock dầu giúp người dùng được thỏa mãn đam mê thưởng thức những món đồ chiên rán mà không phải hấp thụ quá nhiều chất béo từ dầu mỡ. Trong đó, nổi bật là sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK được đánh giá là một trong những sản phẩm được ưa chuộng nhất của thương hiệu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-n%E1%BB%93i-chi%C3%AAn-kh%C3%B4ng-d%E1%BA%A7u-lockamplock-ejf351blk-c%C3%B3-%C4%91%C3%A1ng-s%E1%BB%AD-d%E1%BB%A5ng"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK có đáng sử dụng?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Để đánh giá sản phẩm có tốt hay không, trước tiên hãy cùng chúng tôi tìm hiểu những tính năng, đặc điểm của sản phẩm nhé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-v%E1%BB%81-thi%E1%BA%BFt-k%E1%BA%BF"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.1. Về thiết kế&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sản phẩm được thiết kế với hình bầu dục to tròn. Chất liệu sản phẩm được làm từ nhựa PP cao cấp, có khả năng chịu lực và chịu nhiệt tốt. Với chất liệu nhựa mà màu sắc chủ đạo là đem bóng, nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK sở hữu một vẻ ngoài sang trọng, hiện đại và trang nhã, phù hợp với mọi không gian bếp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-c%C3%B4ng-su%E1%BA%A5t-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.2. Công suất sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thông thường với các thiết bị sử dụng điện thì dung tích càng lớn, lượng điện năng tiêu thụ sẽ càng nhiều, gây tốn điện năng. Tuy nhiên, với sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK, công suất nồi chỉ 1800 W với dung tích hơn 5L, tiết kiệm điện năng hơn rất nhiều so với các thiết bị điện cùng loại như bếp nướng, bếp điện từ, nồi cơm điện, lò nướng,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQUqVkMv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uixzrgsxxtob7ltwtush.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQUqVkMv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uixzrgsxxtob7ltwtush.jpg" alt="Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock phiên bản EJF351BLK có đáng sử dụng?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-thi%E1%BA%BFt-k%E1%BA%BF-l%C3%B2ng-n%E1%BB%93i"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.3. Thiết kế lòng nồi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lòng nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK được thiết kế vô cùng thông minh. Nó có khả năng tháo rời ra dễ dàng khỏi giỏ chiên chỉ bằng một cái chạm nhẹ ở phần tay cầm. Điều này giúp cho việc sắp xếp thực phẩm và việc vệ sinh nồi sau nấu dễ dàng hơn rất nhiều. Đây là ưu điểm vô cùng tiện lợi cho người sử dụng mà chiếc nồi này sở hữu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#14-c%C3%B4ng-ngh%E1%BB%87-chi%C3%AAn-ch%C3%A2n-kh%C3%B4ng-ti%C3%AAn-ti%E1%BA%BFn-h%C3%A0ng-%C4%91%E1%BA%A7u-hi%E1%BB%87n-nay"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.4. Công nghệ chiên chân không tiên tiến hàng đầu hiện nay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock phiên bản EJF351BLK sử dụng công nghệ chiên chân không kết hợp cùng công nghệ Rapid Air hiện đại, giúp nhiệt độ có thể nóng lên tới 360 độ, làm thực phẩm được chín đều, giữ được hương vị thơm ngon, nguyên vị mà không hề đọng lại dầu mỡ. Bên cạnh đó, luồng khí nóng bên trong nồi cùng với thiết kế quạt thổi sẽ giúp hơi nóng được tải đều và rộng hơn trong lòng nồi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Như vậy, với chiếc nồi chiên không dầu này, người dùng sẽ không còn phải lo về việc hấp thụ quá nhiều dầu mỡ như cách chiên rán thông thường. Đổi lại, bạn vẫn sẽ được thưởng thức những món ăn ngon mà không hề phải sử dụng chút dầu mỡ nào. Điều này cực kỳ có lợi cho sức khỏe của người sử dụng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#15-dung-t%C3%ADch-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.5. Dung tích sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dung tích của sản phẩm cũng là một trong những ưu thế mà chiếc nồi chiên EJF351BLK có được. Sản phẩm có dung tích lớn lên tới 5.2L. Điều này đồng nghĩa với việc người dùng có thể chế biến lượng lớn thức ăn, đủ phục vụ cho gia đình đông từ 6-8 người. Hoặc với những gia đình ít người nhưng thích ăn đồ chiên, nướng, đây cũng chính là chiếc nồi cực kỳ phù hợp và tiện dụng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q4f4X8f2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/talzjmt7bvsa77yqe3i3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q4f4X8f2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/talzjmt7bvsa77yqe3i3.jpg" alt="Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK sở hữu nhiều tính năng nổi bật"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#16-t%C3%ADnh-n%C4%83ng-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.6. Tính năng sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thay vì phải vệ sinh bằng các dung dịch chuyên dụng, nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK có thể dễ dàng tháo rời để rửa sạch bằng nước rửa chén thông thường. Ngoài ra, bạn cũng có thể cho phần lòng nồi vào máy rửa chén để rửa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sản phẩm còn được tích hợp nhiều chức năng ưu việt khác như: Có thể cài sẵn thời gian nấu lên tới 30 phút, có thể tự do điều khiển nhiệt độ cho phù hợp với từng giai đoạn của món ăn, nhiệt độ tối đa lên tới 200 độ C nên có thể dùng để nướng bánh, rau củ, tôm cua, thịt cá, hải sản,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-%C6%B0u-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m-c%E1%BB%A7a-n%E1%BB%93i-chi%C3%AAn-kh%C3%B4ng-d%E1%BA%A7u-ejf351blk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Ưu nhược điểm của nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sau đây, hãy cùng chúng tôi phân tích những điểm nổi trội và còn cần cải thiện của sản phẩm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#21-v%E1%BB%81-%C6%B0u-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;2.1. Về ưu điểm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiếc nồi sẽ giúp bạn tiết kiệm thời gian nấu nướng với chế độ cài sẵn giờ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hạn chế hấp thụ dầu mỡ, chất béo có hại cho sức khỏe mà vẫn được thưởng thức các món ăn chiên, nướng ngon, đảm bảo sức khỏe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hạn chế nguy cơ đồ ăn bị cháy khét, gây hại cho sức khỏe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiết kiệm dầu mỡ vì gần như không sử dụng đế&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Người dùng sẽ hoàn toàn thoát khỏi nỗi ám ảnh dọn dẹp bãi chiến trường sau khi nấu ăn. Việc vệ sinh vô cùng đơn giản vì khay nồi được lót một lớp chống dính, thiết kế khau và rá chiên rời nhau lại không bị bắn như khi dùng chảo hay lò nướng nên việc vệ sinh dễ dàng, nhanh chóng hơn rất nhiều&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dung tích nồi lớn có thể sử dụng cho các gia đình đông thành viên&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Công nghệ chiên thông minh giúp thực phẩm chín đều, tươi ngon, giữ được nguyên vị món ăn, không bị ám mùi khói&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nhiệt độ tối đa lên tới 200 độ và có thể cài thời gian nấu tự động trong 30 phút, giúp bạn chế biến đa dạng món ăn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acPsqK30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0e5jdt26aqoltbq4s8qj.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acPsqK30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0e5jdt26aqoltbq4s8qj.jpg" alt="Ưu điểm và nhược điểm của nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#22-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;2.2. Nhược điểm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bên cạnh các ưu điểm kể trên, sản phẩm vẫn còn những nhược điểm như:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giá thành khá cao so với các loại nồi thường khác&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lớp chống dính sẽ khá mỏng nên khi lau chùi, vệ sinh cần cẩn thận để không làm xước&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sách hướng dẫn sử dụng hoàn toàn bằng tiếng anh nên đôi khi gây khó khăn cho người sử dụng&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trên đây là những ưu - nhược điểm của sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK. Dù còn một số nhược điểm nhỏ nhưng sản phẩm quả thực rất đáng trải nghiệm cho những ai đang tìm một chiếc nồi chiên không dầu chất lượng cao. Còn chần chờ gì nữa, sở hữu ngay chiếc nồi tuyệt vời này thôi!&lt;/p&gt;

ENJOY!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools &amp;amp; Cyber Attacks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    In the first of a series of 7 courses within the IBM "Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certification," you will learn about the current challenges that are occurring within the cybersecurity field. As more and more valuable information and resources that have monetary worth become available, the more security threats and alerts will increase. With this increase in security threats, one would think, &lt;span&gt;"with so many bad guys creating security threats and attacks, there must be a ton of good guys to counter the bad guys, right?".&lt;/span&gt; Well, unfortunately, that is not the case, there is a lack of skilled security professionals in the cybersecurity field. There was a global study conducted by the  Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) and Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) which states that &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/11/prweb14899778"&gt;"the cybersecurity skills shortage is exacerbating the number of data breaches,”&lt;/a&gt; with the top two contributing factors to security incidents being &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/11/prweb14899778"&gt;“a lack of adequate training of non-technical employees”&lt;/a&gt; (31%) first and &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/11/prweb14899778"&gt;“a lack of adequate cybersecurity staff (22%)”&lt;/a&gt; second. As attacks become more complex, the knowledge that is required to deal with these attacks begins to increase whilst the time we have to deal with the attacks unfortunately decreases. The longer it takes for professionals to respond to attacks, the more it will cost to recover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SOC Analyst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What is a SOC Analyst and what do they do?"&lt;/p&gt; A Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537510/soc-analyst-job-description-salary-and-certification"&gt;"is a cybersecurity professional who works as part of a team to monitor and fight threats to an organization's IT infrastructure".&lt;/a&gt; A SOC Analyst will also &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537510/soc-analyst-job-description-salary-and-certification"&gt;"assess security systems and measures for weaknesses and possible improvements."&lt;/a&gt; It is up to the SOC Analyst to use tools for reviewing Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) and decide which events should recieve a high level of priority over others. You can check out the article &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537510/soc-analyst-job-description-salary-and-certification"&gt;"SOC analyst job description, salary, and certification"&lt;/a&gt; by Josh Fruhlinger to learn more about what a SOC Analyst does and how you can get a career by becoming a SOC Analyst.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;What are We Talking about when We Talk about Cybersecurity?&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    In this section we will discuss the definition of cybersecurity, a few key terms and roles within security. Let's get started!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Information Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Now I know what you're thinking when it comes to defining the term "Information Security", and if you were thinking something along the lines of "securing information" then you are absolutely right! Information Security, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-12r1.pdf"&gt;"The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability."&lt;/a&gt; Within this definition are three importatant key words, "Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.". These three words together are known as the "CIA Triad", &lt;span&gt;"but what does confidentiality, integrity, and availability have to do with information security?"&lt;/span&gt; you might ask, well it actually has alot to do with information security, since the CIA triad is practically the building blocks to securing information. Let's get into more detail about what the CIA Traid really means!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CsJZV21WHtI/X4cY3_m2joI/AAAAAAAAAaw/atThz5mNkUoKjGShvxUKYz42eGGUuOSOwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B%2528171%2529.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UOicbyjV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CsJZV21WHtI/X4cY3_m2joI/AAAAAAAAAaw/atThz5mNkUoKjGShvxUKYz42eGGUuOSOwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%252B%252528171%252529.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  


&lt;h2&gt;The CIA Triad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    In the Information Security sub-section I mentioned the CIA Triad and what it is in minor detail, but lets discuss in further detail what the C.I.A in the triad really means.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
   Confidentiality &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The dictionary definition of "Confidentiality" is &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/confidentiality"&gt;"The ethical principle or legal right that a physician or other health professional will hold secret all information relating to a patient, unless the patient gives consent permitting disclosure."&lt;/a&gt; of course this is looking at it from a medical standpoint, but I'm sure you get the general idea 😊. Ok let's take Dictionary.com's definition and try to think of confidentiality from a technical standpoint, think about all the data a company has in their database, and we have security professionals taking measures to prevent said data from falling into the wrong hands. That is confidentiality.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
   Integrity&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    By definition Integrity is &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/integrity"&gt;"the state of being whole, entire, or undiminished"&lt;/a&gt;, so think of Integrity as the prevention of data being deleted or modified from an unauthorized source is essentially what Integrity stands for in the triad.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   Availability &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Available meaning to be &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/available"&gt;"suitable or ready for use; of use or service; at hand"&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to security, availability in essence means to have your data always ready to access when needed, by authorized users of course. A few best practices for maintaining availability would include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Continuity Plans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Redundancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Building A math community. MathJax</title>
      <author>Tristan Elliott</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/theplebdev/building-a-math-community-mathjax-dp0</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This series is going to be dedicated to building and launching my first web app, which is a website focused around individuals creating and sharing math content. Join me and let us try to to make our way through this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-did-i-found-out-about-mathjax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How did I found out about MathJax?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I simply created a post on twitter asking, &lt;code&gt;Does anyone know any good JavaScript libraries for visualizing math equations?&lt;/code&gt;. Eventually, a geophysicist replied with one word, &lt;code&gt;MathJax&lt;/code&gt; and that is how I found it. So if you ever have a question, tweet about it into the endless void that is twitter and maybe the void might answer back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-mathjax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is MathJax?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML and AsciiMat notation that works in all modern browsers. It was created with the goal to combine the power of modern web technologies with mathematics. MathJax requires no setup  on the part of the user(no plugins), so the page author can just write documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it properly. Basically, just add  MathJax to the project and it will handle displaying all the math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In MathJax mathematics is text based rather than image based, meaning that it can improve SEO because the equations are searchable just like normal text on websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MathJax includes the ability to generate speakable text versions of equations that can be used with screen readers. MathJax is highly configurable, allowing authors to customize it for the special requirements for any site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MathJax also has a rich API that can be used to make the mathematics on our webpages interactive and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now that we all know a little big more about MathJax I am working on creating a text editor in React that has the abilities of MathJax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this blog post of mine. If you have any questions or concerns please comment below or reach out to me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TristAndroidDev"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
