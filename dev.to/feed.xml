  How Does An NFT Marketplace Work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the simple steps that briefly explain how the NFT marketplace works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irrespective of the buyer or seller, the foremost step they have to take is to sign up with the platform by specifying the required information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial setup, a verification process has to be followed, which includes KYC. Once done with the verification, the crypto wallet will be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Henceforth, the users will be able to mint their works and their NFTs will be listed in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buyers who have interest in your NFT works would place their bids when works come for auction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the seller is self-satisfied with the bids, the auction will be closed and transactions made. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From now, the buyer will have ownership of the NFT works and these will be saved in their wallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#salient-features-to-consider-during-nft-marketplace-development"&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;yes you heard it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we frequently use &lt;strong&gt;console.log()&lt;/strong&gt; to check our outputs in console, it's ok in Development mode but it is highly disgraced in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so then what's the solution for it.so in production we basically use production grade loggers.This article is going to teach you how to use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.Why ps-logger ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt;yes you have &lt;strong&gt;few&lt;/strong&gt; other options but the problem is that you have to do lots of manual configurations in it.That's why beginners don't even touch production grade loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a plug and play logger.There is no manual configurations.you have to just install and use it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Gang, Feel lucky to see you again. when start to learning on flexbox, feel like the least well-explained property in Flexbox tutorials. start to getting confused😥 like what exactly &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behavior?? what's the difference between &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;?? etc.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, increase our frustartion rate right. After reading lots of blog and did some exprimentation. Finally grasped the answer for all question🎉🎉. Then I'm get ready to make you mastering on &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour and let's get this show on the road. So, Be feel like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6cOaC_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gxj5yoe0n9lrjytcffv0.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6cOaC_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gxj5yoe0n9lrjytcffv0.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before understanding of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;. Need to aware of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Main axis&lt;/b&gt; of flexbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex items formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Main axis of flexbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: row&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: row-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run left to right or right to left of the page in the inline direction (horizontally).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j86F582n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5h5wywuoo7cb5xntqasu.png" alt="Image description" width="522" height="152"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run top to bottom or bottom to top of the page in the block direction (vertically).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PyWG99nM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x9liam9aifn9hf5jt977.png" alt="Image description" width="709" height="227"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flex item formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex item(which means elements inside the flex container) following specific formula,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" alt="Image description" width="520" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which conveys that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the item's &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;br&gt;
If no &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the computed width of the item's contents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default value of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; take an element’s size across the main axis. which means,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you get my point😍. If can't, don't worry. You can understood through below example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 160px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;. If we change the flex direction to &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt;, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; thus alternately determines width or height, depending on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Seems like &lt;b&gt;dynamic&lt;/b&gt; in nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to practice in codpen like just swtich the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; and see the effect lively..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/preethi-dev/embed/bGoLOqe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Still with me🥳. I can understood, You are getting very curious about &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour. So, It's my pleasure to show you &lt;b&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; controls either “&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;” based on the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will override any other &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; properties if specifically declared anything other than &lt;code&gt;flex-basis: auto;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will still obey &lt;code&gt;min-width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; or height settings, which is based on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;, it first checks for a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; property (based on direction) if none, it uses the elements content sizing.(just remember that flex-item formula &lt;b&gt;content &amp;lt;- width &amp;lt;- flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is: the size of flex items before they are placed into a flex container(which means before the flex-shrink or flex-grow getting applied). &lt;b&gt;It's the ideal or hypothetical size of the items&lt;/b&gt;. After placing the flex item in flex container, things may getting changed based on flex container size. Because flex container won't have enough space(&lt;code&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/code&gt; start to shrinking the items), or will have extra space(&lt;code&gt;flex-grow&lt;/code&gt; start to growing the items).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uh😅, &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; guy have so much of behaviour and Congratulations,You reached the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please execuse me, I will end up with a bonus info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A best practice is to just use flex-basis instead of width or height&lt;/b&gt;. Especially since Safari still has an old flexbox bug where it won't apply flex-shrink properly to items that use height instead of flex-basis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i continue now, which make you feel overwhelmed😥. &lt;b&gt;So, If you feel need live example for key behaviours of flex-basis and just drop a comment &lt;/b&gt;which make a way to know about your thought and I will start to build part-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you loved this blog, Then give an endearing heart💝and drop your thought about this blog😍 which really a lot to me. I love the discussion with you, If you feel not comfortable at styling concepts or have any doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Reading!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preethi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Make your CSS life easier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm mixing up this week's win thread in honor of the upcoming new year (for those cultures that recognize the New Year as beginning this upcoming Saturday, that is). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking back on our weeks, what would you say your biggest win was for this past YEAR? What are you proud of having accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All wins count — big or "small" 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of 2021 'wins' include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a new job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to value your personal strengths &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking more time off to unplug with loved ones regularly ... or whatever else might have sparked joy and purpose ❤️ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your accomplishments in 2021! You're amazing 🌠 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to Asynchronous Processing and Message Queues</title>
      <author>Apoorv Tyagi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:08:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/introduction-to-asynchronous-processing-and-message-queues-27od</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/apoorvtyagi/introduction-to-asynchronous-processing-and-message-queues-27od</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a client-server architecture, the client can request a job to be done from the server by sending messages between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handling this communication can increase in complexity when you begin to manage the rate at which messages are sent, the number of requests a server can handle, or the response time which the client demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we'll see one way to handle this intricacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-synchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Synchronous Processing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In synchronous processing, a client sends a request to the server and waits for the server to complete its job and send back the response before the client can resume doing any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is often referred to as a &lt;em&gt;blocking&lt;/em&gt; request as the client gets blocked from doing any other work until a response is received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GNhszEDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532456293/NNIoKI1h2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GNhszEDd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532456293/NNIoKI1h2.png" alt="image.png" width="875" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-asynchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Asynchronous Processing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous processing is the exact opposite of synchronous processing. Here, the client doesn't wait for a response after sending a request to the server and continues doing any other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is referred to as a &lt;em&gt;non-blocking&lt;/em&gt; request as the execution thread of the client is not blocked. This allows systems to scale as more work can be done in a given amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#synchronous-vs-asynchronous-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synchronous requests block the execution thread of the client, forcing them to wait for the response to come before they can perform another action. On the other hand, asynchronous requests do not block and allow for more work to be done in a given time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we do not know much time the request will take, it is difficult to build responsive applications with synchronous processing. The more blocking operations, the slower system becomes. With asynchronous processing, response time is quick as the client does not have to wait on the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fault tolerance of asynchronous processing is higher than that of synchronous processing, as it is easy to build a retry mechanism when a request fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN6DiVmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532560708/lA0pdjuge.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wN6DiVmG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640532560708/lA0pdjuge.png" alt="image.png" width="450" height="253"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-message-queues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Message Queues?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message queue is a component that buffers requests from one service and broadcasts asynchronously to another service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, clients are the message producers, who send request messages to the queue instead of any server. They get an acknowledgment when the message is added to the queue, which enables them to continue with their other jobs without having to wait for the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Servers are known as message consumers and are served these messages from the queue based on the number of requests they can serve at any given time. This continues until all the messages in the queue have been served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most common messaging queues are — &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#structure-of-message-queues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Structure of Message Queues
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message queue is primarily a broker of messages between message producers and message consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each distinct entity in the messaging queue setup (producers, consumers, and queue) has a responsibility and they're decoupled from each other as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only contract between all entities is the messages for which the message queue facilitates the movement from producers to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following sections, we will discuss the responsibilities of each component and look at the various modes with which the message queue delivers a message to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-producers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Producers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message producers initiate the asynchronous processing request. Producers have a responsibility to generate a valid message and publish it to the message queue. Messages submitted to the queue are then queued up and delivered to consumers to be processed asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producers communicate with message queues using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-brokers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Brokers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message broker is simply just a queue. You can even implement a simple broker programmatically that buffers messages and sends them to consumers as and when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message brokers are the actual decoupling elements in the setup, sitting between and managing the process of communication between producers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of their simplicity, brokers are optimized for high concurrency and throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that adding message brokers introduces an extra layer of complexity into your infrastructure and requires you to scale them as well. Brokers also have specific requirements and limitations when it comes to scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#message-consumers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Message Consumers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main responsibility of consumers is to receive and process messages from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumers are API services that perform that actual asynchronous processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers can be implemented in different application languages or technologies and maintained independently from other components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve decoupling, consumers should know nothing about the producers. The only contract that should exist between the two is valid messages from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When properly decoupled, consumers can serve as independent service layers that can be used by both the message queue setup and other components in your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consumer-communication-strategies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Consumer Communication Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Message queues need to transmit messages down to consumers, depending on how application developers implement consumers, message queues have three distinct ways of delivering messages to the consumers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Pull Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, the consumer periodically checks the status of the queue. This is done at a scheduled interval programmed on the side of the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are messages found in the queue, the consumer picks them up until there are no more messages left to process, or when the 'N' number of messages has been consumed. This 'N' can be configured on the message broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Push Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a message is added, the consumer is notified and the message is then pushed down to it. Messages are pushed down to consumers at a rate at which the consumer can easily regulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Subscription Model&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this model, consumers can subscribe to a topic. This publisher publishes a message to a topic rather than a queue. Each consumer connected to the broker maintains its private queue to receive messages from topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the consumers subscribe to the topics and when a message is published to that topic, the message is cloned for each subscriber and added to the consumer’s private queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comparing-different-message-brokers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comparing Different Message Brokers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen above, for asynchronous communication we usually need a message broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the few considerations you have to look at when choosing a broker for managing your asynchronous operations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;: The number of messages sent per second in the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Data Persistency&lt;/strong&gt;: The capability to recover messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Consumer Capability&lt;/strong&gt;:  The capability to manage one-to-one / one-to-many consumers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rabbitmq"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  RabbitMQ
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Based on configuration and resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Both persistent and transient messages are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RabbitMQ supports all major languages, including Python, Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Swift, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kafka"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kafka
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Can send up to a million messages per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Only one-to-many&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kafka has managed SaaS on both Azure and AWS. Kafka also supports all major languages, including Python, Java, C/C++, Clojure, .NET, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Swift, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#redis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Redis
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Scale: Can send up to a million messages per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Persistency: Not supported (it’s an in-memory database).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  One-to-one vs One-to-many consumers: Both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redis is a bit different from the other message brokers. Redis is an in-memory data store. Originally, Redis only supported one-to-one communication with consumers. However, since Redis 5.0 introduced the pub-sub, you can have one-to-many as another option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we covered how asynchronous processing is advantageous over its counterparts and how a message queue helps us achieve asynchronous processing along with keeping the different entities in its setup decoupled from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also covered some basic characteristics of the most commonly used message brokers: Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit more detailed instruction for selecting the right message broker to use according to different use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-lived Messages: Redis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Redis is good for short-lived messages where persistence isn’t required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Amounts of Data: Kafka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Kafka is good for storing a large amount of data for long periods. Kafka is also ideal for one-to-many use cases where persistency is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Routing: RabbitMQ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  RabbitMQ is good for complex routing communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>HELM Cheatsheet: For Beginners</title>
      <author>aashiya123</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 06:01:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aashiya123/helm-cheatsheet-for-beginners-1cb3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aashiya123/helm-cheatsheet-for-beginners-1cb3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Helm is a package and operation manager for Kubernetes. Though handling Kubernetes applications and several releases can increase the development and deployment complexities. The Helm as a packaging manager allows you to wrap up all the Kubernetes components within a single package for deployment, thus reducing complexities. You can integrate several Kubernetes objects within the Helm chart, which is deployed as a whole. You can use Helm to deploy a single application or a part of an extensive application. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools that can be used with Helm charts to ease the Kubernetes deployment process. You can also integrate the Helm charts within the CI/CD process to automate each process, giving developers leverage to work on writing codes rather than running and handling production deployments. You can use and install the Helm with one click. Helm comes with the command-line user interface called ‘helm’ to perform the Helm functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are some Helm commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm help command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will provide you information about the available Helm commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want any details about the Helm command, you can use the helm help  below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm help search&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm search command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will allow you to search for the charts. You can use helm search  as mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm search phpmyadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;output-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
NAME                    CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION&lt;br&gt;
stable/phpmyadmin       4.3.5           5.0.1           DEPRECATED phpMyAdmin is an mysql administration frontend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm fetch command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above command, you can download the chart locally without installing it. You can use the chart name with the fetch command to download all the charts and template files within the directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm fetch stable/phpmyadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;# ls -ltr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
Total 32&lt;br&gt;
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 28921 Jun 29 11:04 phpmyadmin-4.3.5.tgz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm install command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the above command, you can easily install the chart followed by the chart name. You can use the ‘- name’ option if you want to name the deploy chart and ‘- version’ to specify the chart version as per your requirement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm install stable/phpmyadmin --name myphpadmin --version 4.3.3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above command will provide the deployed resources overview, which can be checked from the Kubernetes with the below command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# kubectl get all |grep -i myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm init command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the above command to initialize the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm status command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the chart installation status using the above command. You have to provide the chart name about which you want the status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm status myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm list command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the list command with complete details of the currently deployed chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm list&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
NAME            REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     NAMESPACE&lt;br&gt;
myphpadmin      1               Mon Jun 29 11:35:32 2020        DEPLOYED        phpmyadmin-4.3.3        5.0.1           default&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm upgrade command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the upgrade command, you can upgrade the chart version. In the above examples, we have version 4.3.3, and now we are upgrading it to 4.3.4 using the below command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm upgrade myphpadmin stable/phpmyadmin --version 4.3.4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm history command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above command’s help, you can check the installed chart’s history followed by the chart name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm history myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION&lt;br&gt;
1               Mon Jun 29 11:35:32 2020        SUPERSEDED      phpmyadmin-4.3.3        5.0.1           Install complete&lt;br&gt;
2               Mon Jun 29 11:53:48 2020        DEPLOYED        phpmyadmin-4.3.4        5.0.1           Upgrade complete&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm rollback command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the rollback command if you want to move to the previous version of the helm chart. You have to mention the version number with the command as mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm rollback myphpadmin 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rollback was a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm delete command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can delete the helm chart using the delete command as mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm delete myphpadmin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
release "myphpadmin" deleted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm repo list command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the above command, you can list down the repositories used currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm repo list&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
NAME    URL&lt;br&gt;
stable  &lt;a href="https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com"&gt;https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
local   &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm repo update command
With the help of the above command, you can update the repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm repo update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...&lt;br&gt;
...Skip local chart repository&lt;br&gt;
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository&lt;br&gt;
Update Complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm reset command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the reset command to uninstall the tiller component and the ‘-remove-helm-home’ option after the remove command to remove the helm’s home directory. You can use the ‘-f’ option to remove it forcefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm reset -f --remove-helm-home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;output- &lt;br&gt;
Deleting /root/.helm&lt;br&gt;
Tiller (the Helm server-side component) has been uninstalled from your Kubernetes Cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chart installation and manipulation command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating chart template
The above command will allow you to create the chart template with the .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;# helm create &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;overriding helm values&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm install --name  --values config.yaml --timeout 300 --wait stable/mysql&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting environment variable on creating release&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm install --set x=somevalue -f config.yaml  --name &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check the syntax of the helm chart &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm lint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm lint &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To upgrade the chart or variables in a release&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm upgrade --values config.yaml  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To inspect the chart details along with the chart name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm inspect &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To inspect the values assigned in the chart along with the chart name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm inspect values &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create package as a .tgz file [if you have chartmuseum] &lt;br&gt;
_helm package  _&lt;br&gt;
_helm package . _&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To install chart dependencies &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;helm dep up  _&lt;br&gt;
_helm dependency update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How I Sync Daily LeetCoding Challenge to Todoist</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jerrynsh/how-i-sync-daily-leetcoding-challenge-to-todoist-4d9a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever been on a job hunt for a software developer position, you would have come across the so-called LeetCode style interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that most of us don’t have to &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/"&gt;invert a Binary Tree&lt;/a&gt; at our actual job, that is how most coding/technical interviews are conducted at big tech companies like Google and Microsoft. Yes, even at the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies"&gt;unicorns&lt;/a&gt; (except for Stripe, because they are cool) and startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll be writing about the thought process of how I came about building and deploying a very simple JavaScript app for free with &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"&gt;Cloudflare Worker&lt;/a&gt;. If you simply want to deploy and use the app on your own, check out the repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/ngshiheng/todoleet"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  How to get the Daily LeetCoding Challenge question using LeetCode API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Creating a Todoist task using Todoist API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Schedule our app to run daily using Cloudflare Worker ScheduledEvent API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  How to test a Cloudflare Worker Cron trigger locally with Miniflare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#problem-statement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Problem Statement
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since a year ago, I have been trying to make it a habit to solve the Daily LeetCoding Challenge (which I’m still struggling with). As I am using &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/"&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; as my main productivity tool of choice, I have a daily task that looks just like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjNmaAcB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ybr1vh7bwp9ihw2ivbdr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjNmaAcB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ybr1vh7bwp9ihw2ivbdr.png" alt="My Todoist habitual tasks" width="700" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Todoist habitual tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a lazy person, having to check leetcode.com every time I want to practice is too much of a hassle. So then I thought, why not just sync the Daily LeetCoding Challenge to my Todoist every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by defining what I want the app to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Daily LeetCoding Challenge question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to create a new task on my Todoist account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync new Daily LeetCoding Challenge question on time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app has to sync on time for free every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leetcode-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  LeetCode API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any sane person would do, the first thing I did was to do some research. By research, I meant I started to Google for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to immediately Google for “leetcode API”, looking for the official API documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#official-api-documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Official API documentation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, there wasn’t any official LeetCode API documentation available. While there is a couple of unofficial LeetCode API repositories on GitHub, I would rather not use any unofficial API due to reliability concerns (poorly maintained, outdated, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-good-ol-devtool-inspection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Good Ol’ DevTool inspection
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing that immediately came to my mind was to inspect the network request being made while visiting the site &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/"&gt;https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, I was able to figure out the exact API called to query for the Daily LeetCoding Challenge — done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vw5UmkHo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kebw2s3s6y0kjugedpj6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vw5UmkHo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kebw2s3s6y0kjugedpj6.png" alt="Since LeetCode is using GraphQL, you would need to check out the “Payload” tab to see the GraphQL body" width="700" height="382"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since LeetCode is using GraphQL, you would need to check out the “Payload” tab to see the GraphQL body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the GraphQL request body:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight graphql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# HTTP POST to https://leetcode.com/graphql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;questionOfToday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activeDailyCodingChallengeQuestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;userStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;acRate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;difficulty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;freqBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frontendQuestionId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;questionFrontendId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isFavor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paidOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isPaidOnly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titleSlug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasVideoSolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hasSolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;topicTags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command below to try it out yourself:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--url&lt;/span&gt; https://leetcode.com/graphql &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{"query":"query questionOfToday {\n\tactiveDailyCodingChallengeQuestion {\n\t\tdate\n\t\tuserStatus\n\t\tlink\n\t\tquestion {\n\t\t\tacRate\n\t\t\tdifficulty\n\t\t\tfreqBar\n\t\t\tfrontendQuestionId: questionFrontendId\n\t\t\tisFavor\n\t\t\tpaidOnly: isPaidOnly\n\t\t\tstatus\n\t\t\ttitle\n\t\t\ttitleSlug\n\t\t\thasVideoSolution\n\t\t\thasSolution\n\t\t\ttopicTags {\n\t\t\t\tname\n\t\t\t\tid\n\t\t\t\tslug\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n","operationName":"questionOfToday"}'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code&lt;br&gt;
Enough talking, let’s start to write some code that does exactly what we went through:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Just some constants&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LEETCODE_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://leetcode.com/graphql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DAILY_CODING_CHALLENGE_QUERY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`
query questionOfToday {
    activeDailyCodingChallengeQuestion {
        date
        userStatus
        link
        question {
            acRate
            difficulty
            freqBar
            frontendQuestionId: questionFrontendId
            isFavor
            paidOnly: isPaidOnly
            status
            title
            titleSlug
            hasVideoSolution
            hasSolution
            topicTags {
                name
                id
                slug
            }
        }
    }
}`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// We can pass the JSON response as an object to our createTodoistTask later.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchDailyCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Fetching daily coding challenge from LeetCode API.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DAILY_CODING_CHALLENGE_QUERY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LEETCODE_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Task “Get Daily LeetCoding Challenge question” — checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#todoist-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Todoist API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like what we did in the previous step, I was able to find the &lt;a href="https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/#overview"&gt;official API documentation&lt;/a&gt; for Todoist. Typically, the first section that I always look for in API documentation is the &lt;a href="https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/#authorization"&gt;Authorization&lt;/a&gt; section, especially when you want to perform create/update/delete operations on an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, authorization was pretty straightforward for Todoist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations"&gt;Get your API token&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you make a request, attach &lt;code&gt;Authorization: Bearer xxx-your-todoist-api-token-xxx&lt;/code&gt; to your HTTP request header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what the curl command to create a new task on Todoist would look like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'https://api.todoist.com/rest/v1/tasks?='&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Authorization: Bearer xxx-your-todoist-api-token-xxx'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{
"content": "Buy a jar of peanut butter",
"due_string": "Today"
}'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a function that does what we said is relatively easy, it looks something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionLink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`https://leetcode.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Creating Todoist task with title &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;questionTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="na"&gt;due_string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;priority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;Authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Bearer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODOIST_API_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Set at environment variable&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;TODOIST_API_ENDPOINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/tasks`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Task “Create a new task on my Todoist account” — done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cloudflare-worker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cloudflare Worker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’re down to our one final task — running/automating the 2 tasks above every day, for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that came to my mind was Cron job. So, I immediately started looking for free solutions on the Internet. After spending a couple of hours doing some homework, I came across Cloudflare Worker, and I figured to give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It runs on V8 JavaScript, not Node.js&lt;br&gt;
This is probably one of the most common misconceptions &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-workers/"&gt;about Cloudflare Worker&lt;/a&gt;. As the worker’s environment is not in Node.js, a lot of packages (e.g. &lt;code&gt;npm install some-node-package&lt;/code&gt;) that are running on Node.js would simply not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: Check out the supported packages and libraries &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/works"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, we only need to use the JavaScript built-in &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a Cloudflare Worker project is dead simple (&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;), basically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the Wrangler CLI using &lt;code&gt;npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run wrangler generate  &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts#templates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entry point is &lt;code&gt;addEventListener&lt;/code&gt; function. For our use case, we will be using the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/scheduled-event"&gt;ScheduledEvent&lt;/a&gt; API where we simply have to change our event from &lt;code&gt;"fetch"&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;"scheduled"&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s stitch everything together:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Move the constants to const.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;syncLeetCodeCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchDailyCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createTodoistTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;question&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;scheduled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Change 'fetch' to 'scheduled'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;waitUntil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;syncLeetCodeCodingChallenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we would simply need to modify the wrangler.toml as below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight toml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="py"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;your-project-name&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"webpack"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nn"&gt;[triggers]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="py"&gt;crons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"1 0 * * *"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the setting above, the worker will run every day at &lt;a href="https://crontab.guru/#1_0_*_*_*"&gt;00:01 UTC&lt;/a&gt; and sync the Daily LeetCoding Challenge to your Todoist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all! Moving on to testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-test-cloudflare-workers-locally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to test Cloudflare workers locally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to try out the Cron triggers locally, we would need to install the &lt;a href="https://miniflare.dev/cli.html"&gt;Miniflare CLI&lt;/a&gt;. After installation, you may run your worker using:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# At terminal 1&lt;/span&gt;
miniflare

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# At terminal 2&lt;/span&gt;
curl &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"http://localhost:8787/.mf/scheduled"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you see a new task is created on your Todoist, you have made it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deployment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No side project is ever done without hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy the app on your own immediately, check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ngshiheng/todoleet"&gt;project repository&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href="https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ngshiheng/todoleet"&gt;“Deploy with Workers”&lt;/a&gt; button. If you’re interested in the know-how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Cloudflare account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;TODOIST_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;wrangler secret put TODOIST_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt;. You may find the newly added secret under 'Cloudflare Worker' → 'Settings' → 'Variables'. You can get your Todoist API token &lt;a href="https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: This is only required for &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-cloudflare-workers-with-wrangler"&gt;Wrangler actions&lt;/a&gt;. Add &lt;code&gt;CF_API_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; into your GitHub repository secrets. You can create your API token from &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens"&gt;https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;Edit Cloudflare Workers&lt;/code&gt; template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, to publish any new changes to your Cloudflare Worker, run &lt;code&gt;wrangler publish&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we are finally done!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s a lot more that we could have done, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Handling unanswered questions from previous days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Making the app configurable/customizable for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Add tags to our task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Allowing users to create a random LeetCode question as a task based on question tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to leave these features out for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a lot of hate on coding interviews as such, I personally look at it this way — by learning some brain teasers, you probably get paid a lot more, so why not? It is really a matter of perspective. If you happen to enjoy doing them, that is even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t find as much joy doing LeetCode questions. Rather, I work on LeetCode problems as if I am lifting weights at the gym. While I don’t enjoy lifting weights, I do like reaping the benefits of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for today. Let me know what are you building with Cloudflare Worker!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Simplest backend</title>
      <author>S.K.Roshan</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 05:39:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/roshansk/the-simplest-backend-e40</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/roshansk/the-simplest-backend-e40</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Connecting to a database and managing it absolutely not beginner friendly! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing your backend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and Deploying on the other side requires further knowledge about cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a backend developer myself who usually writes the backend in python coupled with a micro framework called &lt;a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt; it's quite hard and time consuming to deploy a single letter change I made in script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now its not gonna be the same, integrating a backend is simplified to integrating an API!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSV2API is tiny project that helps noobs to integrate a Database with the beginner knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's how we do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A database as the name suggests we need data, it is usually store in cloud storages. Here it is going to a CSV file that is manually stored in our repository or any other online storage provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimum pre-requisite in a Database is &lt;strong&gt;querying&lt;/strong&gt; and CSV2API supports that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will be using this &lt;a href="https://github.com/dev-Roshan-lab/healthcare/blob/main/data.csv"&gt;sample&lt;/a&gt; dataset, which talks about a list of Doctors and their job in their niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a simple API request to our simplest backend which is already created for us, in python programming language would be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1"&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-host'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-key'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"YOUR-RAPIDAPI-KEY"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"GET"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a simple API request can helps us with a JSON string which can further consumed as per the needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let us understand the code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first we import &lt;a href="'https://pypi.org/project/requests/'"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; which is used to send API requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We define required variables to send a &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; request. replace &lt;strong&gt;YOUR-RAPIDAPI-KEY&lt;/strong&gt; with the key that you get on signing up for the free &lt;a href="'https://rapidapi.com/dev.vividgoat/api/csv2api1/'"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we send a &lt;strong&gt;GET&lt;/strong&gt; request to the API.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One that we need to keep in mind is that &lt;strong&gt;url&lt;/strong&gt; parameter in the request URL requires a raw CSV file url unlike the common link to any CSV file in Github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here's how we get it:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jsh32MLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/baa78cr5xj2d6jppweng.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jsh32MLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/baa78cr5xj2d6jppweng.png" alt="Raw image github" width="880" height="89"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally we print what requested for!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Querying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Querying is very important in accessing and receiving data, without it might cause numerous troubles when the application is scaled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;receiving huge amounts data can make the app slower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might lead to unwanted expenses in cloud provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parsing the JSON will get harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing changes into the data will consume more CPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes it harder for the developer to work on the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily we have a support for querying in CSV2API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here's how we do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we pass a URL parameter called &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt;, for example in our sample dataset we have columns called &lt;strong&gt;name, type, rating, goodReviews, totalScore, satisfaction, isfavourite, image, description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can query in such a way that we only get the data of a doctor with specific &lt;strong&gt;rating&lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dev-Roshan-lab/healthcare/main/data.csv"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"query"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name=='Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva' and rating==4.5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-host'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"csv2api1.p.rapidapi.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'x-rapidapi-key'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"YOUR-RAPIDAPI-KEY"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"GET"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;querystring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above snippet the query we passed to our database is &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;query= name == 'Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva' and rating == 4.5&lt;/code&gt; where we are asking the API to return us the data where there name of the Doctor is Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva and his rating is 4.5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{"results":[{" meet_id":" null"," tags":"Throat problem*Ear problem*Ear Nose Throat Diseases*Microscopic Ear Surgery*Endoscopic Nose &amp;amp; Paranasal Sinus Surgery ( Fess)*Microscopic Laryngoscopic Surgery*Sleep Disorders*Hearing Aids*Sinus Surgery*Ear Infection","description":"Dr. Sanjay Sachdeva is one of the best ENT Surgeons in Delhi with specialization in Otorhinolaryngology.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see the amount just drastically reduced and comprehending is now way easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String must be passed under single quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boolean must be Capitalized. eg: &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; is correct &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; is wrong similarly for True.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integers or Float should be under single quotes or double quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test the API for further columns and for different data at &lt;a href="https://rapidapi.com/dev.vividgoat/api/csv2api1/"&gt;RapidAPI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got doubts or facing errors?&lt;br&gt;
Lemme see what you got, in the Discussions&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'your name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"subject"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'subject'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"email"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'youremail'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"message"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"message"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;placeholder=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'message'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"submit"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'form-button'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Send Mail"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useRef() hook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note - The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Result -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Log] &amp;lt;form class="contact-form"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" class="form-input" name="name" placeholder="your name"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="text" class="form-input" name="subject" placeholder="subject"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="email" class="form-input" name="email" placeholder="youremail"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="message" class="form-input" name="message" placeholder="message"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="submit" class="form-button" value="Send Mail"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;7 . Now call emailjs.sendForm()&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;emailjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_SERVICE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;YOUR_USER_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function generate email message and send it to your mail id.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Public Solving: Creating a song with JavaScript</title>
      <author>Chris Bongers</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/public-solving-creating-a-song-with-javascript-10cb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today's puzzle is really cool, I enjoyed every step of it, and the outcome is super fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elves have provided us with a piece of paper with letters on them. They say it should be some kind of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's up to us to find and create sound waves for each letter and see what song they send to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/devadvent/puzzle-21"&gt;You can find the complete puzzle here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can't wait, try out the outcome of today's puzzle on this CodePen. (Hint: turn up your volume)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/rebelchris/embed/jOGLRMe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#thinking-about-the-solution"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thinking about the solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenge has multiple parts to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part, we have to build a metronome function. This function will execute a function every x time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to use an interval to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would work best as we have a separate function that should stop whatever happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part consists of finding the right frequency for a note, for which we will use a simple lookup table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, we should play the melody based on a string.&lt;br&gt;
I'll split the string into pieces and call our metronome function to play and remove the letter it played from the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will play the whole song and then stop the metronome function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let's get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#building-a-javascript-music-player"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Building a JavaScript music player
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, we'll have to work on the metronome function first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the &lt;code&gt;stopMetronome&lt;/code&gt; function. This function should simply erase the current interval that's looping.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopMetronome&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;metronomeInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the start function, we should start by clearing any existing intervals.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;metronomeInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we need to convert the &lt;code&gt;bpm&lt;/code&gt; property into a millisecond interval.&lt;br&gt;
For this, we can use the following formula.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bpm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we can start our interval.&lt;br&gt;
Each loop should execute the function that's being passed to it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;metronomeInterval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it, we created a metronome function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then have to make a lookup table to find the frequencies for each letter. &lt;br&gt;
I've decided to make a simple lookup table.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteToFrequency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;261.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;293.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;329.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;349.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;392.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;440.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;493.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And as for the function that should get the frequency for a letter, it's as easy as this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getFrequency&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;noteToFrequency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we can start on the &lt;code&gt;stopMelody&lt;/code&gt; function. This should simply call the &lt;code&gt;stopMetronome&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopMelody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopMetronome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now on to the exciting part, playing the melody.&lt;br&gt;
The first thing we need to do is split the string into an array for each character.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we can call our metronome function and pass the bpm and a new function we'll call &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startMetronome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bpm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This play function is where we will actually play the audio and modifications of the &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We evaluate if the array is empty because then we have to stop playing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;stopMelody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we need to retrieve the first letter in the array, which we'll be playing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could be a letter or an empty space.&lt;br&gt;
Only if it's a letter should we play it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;playNote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getFrequency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, we can simply remove the first element from this array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;notes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! &lt;br&gt;
We build our own custom music player in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's test it to see if we succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8H2eStg1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640155446088/gx65nk78GW.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8H2eStg1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640155446088/gx65nk78GW.png" alt="Running the test cases" width="712" height="314"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed doing this assignment and would love to hear what you would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
