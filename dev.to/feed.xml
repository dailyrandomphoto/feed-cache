&lt;p&gt;Today I have gained some knowledge about JS DOM (Document Object Model). Also, read some documentation about machine language and high-level programming language. also completed some real-time practice on DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the next day, I will share my daily practice via the GitHub link. Thank you all so much for supporting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you had the right color scheme, a consistent theme and a UX backed by some thrilling research on where to place a UI element, or even used SSR-like principles for other fronts of user experience but &lt;strong&gt;will your web app be able to befriend a screen reader?&lt;/strong&gt; Being accessible is somehow left out of the comprehension of many designers and developers in the webspace. Although naturally, the concepts this blog sets to address are meant for web-based projects, application development should round the circle even better. A few of these will strike you the tallest if you have, maybe, some experience in app development.&lt;br&gt;
Find out and answer, &lt;strong&gt;"If being inaccessible was a crime, would you be arrested?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessible websites are crucial to the health of the internet. The more accessible a site is, the more people can reach it, use it, and enjoy it. The more people can reach, use, and enjoy a site, the more likely it is to be successful. The more successful the site is, the more likely it is to become a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-is-that-all-accessibility-means"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But is that all accessibility means?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, if you are not aware of how to design your website in such a way that it becomes accessible for all, you might end up providing an inadequate experience to some users. Today’s world is &lt;strong&gt;“experience first”&lt;/strong&gt;. Many designers, developers, and web admins just are able to capture the essence of the experience for the general public. To add to it, there are many web design and development tools which abstract these for you. But the question is whether this is “captured” to an extent that the application running on the web is equally accessible to all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you had the right color scheme, a consistent theme and a UX backed by some thrilling research on where to place a UI element, or even used SSR-like principles for other fronts of user experience but will your web app be able to befriend a screen reader for a user who has visual challenges?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental questions you can ask yourself to begin evaluation of accessibility in your application could be, "Will the app provide a smooth experience using a screen reader?", "Can someone navigate the application using keyboard only?". There are many other amazing ways people use the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example - Some HTML elements have semantic meaning but no dedicated functionality. These include aside, footer, header, etc. This semantics serves the screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that elements can be described using the ARIA spec or a simple tabindex can help a user tab to an element? Another interesting concept is focus management which provides a necessary clue about the currently active item to the user. To learn more about such examples, and the foundation of web accessibility, this resource by Jon Kuperman might be a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The matter, in many cases, is that being accessible is somehow left out of the comprehension of many designers and developers in the webspace. Although naturally, the concepts this blog sets to address are meant for web-based projects, application development should round the circle even better. A few of them will strike you the tallest if you have, maybe, some experience in app development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you dream of that fancy loader for your website? Yes, it has got animations, colors that flicker in and out. Or do you have the next idea for an animated 404 page?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDN says, "Content that flickers, flashes, or blinks can trigger photosensitive epilepsy. Web technologies that use video, animated gifs, animated png, animated SVGs, Canvas, and CSS or JavaScript animations are all capable of content that can induce seizures or other incapacitating physical reactions".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-accessibility-anyway"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Accessibility anyway?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is the responsibility of everyone involved in the development process. It is the responsibility of the designer, the developer, and the webmaster to make sure that the product is accessible. It is a moral and ethical issue as well as a legal one. Addressing accessibility in your processes and making it inclusive from the beginning serves more than one purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is for everyone. Why shouldn't it be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and many others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is a combination of design, development, and strategy. A well-designed site can be easily made accessible, and an inaccessible site can be made accessible. It is a matter of the right processes and the right attitude. Accessibility is a commitment to a set of standards and guidelines that will ensure your content is visible to users with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make your site accessible, you need to ensure that all the information you present can be accessed and used by anyone, regardless of any disability. You may need to include alternative text for images, provide text alternatives for audio and video content, and ensure that your site works with assistive technologies such as screen readers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility (Accessible Design) is a set of principles and practices that help make web content accessible to everyone including people with disabilities. It is also known as inclusive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-standards"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which Standards?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) aims to lead the Web to its full potential by developing standards and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web. Accessibility is one of the core values of the W3C. The W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is the largest international industry consortium focused on improving the accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WAI guides developers of websites and software, information architects, site designers, and others to make the Web accessible to people with disabilities. The WAI also provides education, outreach, testing tools, and resources to help developers make their products and services accessible to a wide range of people with disabilities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several levels of conformance to accessibility guidelines. The most basic level is called "Level A". Level A conformance requires that your site can be used with a keyboard only. Achieving this level of conformance requires that all of the functionality of your site can be accessed with the keyboard and the page is readable. For example, if the user is required to click a link to access a page, the link must be keyboard accessible. The user must be able to navigate to the link and activate it using the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next level is called "Level AA". Level AA conformance is a significant extension of Level A. Level AA conformance requires that all of the functionality of the site and any of the content can be used with the keyboard. This includes any images or buttons on the page. In addition, the page must be readable when using a screen reader. The page must also provide a way to navigate to any links on the page. This ensures that the page can be easily navigated using a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third level is called "Level AAA". Level AAA conformance is the most stringent level of conformance. Level AAA requires that all of the functionality of the site can be used with the keyboard. This includes any images or buttons on the page. In addition, the page must be readable when using a screen reader. The page must also provide a way to navigate to any links on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-how-do-i-evaluate-my-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But how do I evaluate my app?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of free tools available over the internet which run some automated tests on your web app and return an accessibility score. While this can be step zero to get started on evaluation but adherence and compliance to different levels of standardized accessibility levels ensure that your app does well on accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 1: 100 days of code</title>
      <author>Gaurav-Shekhawat</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 16:07:57 +0000</pubDate>

  &lt;a href="#1-how-to-center-an-div-element-vertically-or-horizontally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. How to center an div element vertically or horizontally.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to center an div element, few of them are:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method1-using-marginauto-for-horizontal-centering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method-1: Using margin:auto (For horizontal centering)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this method, if the width of our element is less than 100%, we can just set its margin value to auto, and this will automatically center the element horizontally.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/yLbrLBQ?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method2-using-cssflexbox-both-horizontal-and-vertical-centering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method-2: Using css-flexbox (both horizontal and vertical centering)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/YzVMzYQ?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method3-using-cssgrids-both-horizontal-and-vertical-centering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method-3: Using css-grids (both horizontal and vertical centering)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The below example is for horizontal centering, similarly we can center the element vertically.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/gOWyOee?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The other method for both horizontal and vertical centering at the same time is using:-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;place-items: center;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
which is a shorthand for &lt;code&gt;align-items&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;justify-items&lt;/code&gt; in order.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.center-inside-of-me {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method4-using-transform-translate-property-both-horizontal-and-vertical-centering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method-4: Using transform: translate property( both horizontal and vertical centering)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the below codepen by Gabriel Laroche for the example. Although using this method is not recommended and must be used only when the other methods are not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/ExmJarE?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method5-using-inset-and-marginauto"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method-5: using inset and margin:auto
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is almost similar to the previous method. The inset property is defined in the notes section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/rNmbOeE?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method6-abusing-margin-and-padding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method-6: abusing margin and padding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we can remove the height from our parent element, so that it will become the same height as the child. Now, we horizontally center the child it using &lt;code&gt;margin: 0 auto&lt;/code&gt; , then we increase the top and the bottom padding, so that the element seems centered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/XWRQmeW?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#difference-between-position-relative-and-position-absolute"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Difference between position relative and position absolute
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary:-   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative property defines the behaviour with respect to the element's current position. The element is not removed from the normal flow of the document.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In absolute positioning, the element is removed from the normal flow of the webpage, and is positioned with reference to its first ancestor having position: absolute/relative (very imp)(like if you want to center an div2 inside a div1, then first you have to set the display property of div1 to be relative, then the display property of div2 to be absolute, and then this will work), otherwise with respect to the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See this &lt;a href="https://leannezhang.medium.com/difference-between-css-position-absolute-versus-relative-35f064384c6"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; of medium to understand the concept in full detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see this standford &lt;a href="http://stanford.edu/group/csp/cs03/week5/text6.html"&gt;slide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/"&gt;css-tricks&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#css-raw-position-sticky-endraw-property"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Css &lt;code&gt;position: sticky&lt;/code&gt; property
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This property is mostly used to make a sticky navigation bar at the top of your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best guide:- &lt;a href="https://elad.medium.com/css-position-sticky-how-it-really-works-54cd01dc2d46"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See this &lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/position-sticky-2/"&gt;css-tricks&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#sticky_positioning"&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; complete guide to position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary:- Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threshold must be defined in the form of top/bottom/right/left.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#all-background-properties"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  All background properties
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background image
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-image/"&gt;css-tricks article on background image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Short Summary:-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  background: url(sweettexture.jpg);
  background: linear-gradient(black, white);
  background: radial-gradient(circle, black, white);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Setting a Fallback-color:- If the background image is not supported, then the fallback color will be loaded instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  background: url(sweettexture.jpg) blue;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple Background Images:- The image that you want on the top should be listed first. These may be used to put logo on top of a background, after changing some of the properties, as given in the second code block.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  background: url(logo.png), url(background-pattern.png);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;body {
  background:
    url(logo.png) bottom center no-repeat,
    url(background-pattern.png) repeat;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The codepens of each of these are:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/poPBgRj?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background-gradients"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background Gradients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-gradients/"&gt;css-trick's&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please make sure that you go through the above guide, it is wonderfully made. I left the tricks section for later. Also cannot understand anything below the pie chart example. &lt;br&gt;
Points that I noticed:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default value of the angle in the &lt;code&gt;linear-gradient (angle, color1, color2)&lt;/code&gt; is not 0deg, but it is 180deg. Play with the below codepen to understand more.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/eYWoJrW?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background-position"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background position
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first value is the horizontal position, while the next value is the vertical position. The lengths and pertencages are measured from the top left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The percentages have special meaning:- moving a background image by X% means it will align the X% point in the image to the X% point in the container. For example, 50% means it will align the middle of the image with the middle of the container. 100% means it will align the last pixel of the image with the last pixel of the container, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When four/three(this just means that the remaining one value is 0) are given, then they are interpreted as:-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.three-values {
  background-position: right 45px bottom;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This positions the background image 45px from the right and 0px from the bottom of the container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.four-values {
  background-position: right 45px bottom 20px;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This puts the background image 45px from the right and 20px from the bottom of the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/BaREzZr?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multiline-underline-textgradient-animation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multiline underline text-gradient animation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1vEGYWaaQY"&gt;KevinPowell&lt;/a&gt; video link.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/mdmgeKp?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background-size"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background size
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-size/"&gt;css-tricks&lt;/a&gt; article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various ways are:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords:- cover full covering the entire container, even if it has to cut some parts of the image, or expand the image. contain respects the aspect ratio of the image, and shows the whole image, even if it has to leave some empty space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Value:- Example: 400px, this will be considered as width, and the height will be set to auto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two values:- First is the width, second is the height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple Images:- We can specify their sizes individually. Example: -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;html { background:url(greatimage.jpg),url(wonderfulimage.jpg);
  background-size: 300px 100px, cover;
  /* first image is 300x100, second image covers the whole area */
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will follow the background stacking order.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#background-repeat"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Background repeat
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-repeat/"&gt;css-tricks&lt;/a&gt; article  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#few-notes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Few Notes:-
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the padding property, the values are written in the clockwise order starting from top.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. top padding is 25px
2. right padding is 50px
3. bottom padding is 75px
4. left padding is 100px
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If position: sticky; - the top property behaves like its position is relative when the element is inside the viewport, and like its position is fixed when it is outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSS element+element Selector:- Example:-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Select and style the first &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; element that are placed immediately after &lt;/p&gt; elements. This was used in the above medium article for sticky position so the space between two rows can be 20px, while the most upper and the most bottom space be 10px.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The property top/bottom/right/left are measured with reference to its nearest positioned ancestor(just parent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding some shadow to a div element makes it look much much better. You will also learn some bad way to center an element inside its container. Also, we can put variables inside a CSS file!!!!.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/grvskwt/embed/VwbNLOe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;inset&lt;/code&gt; CSS property is a shorthand that corresponds to the top, right, bottom, and/or left properties. It has the same multi-value syntax of the &lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt; shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#points-that-i-still-need-to-work-upon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Points that I still need to work upon
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background gradient (things left from the article).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background repeat (round and space(some))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the second part of the series on Top Facebook Behavioral Interview Questions. In the first part, we discussed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;Introduction to Facebook Behavioral Interview (Jedi Round)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=155s"&gt;Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=457s"&gt;Tell me about a time you showed leadership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=712s"&gt;Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=873s"&gt;Tell me about the project that you are most proud of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=1032s"&gt;Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=1320s"&gt;Tell me about yourself?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=1478s"&gt;Why do you want to leave your current role?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObFGBUF-TuQ&amp;amp;t=1632s"&gt;Do you have any questions for me?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r4nj2EAA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gfzypq1lfshckzv4m7sf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r4nj2EAA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gfzypq1lfshckzv4m7sf.png" alt="Top Facebook Behavioral Interview Questions (Part 1) | Facebook Jedi Interview Round" title="Top Facebook Behavioral Interview Questions (Part 1) | Facebook Jedi Interview Round"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us review the next top behavioral questions, which are usually asked at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#question-1-tell-me-about-a-time-you-had-to-handle-pressure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Question 1: Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j7614MME--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rzsfuu4aupr90rm67i4j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j7614MME--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rzsfuu4aupr90rm67i4j.png" alt="Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure" title="Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5UJnKxwyg&amp;amp;t=53s"&gt;Video Explanation&lt;/a&gt; with Evaluation Criteria, Response Framework, Tips &amp;amp; Tricks, Sample Answer (Example), and a Special Case of "Never Worked Under Pressure".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handling work pressure and stressful situations is a crucial part of everyone's career journey. Interviewers often ask candidates to tell about a time they had to handle pressure at their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TkzFVgbO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ysjci4cyntgfv1p6z3r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TkzFVgbO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ysjci4cyntgfv1p6z3r.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ke0R6l2N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rk3t26r3449d1cumhyao.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ke0R6l2N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rk3t26r3449d1cumhyao.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Had To Handle Pressure'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone faces stressful situations and comes under pressure once in a while at their jobs. Through this question, the interviewer's goal is to assess whether you can perform in challenging situations or unstructured environments and distinguish between the urgent and the important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to understand if you can stay calm, exercise judgment, and act responsibly in such unexpected high-pressure scenarios. They are also evaluating your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers want to know if you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle competing priorities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift gears when needed, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the implications of missing deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are looking to see if your coworkers can rely on you to get the work done.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#question-2-tell-me-about-a-time-you-worked-with-a-difficult-person"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Question 2: Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JkPSqpbF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64c4uyzn2nl8o7ysetj6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JkPSqpbF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64c4uyzn2nl8o7ysetj6.png" alt="Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5UJnKxwyg&amp;amp;t=452s"&gt;Video Explanation&lt;/a&gt; with Evaluation Criteria, Response Framework, Tips &amp;amp; Tricks, Sample Answer (Example), and a Special Case of "Never worked with a difficult person".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person" is one of the most frequent questions asked in behavioral interviews. Interviewers sometimes phrase this question as "Tell me about a time you worked with someone challenging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rktvsb4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zzt6w0jikazap38ea4g8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rktvsb4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zzt6w0jikazap38ea4g8.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzrIIWRI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ubiny7f8s4c1qmejre3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzrIIWRI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ubiny7f8s4c1qmejre3.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, in every workplace, you will face a situation where you have to work with a colleague who has a difficult personality. By asking this question, the interviewer's goal is to assess how you work in difficult situations or unstructured environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to judge your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maturity level,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication skills, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to speak up irrespective of your coworkers' seniority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also evaluating whether you are empathetic and respectful towards your colleagues while understanding your coworker's motivations and viewpoints behind the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial element to this question is that the interviewer is looking for a positive resolution of the conflict that benefits the company and not just an individual. They are trying to see if you are flexible to compromise and open to learning from challenging experiences.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#question-3-tell-me-about-a-time-when-the-project-was-ambiguous"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Question 3: Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uKTQTY81--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wcrphex5gj8rjl7g9lcn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uKTQTY81--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wcrphex5gj8rjl7g9lcn.png" alt="Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous" title="Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5UJnKxwyg&amp;amp;t=874s"&gt;Video Explanation&lt;/a&gt; with Evaluation Criteria, Response Framework, Tips &amp;amp; Tricks, Sample Answer (Example), and a Special Case of "Never Worked On Ambiguous Projects".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tell me about a time when the project was ambiguous" is one of the tough questions asked in the behavioral interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--srzZ4LbR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2m25amm2tnkktu7dg6h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--srzZ4LbR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2m25amm2tnkktu7dg6h.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5kwzQ0S4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g60o0njhhtk2w9tv0gwg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5kwzQ0S4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g60o0njhhtk2w9tv0gwg.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time When The Project Was Ambiguous'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In everyone's career journey, they face a challenging situation where they need to work on a task that is ambiguous, uncertain, and does not have a clear path forward. By this question, the interviewer's goal is not to trick you but to assess how well you can adapt and perform in challenging situations and unstructured environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to understand your ability to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proactive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay calm,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise judgment, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act responsibly in such unexpected scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are assessing your perseverance to explore the ambiguity and learn new things, despite the challenges. They are also evaluating your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers want to know if you can handle competing priorities, shift gears when needed, and understand the implications of missing deadlines. They are looking to see if your coworkers can rely on you to get the work done.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#question-4-tell-me-about-a-time-you-worked-on-something-outside-your-okr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Question 4: Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VvZu188t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dpb9xwfg7o56n7uwcing.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VvZu188t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dpb9xwfg7o56n7uwcing.png" alt="Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR" title="Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5UJnKxwyg&amp;amp;t=1301s"&gt;Video Explanation&lt;/a&gt; with Evaluation Criteria, Response Framework, Tips &amp;amp; Tricks, Sample Answer (Example), and a Special Case of "Don't Have Any Work Experience".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tell me about a time when you worked on something outside your OKR" is a popular open-ended question asked in behavioral interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results, which is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewers also tend to ask this famous question in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about a time when you exceeded your coworkers' or manager's expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe a time you went beyond the expectations of a customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever exceeded expectations in one of your previous jobs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever worked on a side-project at your workplace?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CuUjuGf8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ixnhxmqap3n1qlkd8s0i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CuUjuGf8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ixnhxmqap3n1qlkd8s0i.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DKamdITV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5vhsbvut1gi16fp4ita.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DKamdITV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5vhsbvut1gi16fp4ita.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked On Something Outside Your OKR'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grow in Software Engineering careers, employers expect developers to exceed expectations for promotions to the next level. By this question, the interviewer is trying to assess your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work ethic,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personality, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation to take on new challenges with a positive attitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to understand your ability to be proactive and your perseverance to learn new things continuously. Employers want to know if you are independent in your thought process and have the willingness to do more than what is expected from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also evaluating your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another popular behavioral interview question is "Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WsNCaqAU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nsqgktozebh99m85m5tl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WsNCaqAU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nsqgktozebh99m85m5tl.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Had To Learn Something Quickly" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Had To Learn Something Quickly'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YkoMqJUG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ajablz5je6f1le0xmuj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YkoMqJUG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ajablz5je6f1le0xmuj.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Had To Learn Something Quickly" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Had To Learn Something Quickly'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In everyone's career journey, they face a situation when they have to learn something quickly to succeed at their job. By this question, the interviewer's goal is not to trick you but to assess how well you can adapt and perform in challenging situations and unstructured environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to understand your enthusiasm to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn new things,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise judgment under pressure, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift gears when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also evaluating your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication skills,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to self-identify the gaps in your skills, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The willingness to improve yourself continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are looking to see if you understand the implications of missing deadlines and can your coworkers rely on you to get the work done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#question-6-tell-me-about-a-time-you-received-constructive-feedback"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Question 6: Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6-6gzcQS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ty1seij05oa3ne3vopdy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6-6gzcQS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ty1seij05oa3ne3vopdy.png" alt="Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback" title="Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tell me about a time you received constructive feedback" is one of the most challenging questions asked in the behavioral interview. Interviewers sometimes also ask this question as "What is your greatest weakness?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--clShXJlO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2qtm1wa9ds9vl1csmim.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--clShXJlO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2qtm1wa9ds9vl1csmim.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wHRCtd3A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u00yrf1c38ad3xipo74s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wHRCtd3A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u00yrf1c38ad3xipo74s.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Received Constructive Feedback'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone makes mistakes in their careers and has received constructive feedback from their managers or peers. By this question, the interviewer's goal is not to trick you but to assess how you react when you receive feedback from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to get a handle on how well you can adapt and perform in challenging situations and unstructured environments. They are trying to judge your ability to stay calm and composed with the right attitude when receiving criticism of any type, whether constructive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers want to understand your enthusiasm to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn new things,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise judgment under pressure, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift gears when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also evaluating your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication skills,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to identify the gaps in your skills, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The willingness to improve yourself continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  Question 7: Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r1TWndgQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rgj1spw5141jtyckg99c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r1TWndgQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rgj1spw5141jtyckg99c.png" alt="Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected" title="Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software Engineering projects usually take longer time than planned. As a result, interviewers often ask the candidates to tell about a time when their project took longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hWQp_OFp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7yaxe0lgc6r407obre8o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hWQp_OFp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7yaxe0lgc6r407obre8o.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BL6A-0R8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/teozp6kvqbql5llpya8n.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BL6A-0R8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/teozp6kvqbql5llpya8n.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time A Project Took Longer Than Expected'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in their career journey has worked on a project which has taken more time than initially planned. By asking this question, the interviewer's goal is to assess whether you can adapt and perform in challenging situations or unstructured environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want to get a handle on how well you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage competing priorities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the implications of missing deadlines, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift gears when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to see if you can distinguish between the urgent and the important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers want to know your ability to stay calm, exercise judgment, and act responsibly in such unexpected high-pressure situations. They are assessing your perseverance to explore the ambiguity and learn new things, despite the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewers are also evaluating your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision-making skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are looking to see if your coworkers can rely on you to get the work done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Serverless API with Cloud Function and Fauna</title>
      <author>Arjuna Sky Kok</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/arjunaskykok/building-a-serverless-api-with-cloud-function-and-fauna-66e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, you're going to learn about how to build a serverless rest API using Cloud Functions from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud Functions is a scalable function as a service that doesn't need you to provision a server. It's available in some programming languages, like Python, Node.js, Java, and so on. Fauna is a scalable transactional database available as an API, either as GraphQL or FQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pre-requisites
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow this article, you need an account in Fauna and a GCP account. You can &lt;a href="https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register"&gt;create a new account in Fauna&lt;/a&gt; for free. If you give payment information to GCP, you can get &lt;a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started"&gt;a free $300 credit&lt;/a&gt; for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-database-in-fauna"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a database in Fauna
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://dashboard.fauna.com/"&gt;Fauna's dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, click the &lt;strong&gt;CREATE DATABASE&lt;/strong&gt; button to create a new database for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Oe059Kfh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ep4wd3cpcschu401u3l4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Oe059Kfh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ep4wd3cpcschu401u3l4.png" alt="The Fauna's dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll be presented with a form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1QUDTI9z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1tqq396jllgsjxu9fnaj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1QUDTI9z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1tqq396jllgsjxu9fnaj.png" alt="Create Database form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill &lt;em&gt;cloud-functions-api&lt;/em&gt; as the name, choose &lt;em&gt;Classic&lt;/em&gt; as the region group, and make sure the &lt;em&gt;Use demo data&lt;/em&gt; field is unselected. Finally, click the &lt;strong&gt;CREATE&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the creation process, you'll see the option to create your first collection in this database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---3-Yocmn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/issq6tydnmu42n4z6859.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---3-Yocmn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/issq6tydnmu42n4z6859.png" alt="New Collection button"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;NEW COLLECTION&lt;/strong&gt; button to create your first collection. A collection is like a table in a traditional database. You'll see a form to create a new collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C_RyJhex--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x0irxz962ya893zmznnd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C_RyJhex--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x0irxz962ya893zmznnd.png" alt="New Collection form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill &lt;em&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Collection Name&lt;/strong&gt; field, &lt;em&gt;9&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;TTL&lt;/strong&gt; field. History days is how long you want to keep these documents. TTL means how many days you will keep these documents after the last write. Finally, click the &lt;strong&gt;SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; button. You’ll see a collection page where you have an option to create a document for that collection. A document is similar to a row in a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NRKWdoPB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d4m5ekdprstgpk6sya46.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NRKWdoPB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d4m5ekdprstgpk6sya46.png" alt="New Document button"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;NEW DOCUMENT&lt;/strong&gt; button. You’ll be redirected to the page where you can create a new document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5KsWfurb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bgitpdgxzq9aixytp3eq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5KsWfurb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bgitpdgxzq9aixytp3eq.png" alt="New Document form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a new document with JavaScript syntax—just create an object or a dictionary. In this example, you create an object that describes the name, the symbol, and the price of a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Finally, click the &lt;strong&gt;SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll be redirected to the collection page. Create a new document again with another cryptocurrency. Use Ethereum this time. Here is the JavaScript object:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;name:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Ethereum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;symbol:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ETH"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;price:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After doing that, the page of the collection should have two documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r1k_QsCp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4cuwdi6drogirxw6mgd8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r1k_QsCp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4cuwdi6drogirxw6mgd8.png" alt="cryptocurrencies Document"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, your database name is &lt;em&gt;cloud-functions-api&lt;/em&gt;, your collection name is &lt;em&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/em&gt;, and you have two documents, as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to access this database in your API, you need to create an API key. Click the &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; menu item on the left menu. You’ll be on the &lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OCMpCqA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uo1i2jk127rqwcd86rm1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OCMpCqA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uo1i2jk127rqwcd86rm1.png" alt="Security form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;NEW KEY&lt;/strong&gt; button. Here, you are presented with the form to create a new key. The default values should do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8MUSMT9G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7erimp52xmvd4bn8755.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8MUSMT9G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g7erimp52xmvd4bn8755.png" alt="New key form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; button. You'll be presented with your key's secret. Copy it to somewhere safe. Your API needs this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--szehBvta--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9zk9olcpu2m947bf8r07.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--szehBvta--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9zk9olcpu2m947bf8r07.png" alt="Key's Secret page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#storing-the-apis-secret-to-secret-manager"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Storing the API’s Secret to Secret Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of embedding the key's secret in your source code, you'll store the secret in GCP's Secret Manager. It's good practice not to store the secret in code. Go to the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager"&gt;GCP's Secret Manager landing page&lt;/a&gt;. Then click the &lt;strong&gt;Go to console&lt;/strong&gt; button. Here, you are presented with the Secret Manager page, where you can see the list of your secrets. If this is your first time, then you'll see none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wu0xTpy_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6d8j3x9hrgpo7ilxmju0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wu0xTpy_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6d8j3x9hrgpo7ilxmju0.png" alt="Secret Manager page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;CREATE SECRET&lt;/strong&gt; button. You'll see the form to store your secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4wLCQvuz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5yd71zozulti09gw2xn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4wLCQvuz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d5yd71zozulti09gw2xn.png" alt="Create secret form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill &lt;em&gt;faunasecret&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt; field. Fill your Fauna API's secret in the &lt;strong&gt;Secret&lt;/strong&gt; value field. Finally, click the &lt;strong&gt;CREATE SECRET&lt;/strong&gt; button. You'll be redirected to the secret list page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UHttc2L3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wrflwqk1rti1lge0qo1w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UHttc2L3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wrflwqk1rti1lge0qo1w.png" alt="Secret details page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, you get your secret by referring to the secret's path, which is the one that is circled with a red color circle, as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-a-service-account-key-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating a Service Account Key File
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access the secret via API, you need a way to authorize your application. The way is to use a service account key file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the Getting started with authentication page and follow the guide on the page. Create a service account with the &lt;strong&gt;Owner&lt;/strong&gt; role. Then for the service account you've created, create a new key. You'll get a JSON file. The name of the downloaded file is &lt;em&gt;service-key.json&lt;/em&gt;. You're going to need it when you want to get the secret in your cloud function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-cloud-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setting Up Cloud Functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to set up your API in Cloud Functions. Go to the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/"&gt;Cloud Functions landing page&lt;/a&gt;. Then click the &lt;strong&gt;Go to console&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll land on the console page. Click the burger menu so you can click the &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Functions&lt;/strong&gt; menu item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lCbnBgTZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1kf249xd7cpseyr7cf8u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lCbnBgTZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1kf249xd7cpseyr7cf8u.png" alt="GCP's left panel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Cloud Functions page, you can see all the cloud functions you have built. If you just started, you'll see none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WywKJQah--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rshvd7asv9l2jn79izma.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WywKJQah--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rshvd7asv9l2jn79izma.png" alt="Cloud Functions page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;CREATE FUNCTION&lt;/strong&gt; button. You'll view the form to create a cloud function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--89n1ivwJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cstha40wijry0w75ow3j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--89n1ivwJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cstha40wijry0w75ow3j.png" alt="Cloud Functions form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill &lt;em&gt;function-crypto-list&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;function name&lt;/strong&gt; field. Copy the URL of this cloud function. You'll need it when you want to call the function. Select &lt;strong&gt;Allow unauthenticated invocations&lt;/strong&gt; option. Then click the &lt;strong&gt;SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking the &lt;strong&gt;SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; button will collapse the &lt;strong&gt;Trigger&lt;/strong&gt; section. Scroll to the bottom of the page to create an environment variable. In the &lt;strong&gt;Runtime&lt;/strong&gt; environment variables section, click the &lt;strong&gt;ADD VARIABLE&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m9X1wASD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7q6ktukqvi0pu7hn7f1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m9X1wASD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7q6ktukqvi0pu7hn7f1.png" alt="Runtime environment variables"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill &lt;em&gt;GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt; field, then fill the &lt;em&gt;service-key.json&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Value&lt;/strong&gt; field. Finally, click the &lt;strong&gt;NEXT&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see the form to edit the code. By default, you’ll get the Node.js runtime, and change it to Python 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dcgt1egJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5fbxp6z1mhcxvo0ommf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dcgt1egJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p5fbxp6z1mhcxvo0ommf.png" alt="Edit code form"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this form, you can see there are many parts other than the &lt;em&gt;Runtime&lt;/em&gt;. You have the &lt;em&gt;Entry point&lt;/em&gt; section. This is the entry function in the code that will be executed when you call your public URL. If your function needs third-party libraries, you’ll add third-party libraries in the &lt;strong&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/strong&gt; file. If you need a new file, you'll click the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/strong&gt; file to add two third-party libraries. Add these lines to the file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;google-cloud-secret-manager
faunadb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/strong&gt; should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EOvrc3Qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rtp6ivwntxuc90dudnyk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EOvrc3Qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rtp6ivwntxuc90dudnyk.png" alt="requirements.txt"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Fauna&lt;/strong&gt; library is needed to access your collection in the Fauna database. You need the &lt;strong&gt;google-cloud-secret-manager&lt;/strong&gt; to retrieve your Fauna's API key that you stored in Google Secret Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; button. You'll be presented with the small form to give a new name to the new file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bM_mWxfo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sqm5ipglzfdqmkk6hny9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bM_mWxfo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sqm5ipglzfdqmkk6hny9.png" alt="Creating a new file"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name the new file &lt;em&gt;service-key.json&lt;/em&gt;. You'll see empty content. Fill it with the content of the &lt;em&gt;service-key.json&lt;/em&gt; file you downloaded previously. This is the way to authenticate your application to access your secret in GCP Secret Manager. Remember that you have set &lt;strong&gt;GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS&lt;/strong&gt; environment variable with &lt;em&gt;service-key.json&lt;/em&gt; as the value. The content should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dumbWHiz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l8nyrqutn7u6jt4xkdzf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dumbWHiz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l8nyrqutn7u6jt4xkdzf.png" alt="service-key.json file"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to the &lt;strong&gt;main.py&lt;/strong&gt; file. Fill &lt;em&gt;index&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;Entry point&lt;/strong&gt; field. Then replace the content of the file with the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb.objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb.client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FaunaClient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;google.cloud&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secretmanager&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;YOUR_PROJECT_ID&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"faunasecret"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_manager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secretmanager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecretManagerServiceClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;access_secret_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"projects/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/secrets/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/versions/1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FaunaClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cryptocurrencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;map_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paginate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;cryptos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cryptos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to replace &amp;lt;YOUR_PROJECT_ID&amp;gt; with your GCP's project ID. Your screen should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iANO-Za0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgllpun7c5qgrpniueiv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iANO-Za0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dgllpun7c5qgrpniueiv.png" alt="main.py file"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You access your secret with the &lt;strong&gt;secret_version&lt;/strong&gt; method of an instance of secret manager service client. You give the path of your secret to the method. The number 1 in the path refers to the first version of the secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the secret which is your Fauna’s key secret, you create a Fauna client. Then you construct a query to get all documents from the &lt;em&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/em&gt; collection. You execute this query with the &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; method of your Fauna client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then click the &lt;strong&gt;DEPLOY&lt;/strong&gt; button. It takes a while before your public API goes live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it goes live, you can test it with curl.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-Type: application/json"&lt;/span&gt; YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’ll get this output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bitcoin"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"price"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;38000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"symbol"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"BTC"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Ethereum"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"price"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"symbol"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"ETH"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You've created a cloud function to view the list of the cryptocurrencies collection. Let's create another function to create a document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For creating a document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the same steps as before. You can give &lt;em&gt;function-crypto-create&lt;/em&gt; as the name to the function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you allow the unauthenticated invocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an environment variable just like before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to change the entry point for the cloud function's code, add necessary third-party libraries, and create a &lt;em&gt;service-key.json&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then replace the content of the source code with the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb.objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb.client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FaunaClient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;google.cloud&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secretmanager&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;PROJECT ID&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"faunasecret"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_manager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secretmanager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecretManagerServiceClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;access_secret_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"projects/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/secrets/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/versions/1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FaunaClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;crypto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cryptocurrencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;crypto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"ref"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Success"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Failed"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this creating document method, you create a query to create a document with the &lt;strong&gt;create&lt;/strong&gt; method of the &lt;strong&gt;q&lt;/strong&gt; object. The method needs a collection and data for the document. Then you execute this query with the &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; method of your Fauna client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deploying your cloud function, you can test it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-Type: application/json"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{"name": "Uniswap", "symbol": "UNI", "price": 21}'&lt;/span&gt; YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You'll get this output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Success
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can confirm your newly created document in Fauna's dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've created a cloud function to create a cryptocurrency document. Let's create another function to update the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For updating the document, do the same steps as before. You can give the &lt;em&gt;function-crypto-update&lt;/em&gt; name to the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the necessary steps, replace the content of the source code with the code below:&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crypto_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"ref"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;got&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;got&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"ref"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Success"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Failed"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the method to update the document, you need a reference. So you retrieve the list of all documents first from the collection, then you get the reference of the document you want to update. With the reference in hand, you create a query to update the document with the &lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt; method of the &lt;strong&gt;q&lt;/strong&gt; object. The method needs a reference and the new data. Finally, you execute the query with the &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; method of your Fauna client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deploying your cloud function, you can test it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-Type: application/json"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'{"data": {"name": "Bitcoin", "symbol": "BTC", "price": 40000}, "id": 0}'&lt;/span&gt; YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You'll get this output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Success
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can confirm your document has been updated by checking it in Fauna's dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've created a cloud function to update the &lt;em&gt;cryptocurrency&lt;/em&gt; document. Let's create another function to delete the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For deleting the document, do the same steps as before. You can give the &lt;em&gt;function-crypto-delete&lt;/em&gt; name to the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the necessary steps, replace the content of the code of the function with the code below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jsonify&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb.objects&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ref&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;faunadb.client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FaunaClient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;google.cloud&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secretmanager&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;YOUR_PROJECT_ID&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"faunasecret"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_manager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secretmanager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SecretManagerServiceClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;access_secret_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"projects/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;project_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/secrets/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/versions/1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FaunaClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cryptocurrencies"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

  Next Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial demonstrates how quickly you can build a serverless application with the Fauna database as your data storage. However, the application is still barebone. You need to add authentication, monitoring, validation, and so on. For authentication, you can use a Google-generated ID token in the Authorization header of your request. Head to the &lt;strong&gt;Authenticating for Invocation&lt;/strong&gt; page to see the complete guide on invocation authentication. GCP Cloud Functions also provide monitoring solutions. You can go to the &lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Cloud Functions&lt;/strong&gt; page to read the documentation about monitoring cloud functions.&lt;/p&gt;

  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, you've learned how to create a database, a collection, and some documents on Fauna. Then you stored Fauna's API key as a secret to GCP Secret Manager. Finally, you built an API on GCP Cloud Functions. In this API, you retrieved the Fauna's API key from GCP Secret Manager, then created a query to the Fauna database to list the documents on the collection, create a new document, update the document, and delete the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start building with Fauna and GCP today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main advertisement channel is of course &lt;strong&gt;people who are in love with your product&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Their sharing activities is the best advertisement. Thus, the main idea is to &lt;br&gt;

  &lt;a href="#use-advanced-google-search-techniques"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Use Advanced Google Search Techniques
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google supports &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/"&gt;powerful search techniques&lt;/a&gt; that may help you to promote your resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-sites-linking-to-competitors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find sites linking to competitors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find sites linking to your competitors and try to add your link to that web-sites as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s &lt;code&gt;link:&lt;/code&gt; operator was officially deprecated in 2017.  But it does still return some results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might be a good idea to exclude competitor web-site itself from the search results by using the &lt;code&gt;site:&lt;/code&gt; operator to avoid displaying of internal links&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the following Google search but with you competitor's URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;link:https://competitor-domain.com/blog -site:competitor-domain.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-guest-post-opportunities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find guest post opportunities
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to find web-sites where you might submit the article about your new project/product/startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick your niche keyword (i.e. &lt;code&gt;programming&lt;/code&gt;) and Google search for guest post related phrases like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;programming intitle:"write for us" inurl:"write-for-us"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use other phrases like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;contribute to&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;become a contributor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;guest post guidelines&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;inurl:guest-post&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also search for many of these at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;programming ("write for us" | inurl:"guest-post-guidelines" | inurl:"guest-post")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(programming | machine learning) AND ("write for us" | inurl:"guest-post-guidelines")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-resource-page-opportunities"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find resource page opportunities
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource pages contains the links to best resources on specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a good idea to pitch your resource for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find resource pages you might do the following Google search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;programming (intitle:"resources" | inurl:resources)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you might narrow it down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;intitle:programming AND intitle:resources AND inurl:resources&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-more-related-resource"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find more related resource
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you found a good web-site to place a link to you might want to find similar relevant resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so just do the following Google search but with the resource you're interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;related:https://news.ycombinator.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#register-in-startup-directories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Register in Startup Directories
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Link&lt;/th&gt;

      <title>Intro To Spring's Aspects</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/jarjanazy/intro-to-spring-s-aspects-4pee</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-spring-aspect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Is A Spring Aspect? 😲
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, it's a reusable part of code (Advice) that is injected into a certain part (joinPoint) of the application (defined by Pointcuts) at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Use it? 🤨
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Address common concerns across our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#like-what"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Like what?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logging 📝&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction management 🗄&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caching 🔗&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security 🔐&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#its-used-all-over-the-place-in-spring-framework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  It's used all over the place in Spring framework
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is one of the two core concepts that the Spring framework is built on, the second one being &lt;strong&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-get-to-know-the-agents-behind-spring-aspects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's Get To Know the agents behind Spring Aspects 🥷🏽
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#join-point"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Join point 🔧
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joinpoint is a candidate point in the Program Execution of the application where an aspect can be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This point could be a method being called, an exception being thrown, or even a field being modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the points where your aspect’s code can be inserted into the normal flow of your application to add new behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advice"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advice 📖
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  The code that addresses system wide concerns (logging, security checks, etc...) representing the action to perform at a joinpoint specified by a pointcut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pointcut"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pointcut 📌
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A pointcut is an expression that defines at what joinpoints, the associated Advice should be applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aspect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Aspect 🔍
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Aspect is the class that defines the aspect’s behavior and a pointcut defining where the aspect should be executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ready-for-some-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ready For Some Coding? 🤩
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-write-a-simple-usecase-of-logging-something-to-the-console-on-the-call-of-a-certain-method"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's write a simple use-case of logging something to the console on the call of a certain method.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start by adding the maven dependency for AOP&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight xml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;spring-boot-starter-aop&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, let's create a class and annotate it with &lt;code&gt;@Aspect&lt;/code&gt; to mark that this class will contain &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advice methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pointcuts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
We also need to annotate it with &lt;code&gt;@Component&lt;/code&gt; so it becomes managed by Spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class will handle the simple task of logging to the console.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Aspect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;LoggingAspect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Pointcut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"@annotation(Loggable)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;logAllMethodCallsPointcut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Before&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"logAllMethodCallsPointcut()"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;logAllMethodCallsAdvice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"From Aspect"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to create the loggable annotation&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ElementType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;METHOD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Retention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;RetentionPolicy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;RUNTIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Loggable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-did-we-just-write"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What did we just write? 👀
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;@Pointcut("@annotation(Loggable)")&lt;/code&gt; declares the &lt;code&gt;logAllMethodCallsPointcut&lt;/code&gt; method as a pointcut for all method annotated with &lt;code&gt;Loggable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Before("logAllMethodCallsPointcut()")&lt;/code&gt;  declares &lt;code&gt;logAllMethodCallsAdvice&lt;/code&gt; advice which will be called before any method annotated with &lt;code&gt;Loggable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-lets-create-a-service-that-will-act-as-our-join-point"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now let's create a service that will act as our join point 🧠
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Service&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HomeService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Loggable&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this here is what's called a join point  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;homePage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"From Service"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now when we call the &lt;code&gt;homePage&lt;/code&gt; method, the &lt;code&gt;logAllMethodCallsAdvice&lt;/code&gt; advice method will be called before it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#so-we-will-see-the-following-logs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  So we will see the following logs 👇
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Aspect &lt;br&gt;
 From Service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remind-me-why-are-we-doing-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remind Me Why Are We doing This? 😢
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example seems useless for the simple case we have, &lt;strong&gt;however&lt;/strong&gt; imagine having a system with &lt;strong&gt;hundreds&lt;/strong&gt; of methods that you want to log something about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you call the same code before each and everyone? 🤔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if you want to change the implementation of the logging process?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to search for all the usages and change them 😖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, you can create a service and call it from all those places, but imagine having more things other than logging.

      <title>🔪 killing tmux</title>
      <author>Waylon Walker</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:44:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/killing-tmux-4800</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/killing-tmux-4800</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to switch gears, we are onto a different part of our day and there are just too many sessions running and we need to clean up shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#killserver"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  kill-server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One viable option is to nuke the whole dang thing.  I actually do this more than you might think.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux kill-server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;save and commit your work diligently before &lt;code&gt;kill-server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#killsession"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  kill-session
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more reasonable option might be to kill a single session.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# kills the current session&lt;/span&gt;
tmux kill-session

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# kills the session named scratch&lt;/span&gt;
tmux kill-session &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; scratch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choosetree"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  choose-tree
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killing sessions one by one from the command line can be a bit tedious, and involve more keystrokes than necessary.  Another option built right into tmux is &lt;code&gt;choose-tree&lt;/code&gt;.  By default &lt;code&gt;choose-tree&lt;/code&gt; is bound to &lt;code&gt;prefix+s&lt;/code&gt;, that's pressing control+b then s.  Once you are in &lt;code&gt;choose-tree&lt;/code&gt;, you can navigate around with your configured navigation scheme, press &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to kill a session, or pane or window then &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to confirm.  You can also batch delete by tagging items with t, and killing them all at once with &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://waylonwalker.com/tmux-choose-tree/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BWMAnEq1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.waylonwalker.com/tmux-choose-tree-og_250x140.png" alt="article cover for &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
 tmux choose-tree&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
          &lt;br&gt;
              &lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 tmux choose-tree&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
          &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;check out this post for a bit more information on choose-tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fuzzy-matcher"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  fuzzy matcher
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my preferred way, using a fuzzy matcher.  I recently improved this one by making it a popup and cleaning it up based on a repsonse,&lt;a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2022/08/06/tmux-output-formatting/"&gt;tmux-output-formatting&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro"&gt;DJ Adams&lt;/a&gt;.  I press prefix+k to bring up a kill-session menu.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;bind &lt;/span&gt;k display-popup &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-E&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    tmux list-sessions -F '#{?session_attached,,#{session_name}}' |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    fzf --reverse -m --header=kill-session |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;
    xargs -I {} tmux kill-session -t {}"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note this is setup to multiple sessions all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Expectations on Junior Developers are not what you think</title>
      <author>Simon Barker</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:18:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/allthecode/expectations-on-junior-developers-are-not-what-you-think-22fb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/allthecode/expectations-on-junior-developers-are-not-what-you-think-22fb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your first day as a junior developer is gong to be scary, not because &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; a junior dev is scary but because the first day of any job is scary. Meeting new people, seeing a new code base, expectations that you can and will write code and deliver is on time, all of these combine to be quite stressful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a secret to tell you, the expectations on junior developers is pretty low and that's because the job of being a developer is different from simply "knowing how to code". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating with none technical people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated how long something will take&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the existing code base and data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with git in a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging live applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these are core skills of being a developer that can really only be learned "on the job", with this being your first job no one expects you to know all these things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do they expect from you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That you can code simple solutions to simple problems&lt;/strong&gt;. Don't get fancy, your code will likely not be the best structured and so 3 levels of ternary on one line isn't going to impress anyone if they can't understand it. Use simpler constructs with good variable and function names and focus on expressing your codes intention as clearly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That you will listen&lt;/strong&gt;. You might come in with a few projects under your belt but in the grand scheme of things you just haven't been coding long enough to not be able to learn something from everyone on the team. Right now, the best thing you can do is learn about the code base, learn about the business needs and absorb as much as you can on all aspects of developer life. This also applies to feedback, don't be defensive about your code, accept code review comments and make changes as suggested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That you are keen no matter the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Companies that have existing code will have a lot of different technologies across their IT estate. If you know React and server-less but get asked to work on some crusty old PHP and JQuery app then just dive in. Take it as an opportunity to learn something and increase your future employability. If you want a long fruitful career in tech then you will be changing language and technology often, at this stage working on older stuff is just as valuable as new stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That you help&lt;/strong&gt;. Don't just stick to your work and ignore what's going on around you. If a deployment has gone wrong, find out if you can help - it might just be monitoring a stream of logs but it's helping the team. If the database has gone down and customers are sending support requests faster than they can be closed, then see if you can help answer them. If someone is stuck, even if they are a senior, ask if they can explain it to you, often giving them someone to talk it though with leads to a solution due to the new perspective they gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these 4 tips will put you head and shoulders above many new developers and show you are in the career to develop both technically and as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugging a Rails App in Vim With Vimspector</title>
      <author>Igor Irianto</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:08:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/iggredible/debugging-a-rails-app-in-vim-with-vimspector-pi</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/iggredible/debugging-a-rails-app-in-vim-with-vimspector-pi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/learnvim"&gt;@learnvim&lt;/a&gt; for more Vim tips and tricks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently published an article on Vimspector (&lt;a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/debugging-in-vim-with-vimspector-4n0m"&gt;Debugging in Vim with Vimspector&lt;/a&gt;). There I covered different ways to run Vimspector for various Javascript environments. If you're a Rails developer like me, you may ask, "I'm sold on Vimspector, but how can I run it in Rails?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be frank, there are not a lot of resources online on how to accomplish this. After tinkering for a few days, I found a few setups that work on a basic Rails application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not claiming that this is the foolproof way to debug any Rails application. There are rooms for improvement and exploration. But for starting out, this is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article assumes that you have had some experience with Vimspector. At minimum, you need to know how to step into, step over, and step out of breakpoints. You also need to know how to launch and restart Vimspector. If you don't, please read my previous article first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-basic-rails-app"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create a Basic Rails App
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of practical learning. I believe you'll get far more mileage if you actually do the steps as you are reading this article. So for the sake of hands-on approach, let's create a brand new Rails app. Don't worry, it should take less than 5 min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new Rails app:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails new hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a controller:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails generate controller Says hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's go to the controller and write up some codes. Inside &lt;code&gt;./app/controllers/says_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt;, modify the &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; action:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SaysController &amp;lt; ApplicationController
  def hello
    @time = DateTime.now
    @greetings = "Greetings"
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;hello.html.erb&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Says#hello&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%= @greetings %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is now &amp;lt;%= @time %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excellent! Let's quickly test if the Rails app is running properly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/says/hello"&gt;http://localhost:3000/says/hello&lt;/a&gt;. You should also see the values of the &lt;code&gt;@greetings&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@time&lt;/code&gt; instance variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-important-gems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding Important Gems
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vimspector isn't a debugger. It's a "middle-man" that talks to a debugger. Vimspector provides a standard protocol to communicate with different debuggers. With Vimspector, you can communicate the same way with a Node debugger, Python debugger, Go debugger, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Vimspector to work with Ruby, you need to install a Ruby debugger. We will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby-debug/ruby-debug-ide"&gt;ruby-debug-ide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, you also need to install &lt;code&gt;debase&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/main/docs/debugger.md"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). Add these two in your gemfile (in a real project, you probably want to put them inside the &lt;code&gt;group :development, :test do ...&lt;/code&gt; block)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem 'ruby-debug-ide'
gem 'debase'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vimspector-json"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vimspector JSON
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.vimspector.json&lt;/code&gt; at the Rails project root. Inside it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "configurations": {
    "rails": {
      "adapter": "cust_vscode-ruby",
      "default": true,
      "configuration": {
          "name": "Debug Rails server",
          "type": "Ruby",
          "request": "launch",
          "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
          "pathToBundler": "/Users/iggy/.rbenv/shims/bundle",
          "pathToRDebugIDE": "/Users/iggy/.rbenv/versions/2.6.6/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/ruby-debug-ide-0.7.2",
          "program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/rails",
          "args": [
              "server"
          ]
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that you have to update &lt;code&gt;pathToRDebugIDE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pathToBundler&lt;/code&gt; with your own paths. I'll explain below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bundler-debugger-and-adapter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bundler, Debugger, and Adapter
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three things that you need to provide Vimspector with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path to bundler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path to the debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which adapter to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the path for &lt;code&gt;pathToBundler&lt;/code&gt;, run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;which bundler
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my case, it returns &lt;code&gt;/User/iggy/.rbenv/shims/bundle&lt;/code&gt;. Use whatever path your machine uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have installed the ruby-debug-ide gem via your Rails' Gemfile, to get the &lt;code&gt;pathToRDebugIDE&lt;/code&gt; path, run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle show ruby-debug-ide
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my case, it returns &lt;code&gt;/Users/iggy/.rbenv/versions/2.6.6/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/ruby-debug-ide-0.7.2&lt;/code&gt;. Use whatever path you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, recall that Vimspector requires a special adapter for each language / environment you use (in my previous article, I installed  adapters - also known as "gadgets" - for node and chrome). Since we're debugging a Ruby framework, we need a Ruby adapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adding-a-ruby-adapter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adding a Ruby Adapter
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the Vimspector config file above, you'll see:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"adapter": "cust_vscode-ruby",
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Ruby is not in one of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector#supported-languages"&gt;supported languages in the Vimspector page&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;darn it!&lt;/em&gt;). Don't worry, if you dig the Vimspector repo deep enough, you will find instructions on how to "install" a Ruby gadget there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/wiki/languages#ruby-gadget-installer-file"&gt;the page&lt;/a&gt; with information for languages not officially mentioned in the README. If you scroll down, you'll find an instruction for Ruby. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the instruction on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/wiki/languages#introduction"&gt;introduction section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inside the Vimspector &lt;em&gt;directory&lt;/em&gt; (in my case, it is in &lt;code&gt;~/.vim/plugged/vimspector/gadgets/custom/cust_vscode-ruby.json&lt;/code&gt; - yours could be in a different directory depending on what plugin manager you use), add a custom  json file for your language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;./install_gadget.py --upgrade&lt;/code&gt;. Vimspector should install some files from &lt;code&gt;vscode-ruby&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew! We are done with the preliminary setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're still curious what just happened, here are a few pages to read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/wiki/languages#ruby-gadget-installer-file"&gt;Ruby gadget installer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/main/docs/debugger.md"&gt;VSCode-Ruby Debugger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#program-and-args"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Program and Args
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take another look at a section inside the Vimspector config file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"program": "${workspaceRoot}/bin/rails",
"args": [
  "server"
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recall from the previous article, &lt;code&gt;program&lt;/code&gt; is the program that Vimspector will run when you tell it to launch something and &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; is the argument that gets passed to &lt;code&gt;program&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running a rails app, you would (usually) run &lt;code&gt;bin/rails server&lt;/code&gt;. The config does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#running-the-vimspector"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Running the Vimspector
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to run Vimspector. Our config is set to &lt;code&gt;launch&lt;/code&gt;, so do not run &lt;code&gt;rails s&lt;/code&gt; from the terminal. We will run it from the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;code&gt;says_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; and add a breakpoint on &lt;code&gt;@time&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SaysController &amp;lt; ApplicationController
  def hello
    @time = DateTime.now # add a breakpoint here
    @greetings = "Greetings"
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excellent. Now here comes the moment of truth - let's launch Vimspector!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a few seconds, you should see on the &lt;code&gt;Console&lt;/code&gt; window that Vimspector is launching a Rails app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, visit &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/says/hello"&gt;http://localhost:3000/says/hello&lt;/a&gt;. The app should pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check your Vimspector. You should see it paused at the breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GCMydpQJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4h9k7qgp4wzm6kf59202.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GCMydpQJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4h9k7qgp4wzm6kf59202.png" alt="Rails Vimspector Launch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is what you see, congratulations! You've successfully launched a Rails debugger - from Vim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, you can step into, step over, and step out of different lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#attach-vs-launch"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Attach Vs Launch
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you can run Vimspector: attach and launch. The former attaches the debugger into an already running process. The latter launches a process from the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rails example above is an example of launch, as it launches a Rails process directly from the debugger. Theoretically, you should be able to perform either attach or launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#attaching-a-debugger-to-a-rails-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Attaching a Debugger to a Rails Server
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've seen how to launch a Rails app from Vimspector. Let's see how you can attach Vimspector to a Rails process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, modify our &lt;code&gt;.vimspector.json&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "configurations": {
    "rails": {
      "adapter": "cust_vscode-ruby",
      "default": true,
      "configuration": {
          "name": "Debug Rails server",
          "type": "Ruby",
          "request": "attach",
          "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
          "remoteHost": "0.0.0.0",
          "remotePort": "1234",
          "pathToBundler": "/Users/iggy/.rbenv/shims/bundle",
          "pathToRDebugIDE": "/Users/iggy/.rbenv/versions/2.6.6/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/ruby-debug-ide-0.7.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; is now &lt;code&gt;attach&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added &lt;code&gt;remoteHost&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remotePort&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We removed &lt;code&gt;"programs"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"args"&lt;/code&gt; (they are unnecessary for attach).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;remoteHost&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remotePort&lt;/code&gt; are the IP address and port number that we will be running the debugger on. The host is set to &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; and the port is set to &lt;code&gt;1234&lt;/code&gt;. These numbers will make sense in a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your &lt;code&gt;vimspector.json&lt;/code&gt; file is configured, let's run the app. Instead of running the regular &lt;code&gt;bin/rails s&lt;/code&gt;, run:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rdebug-ide --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1234 --dispatcher-port 1234 -- bin/rails s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will launch the &lt;code&gt;ruby-debug-ide&lt;/code&gt; program installed earlier. Note the host and port numbers: we are running the debugger on host &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; and port &lt;code&gt;1234&lt;/code&gt; in addition to running the rails server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, add the breakpoints inside the &lt;code&gt;says_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; file, then launch Vimspector. Since we are running Vimspector on attach mode, it won't launch a Rails server this time. Head to the page related to this controller: &lt;a href="http://localhost:3000/says/hello"&gt;http://localhost:3000/says/hello&lt;/a&gt;. Watch your Vimspector pauses at the breakpoint(s). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0xbtwVR4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hc1gtnt8hxs19brnu45k.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0xbtwVR4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hc1gtnt8hxs19brnu45k.png" alt="Rails Vimspector Attach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweet chocolate pancake! Super cool, isn't it? Well, this also concludes this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You've successfully debugged a Rails app. You are one step closer from becoming a supreme master developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still much to explore about Vimspector and Rails applications. There are different settings, environments, and configs that I don't mention in this article. Experiment. Share this article. Let me know how you do things differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I hope that this article has given you a good place to start. Happy Vimming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stand up for yourself and for your values
</title>
      <author>Sandor Dargo</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:00:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sandordargo/stand-up-for-yourself-and-for-your-values-j8c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sandordargo/stand-up-for-yourself-and-for-your-values-j8c</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you might know, I'm writing a book, its working title is "&lt;a href="https://dev.to/sandordargo/the-seniority-trap-20bn"&gt;The Seniority Trap&lt;/a&gt;". From time to time, I'll post some parts of it, before it gets released. If you are interested in the updates, please &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/gvcv1j"&gt;subscribe to my personal blog&lt;/a&gt; and let's connect on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SandorDargo"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you want to grow, if you really want to be a senior on the team, you cannot hide. Even if you are not a born leader and you don't plan to become the shepherd of your team, you cannot live in the shadow when people - including you - are hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to stand up to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-a-leader-an-individual-contributor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be a leader __ an individual contributor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you fill in the empty space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you say that you should be a leader &lt;strong&gt;rather than&lt;/strong&gt; an individual contributor? Or you don't really know, you are hesitating whether you should be one &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; the other. If you are ambitious, but not having a job right now, you might even say be a leader &lt;strong&gt;or at least&lt;/strong&gt; an individual contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are not into the managerial path, I have something better in mind for you. Be a leader and an individual contributor at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to mix up the meaning of a boss, a manager and a leader. I have to remind you that a manager is not necessarily a leader. I'm sure you already noticed this in your career. If not, you are a lucky one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--umkXocPN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pvhqxxou966mbrufa2jq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--umkXocPN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pvhqxxou966mbrufa2jq.png" alt="Leader vs Manager: Key Traits To Adopt by Princewill Akuma"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way around is also true. A leader is not necessarily a manager. You can be a leader without having real authority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's what you should aim for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't say that you should not become a manager. Maybe you should. But first, become a leader and then look for formal authority. If you really want it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;What would you choose? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you prefer to feel unhappy about your work, about your project knowing that you didn't try to do everything that was under your control? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or would you deal with the fact that not everyone likes you because you stood up when you had something to say in order to save the project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn't choose the second one, think about it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a people pleaser, if you want everyone to like you, you'll fail anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already failed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like people whose sole aim is to make sure that everyone likes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a solid path to failure and unhappiness and I don't like people who simply take the low road and walk into a trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worry not, speaking up is not always about yourself, but it's often about the team, about the greater good. Or maybe just for another person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, speaking up simply means that you don't let someone "bully" a junior. You don't let someone with no authority basically order someone inexperienced which meeting she can go to and what she should do instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll be soon seen as a natural leader. Despite the fact that there are no natural leaders. Leadership is a learned skill that certain people start very early in their lives. As you gain experience, you can become a leader. Note, that I still don't write about becoming a manager, but a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference implies that you can still stay an individual contributor. But you'll be seen as someone who still leads the team. This can be dangerous in an environment filled with insecure managers. They might feel threatened, so you have to manage up and make sure you don't make them feel that you want their authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes even if you speak up, even if you are right and it would benefit the others as well, you'll not win. You'll still be seen as someone with principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in any area of life, sometimes you'll have to accept defeats. Other times, you'll have to compromise. If your points are never taken, probably you should look for another place where you fit in more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-burn-all-the-bridges"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don't burn all the bridges
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you always have to fight, if you do nothing but standing up for your values, there are two possibilities. Maybe the problem is you and you simply want to control too much. Though that's a different problem that we are not discussing in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is that you are not at the right place. Your workplace is not necessarily bad, but you have a value mismatch. In that case, the best thing you can do is leaving. You are not going to change the whole world and who wants to live in a constant conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your values are not for sale, your values are not about compromises. They are part of you, they are part of your integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how to leave then? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if not everyone has to like you, it's important not to burn all the bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking it's not possible after all those conflicts, think about it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already agreed that as adults we should take ownership of our acts. So if we cannot leave on good terms, that's our fault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I wrote many times that you should always take ownership. If you cannot leave on good terms, that's your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you'll not stay on good terms with everyone, but if you mess up with everyone, it won't be everyone else's fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be that someone is a jerk. Maybe your manager had different views on management and professional relationships than you. It's okay. You think you were right and maybe you were, but you can still step back and leave on good terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you choose to be still very clear on your points and leave with making them even clearer. You know if it's burning that bridge. But maybe it would burn only one bridge and not all the bridges with the rest of the people. Sometimes sacrificing one bridge can strengthen the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize that even if you decide to burn some bridges - but not all - it will be your decision, your "fault", but a consciously chosen one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you left, you're left, you're out. You should close that chapter of your life. Both physically and emotionally. Do not speak in a bad way about your previous bosses. Probably you shouldn't speak them about at all. For you, they are dead. Do we share bad stories about dead people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's enough to share that you had some differences and you decided to go on different paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, most around you will know why you left and they will find you extremely elegant. Even without speaking in a bad manner, you can convey your message simply by not speaking about certain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will act more classy and people will still understand you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#respect-your-values"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Respect your values
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat your values, like you'd like others to treat them. Treat them with respect. Take your stand, respecting your core values and keeping your integrity will always pay off in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you lose your own respect, you lose everything. That's the surest way to a downward spiral. Hence keeping your integrity will at least make sure that your spine is still in its place and you can look into the mirror when you get up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't mean that this is the easier way in the short run, but the obstacles in our lives appear to show us the way we should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I participated in a temporary project. We joined from different parts of the company for 6 months to build a minimal viable product. Six months is barely enough to form a team, but it was enough to lay down the foundations of a new product that later proved to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, I "fought" a lot with about half of the team. Certain people spoke way too much every morning at the daily standup, we went over the 15 minutes by far and not only because we always started late as the scrum master was always late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the case for regular meetings. In fact, for every fucking meeting the same people couldn't manage to show up on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made sure that I don't compromise on my values. I was there at every meeting on time, demonstrating what I believe in. Whenever we were running out of time, I raised my hand and reminded ourselves that it's time to conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During retrospectives, I brought up the problem. Even though certain people admitted that it's a real issue, the root causes didn't want to participate in the solution. The solution - to my problem - would have been changing their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when about half of the team followed the principles of the daily standup and were on time at the meetings, it didn't change the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was rather interesting and at the end, we had to make a decision whether we'd be interested to join the new department permanently or we would prefer to go back to our original teams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to understand from the rest of the team who wants to stay, but most were hesitating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way our team operated on a daily basis was in such a deep conflict with my core values that I couldn't risk working with a scrum master being the main contributor to my problems. I decided not to join the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, he didn't join either. But it was not a big deal. I didn't want to take such a risk. It was not a risk of failure it was a risk to work where my must rules could not be met. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, life had to offer something even better for me later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These few months I spent on the project was a great opportunity for me to live up to my values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People noticed it as they called me the timekeeper and I left with grace, I even made a few good connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure that at least Fabien, our scrum master, didn't like me much, but again, as I already said, not everyone has to like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing up for your values will make you grow as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you might lose some friends. Let me assure you, they were not your real friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you lose your job. Yes, we live in such times, you can easily lose your job if you don't follow the mainstream opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-it-worth-having-conflicts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is it worth having conflicts?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's remember for a moment what Dale Carnegie said about arguments. It's best to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's definitely not worth going into all the conflicts. It's not worth taking care of all the problems of our society, even if your feeling of justice would make you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't bend your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the Stoics, in particular Cato, the Younger. He chose death over accepting the delusively conciliatory hand of Caesar. He didn't just refuse to compromise, Cato almost defeated Caesar and changed the course of history. Almost. Yet, he didn't bend his back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think also about practising acceptance and calmness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think whether something is in your own power to change or not. You watch the news and you are outraged because of the president, or the incapable opposition, or maybe because of Covid. You are ranting about it over the dinner table instead of asking your kids what they learnt that day or your spouse whether she had a good day at work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you do anything about it? You can vote, you can be an activist, but it's not worth changing your mood in reaction to all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept that what you can do about those things are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, recognize what is in your power. Not accepting the harmful environment created by your management is definitely in your power. You can always change jobs or at least you can resign as you're not a slave. You might have the feeling of being a slave of the corporation, but you have all the right to resign and not just feel resigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, taking your stand will not be so brutal as it was for Cato. You just have to share, you have to explain what you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing the way is your obligation both towards yourself and the coming generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard, but we have to accept that we are not perfect and we made mistakes. It's not your boss's fault that you got passed over in the promotions again. It's not the CI/CD's fault that you broke production once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's you and you have to find what to do. Sometimes you'll have to act on your own. Other times, you'll have to stand up for your values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll be seen more and more as a leader and not just a senior professional. Especially if you don't only stand up for yourself, but for others as well. At the same time, make sure that you don't navigate yourself into a position where you cannot do on a day to day basis what makes you tick. In short, don't get trapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't read the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/krtirtho/nestjs-the-framework-of-nodejs-part-1-gl7"&gt;part-1&lt;/a&gt;, please first read that else you'll feel this given information is out of context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part-2, I'll be discussing Nestjs Modules, Circular Dependency, Guards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Modules
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part-1, there was a smidge description of modules. Modules in Nestjs aren't global instead it has depth. But can be shared across any other modules too. Though it supports Global Module like Angular, it is more recommended to keep Services/Controllers in the module where they're mostly used in Nestjs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time modules will be generated through the NestCLI &amp;amp; providers/controllers generated in that module's context will get automatically added by the CLI. These are called &lt;em&gt;feature modules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a module example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hi.module.ts //////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./hi.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hi.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hello.module.ts//////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./hello.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hello.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../hi/hi.module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;@Module&lt;/code&gt; decorator's &lt;code&gt;controllers&lt;/code&gt; array-property is used for all the &lt;em&gt;controllers&lt;/em&gt; that the module uses or all the classes decorated with the &lt;code&gt;@Controller&lt;/code&gt; decorator. The &lt;code&gt;providers&lt;/code&gt; property is used for &lt;code&gt;service&lt;/code&gt; or classes that are decorated with an &lt;code&gt;@Injectable&lt;/code&gt; decorator. Remember, anything &lt;em&gt;Injectable&lt;/em&gt; is a provider &amp;amp; you've to put it in &lt;code&gt;providers&lt;/code&gt; field to be able to inject/use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt; property is used to export/expose the providers that can be shared with other modules. Put any providers that you want to inject/use in other modules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;imports&lt;/code&gt; property is the exact opposite of &lt;code&gt;exports&lt;/code&gt;. To be able to use/inject any external providers in a provider/controller of another module, you've to add that exported provider's module in the &lt;code&gt;imports&lt;/code&gt; field of another module&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-circular-dependency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Circular Dependency
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times you want to use a provider in another module's provider &amp;amp; another modules' provider in that provider/controller. In this case, it creates a circular dependency. Circular dependencies can arise in Nest between modules and between providers. One should always try best to avoid Circular Dependency in Nestjs but sometimes it's not possible. In this case, &lt;code&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt;  &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;@Inject&lt;/code&gt; parameter decorator comes handy for providers which are within the same module context&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of using &lt;code&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt; accross providers from same module to resolve circular dependency:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// bye.service.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./hello.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// injecting HelloService&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;helloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBye&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`bye bye, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// it uses `helloService` &amp;amp; is within same module&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;helloServiceUsingMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;helloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;bye&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// hello.service.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./bye.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// injecting ByeService&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;byeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`hello for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;byeServiceUsingMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;byeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBye&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ....other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's add newly created &lt;code&gt;ByeService&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;em&gt;/hello&lt;/em&gt; module or &lt;code&gt;HelloModule&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;providers&lt;/code&gt; field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hello.module.ts //////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// import stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./bye.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// new bye-service added&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, what about providers that are from the external modules? No worries, just do like above for the providers &amp;amp; just use &lt;code&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;imports&lt;/code&gt; field of both modules to import each other's providers in their context&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of forwarding ref of external providers across modules:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hi.module.ts //////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./hi.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hi.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../hello/hello.module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// importing HelloMoule using forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="na"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// exporting hi-service for using in hello-service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hello.module.ts//////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./hello.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hello.controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../hi/hi.module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./bye.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ByeService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// exporting hello-service for using in hi-service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that both module's providers are available in each other's scope, let's use &lt;code&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt; in their providers &lt;code&gt;HelloService&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;HiService&lt;/code&gt; to resolve their circular dependence:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// hello.service.ts //////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../hi/hi.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .... other properties/methods&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// just like provider-scoped circular dependency&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HiService&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`hello for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// a method that uses `hiService`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiServiceUsingMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hiService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .... other properties/methods&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// hi.service.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../hello/hello.service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .... other properties/methods&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forwardRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;helloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloService&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`hi for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// a method that uses `helloService`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;helloServiceUsingMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;helloService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// .... other properties/methods&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your code does not depend on which constructor is called first as the order of instantiation of these provider classes are indeterminate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an advanced alternative to &lt;code&gt;forwardRef&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;ModuleRef&lt;/code&gt; class is provided from &lt;code&gt;@nestjs/core&lt;/code&gt; for dynamically instantiating both static and scoped providers. It can be mainly used to navigate the internal list of providers and obtain a reference to any provider using its injection token as a lookup key. &lt;code&gt;ModuleRef&lt;/code&gt; can be injected into a class in the normal way. Learn more about &lt;code&gt;[ModuleRef](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-guards"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Guards
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Nestjs docs, Guards have a &lt;em&gt;single responsibility.&lt;/em&gt; It's their job to determine if a request will be handled by the controller or not depending on certain conditions (Specifically user-defined logic). It's useful for authentication/authorization &amp;amp; is the recommended way to handle authentication/authorization in Nestjs. Though authentication/permissions etc.. can be done with &lt;code&gt;middleware&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; is done in express or other HTTP servers as these don't have connected strong context &amp;amp; need no reason to know about which method will be used to handle the request. Middlewares only have the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; function, nothing else thus it's kinda dumb for Nestjs. But Guards have access to the execution context. It's designed more like exception filters, pipes &amp;amp; interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guards are executed after each middleware but before any interceptor or pipe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guards are a kind of provider as its class also needs to be annotated with &lt;code&gt;@Injectable&lt;/code&gt; decorator but it has to implement interface &lt;code&gt;CanActivate&lt;/code&gt; or provide the method &lt;code&gt;canActivate&lt;/code&gt; in case of JS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time authentication will be handled using &lt;code&gt;passport&lt;/code&gt; or similar libraries. And Nestjs docs has an explanation of how to use &lt;code&gt;passport&lt;/code&gt; to make a &lt;em&gt;Authentication flow&lt;/em&gt; in Nestjs &lt;a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Here, this &lt;code&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/code&gt; is usable but not production safe. Just using it for demonstration purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of an &lt;code&gt;AuthGaurd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// auth.guard.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CanActivate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;rxjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validateToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CanActivate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canActivate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// gives access to the express/fastify request object&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;switchToHttp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// jwt/any kind of token&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hearders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// no token no entry&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;validateToken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just like exception-filter/pipes you can use Guards in &lt;em&gt;method-scope/controller-scope&lt;/em&gt; using &lt;code&gt;@UseGaurds()&lt;/code&gt; decorator. It can take any amount of Guards as its arguments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;method-scoped Guard example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hello.controller.ts ///////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... import stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;UseGuards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/commmon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../../guards/auth.guard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ..... other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/restricted-data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;UseGuards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// or pass it already being instantated as `new AuthGuard()`                             &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getRestrictedData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if it doesn't require dependency injection&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... logic&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ..... other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, you can assign new properties to the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; object in the Guard &amp;amp; can access it through &lt;code&gt;@Req()&lt;/code&gt; parameter-decorator in any Controller route handler such as &lt;code&gt;getRestrictedData&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;HelloController&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like pipes/exception-filters, you can use Guards globally with the app's &lt;code&gt;useGlobalGaurds&lt;/code&gt; method. Then no need to use &lt;code&gt;@UseGaurds()&lt;/code&gt; for each controller/handler that requires that Guard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of global guards:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// main.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...import stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./guards/auth.guard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useGlobalGuards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it'll throw an error if you're using/injecting other providers inside that Guard. But if you want to keep both dependency-injection &amp;amp; global scope then providing it through global &lt;code&gt;AppModule&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp;  then setting it as a global guard will work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DI capable Global Guard:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// app.module.ts //////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...import other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./guards/auth.guard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// unique key/id for selecting the gaurd from within the NestFactory instance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AUTH_GUARD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;unqiue-auth-guard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="na"&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;provide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AUTH_GUARD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;useClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// main.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...import stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AUTH_GUARD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./app.module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;authGuard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AUTH_GUARD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useGlobalGuards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;authGuard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, there another problem arises. How will one make a route public/unrestricted from this Guard? This is where the &lt;code&gt;Reflector&lt;/code&gt; comes in handy. It's a special class provided by &lt;code&gt;@nestjs/core&lt;/code&gt; that can be accessed in any &lt;em&gt;module-scoped&lt;/em&gt; providers/controllers or simply, in any controller/provider/guard/exception-filter/interceptor/pipe that isn't instantiated globally&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;Reflector&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@SetMetadata()&lt;/code&gt; decorator &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;custom-decorator&lt;/em&gt; we can simply handle this case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@SetMetadata()&lt;/code&gt; is a both method &amp;amp; class decorator provided by &lt;code&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; can be used to set special &lt;code&gt;key-value metadata&lt;/code&gt; for a method/class &amp;amp; this can be accessed through the &lt;code&gt;Reflector&lt;/code&gt; that is injected in every &lt;code&gt;@Injectable()&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;@Controller()&lt;/code&gt; available in &lt;code&gt;AppModule&lt;/code&gt;'s context&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom Decorator example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;///// public.decorator.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SetMetadata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IS_PUBLIC_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;THIS_ROUTE_IS_PUBLIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// decorators are functions inside function with access to extra metadata provided &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// by the JSVM (JavaScript Interpreter). So you can ovbiously call &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// a decorator in a function like normal functions but just remember to `return` it to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// let the decorator's inner function to access those metadata about the class/method/parameter/property&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// its currently being applied to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SetMetadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IS_PUBLIC_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// the decorator flow-&amp;gt; `Public` is a function which returns &amp;amp; calls `SetMetadata`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// function which also returns &amp;amp; calls an inner function within it. Its called&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// **function-currying**&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// More on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;code&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;canActivate&lt;/code&gt; method lets get the metadata of currently active class/method in context:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// auth.guard.ts /////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...import stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reflector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@nestjs/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;IS_PUBLIC_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./decorators/public.decorator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CanActivate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// just add the Reflector as a type&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reflector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Reflector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;canActivate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Observable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// accessing the passed metadata with its unique key/id&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// within the current execution context&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isPublic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reflector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getAllAndOverride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;IS_PUBLIC_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isPublic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... other validation logic/stuff&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we only have the job to apply the custom &lt;code&gt;@Public()&lt;/code&gt; method/class decorator in a route to make it &lt;em&gt;unrestricted.&lt;/em&gt; If you've read &lt;strong&gt;part-1&lt;/strong&gt; then you know that &lt;code&gt;HelloController&lt;/code&gt; (created in part-1) has a GET /hello route that responds with hello on request. But for the &lt;code&gt;AuthGuard&lt;/code&gt;, that route will be restricted. But what in the world should make someone not getting &lt;em&gt;a warm hello&lt;/em&gt;?!. So let's make it open to everyone:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;////// hello.controller.ts ///////&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... import stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../decorators/public.decorator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;HelloController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ..... other stuff&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now everyone gets a hello ;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;replyHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ... logic&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ..... other stuff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's the complete application with today's update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/hello-world-forked-7xkln"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After update, All the routes except &lt;code&gt;/hello&lt;/code&gt; will return&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"statusCode"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;403&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"message"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Forbidden resource"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"error"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Forbidden"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Providing any jwt-token in this &lt;code&gt;Bearer &amp;lt;token&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; format with request-header's  &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; field will make the protected routes work for now&lt;/p&gt;
