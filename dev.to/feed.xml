      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bias for action is a principle that appears in many leadership principle lists of companies, like Amazon. Let us explore what it means and how software engineers apply this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-bias-for-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Bias for action?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business, time is money. Many judgments and acts can be reversed and do not need in-depth research. Risk-taking is something that is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As software engineers, we have to take risks, decisions and need to judge decisions all the time. This depends of course on seniority and your current level, but in any job as a software engineer - even if you do not work at Amazon - you will show this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle can also be described as a calculated risk. Not every decision will be the right one but with a bit of data, you can measure the risk of each option for doing a specific task. If the risk is acceptable you should be open to taking any path that leads to completion of the task, ideally with the lowest friction. If it was wrong, then change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/login"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ooM7uLiu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n9gripjcgj0w24q8gxpk.gif" alt="A simple way to your promotion" width="800" height="201"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characteristics making out a person that fits this leadership principle are consisting of different things. For once, we have the doer. When considering "Bias for action" people that are not scared of doing mistakes will show this leadership principle more. They are willing to do certain things without overthinking. They take the risks required which other people might not take. Additionally, they will also have the courage to own the outcome when taking an action. If the action might lead to failure, they are there to fix it, iterate, improve and maybe iterate based on the action. True ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-companies-use-bias-for-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which companies use Bias for action?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to Amazon there is GitHub who is uses a similar principle called "Ship to learn". It is similar to the details of "Bias for Action" by Amazon. So here is a short list with all the companies using this principle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/tools/career-ladders-explorer/amazon-2020"&gt;Amazon: Bias For action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/tools/career-ladders-explorer/github-2020"&gt;GitHub: Ship to Learn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/tools/career-ladders-explorer"&gt;And others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a lot more companies adapting leadership principles "Bias for action" will become more important. Companies also get more technical and analyze the impact they have, making sure that you can pivot from your initial decision if it does not work out. So let us check what software engineers can do in detail to show this leadership principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#situations-for-bias-for-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Situations for Bias for action
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, you might ask yourself initially where you show bias for action. It is really difficult when you think about it but there are a lot of opportunities and day-to-day activities where you show this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#during-arguments"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  During arguments
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A situation where it is quite common to use "Bias for action" is in discussions with the team. It could be any discussion on how to implement a specific feature. Or talking about a past decision on what went wrong. Often, participants in the discussion do not focus on the actions they can take from the discussion but because they like to discuss. In these situations, the leadership principle can be applied. Disagreeing and focusing on actually taking an action, even if you do not agree with it necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#decisioning-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Decisioning Process
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--plkegc9s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/204j7hpe3otxloei7xvv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--plkegc9s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/204j7hpe3otxloei7xvv.png" alt="A group of people deciding for a feature" width="880" height="371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the last chapter, most decision processes will be decided based upon discussions. In any way, as software engineers, we will also have the ability to make decisions ourselves. Especially because as a software engineer you will most likely have access to the data to make the decisions. If you know in a meeting that a discussion might help to take any action, but to take a really good decision it will take a bit more time to gather data, delay the decision. The action will be to get more data to make sure whatever action you will take, will make the whole process a success for your customer. To the person or organization, you are writing software for. Push for this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#helping-people-to-make-decisions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Helping people to make decisions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about discussions, you mostly think about yourself and how you interact in the discussion. But it is also important to put yourself into the other participants' perspective. If you understand the other person and make sure their voice, their concerns, and their decisions are well respected, it is the first step to making good decisions. You can help to convince them of your ideas by giving them a little nudge, to rethink approaches. For example, this works well with gathering data on the problem and presenting it to them. It might make them rethink their decision and take action instead of just arguing with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-you-measure-bias-for-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do you measure Bias for action?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this article you probably want to know what you have done which relates to this principle. But first, let us check how we can measure Bias for action. It is probably one of the leadership principles that is the most difficult to track. But what you can do is &lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/blog/3-brag-document-templates-google-docs"&gt;create a brag document&lt;/a&gt; every week or month and write down the situations when you took a risk rather than waiting out on deciding something. The more detailed timeline you have of the discussion and decision processes the easier it will get for you to summarize where you acted based on this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lQyouyIC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1p8efiertt9hvn3cbec.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lQyouyIC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1p8efiertt9hvn3cbec.png" alt="Writing a brag document" width="880" height="371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good tip is to keep a brag document with getworkrecognized and keep records of when you showed a bias for action so you can reference it in the future. With getworkrecgonized, you can keep a diary of all your achievements at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples-of-how-to-apply-bias-for-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Examples of how to apply Bias for action
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers show bias for action most of the time by default. But pinpointing specific examples in your career is always feeling difficult. In the following section, we list some examples where bias for action can be shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solutions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solutions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a solution to solve a problem can be applied to many problems. It can be a technical problem but also a team problem, but we will discover them later in this chapter. In general, solutions should be built minimal. When a problem arises try to focus on thinking of an MVP - a minimum viable product. So to say. A better term would be probably a minimum viable solution that fixes the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#feature-discussions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Feature Discussions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions about product features are probably the most common one for software engineers to be involved in. For example, it could be a simple discussion of which user interface is better and should be chosen for the next feature. A lot of preferences come into play here like personal experience with UI and experiences at your old company how they have done things. Most of the time an A/B test can help with actually choosing the right UI. Instead of arguing which UI is better, focus on actually choosing a metric that will help you to see which is the better UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is purely technical feature discussions. For example, like choosing the right database type for your new application or service. For such decisions, the principle "Bias for action" might not be applied because database migrations are difficult to do in the long term. So you should be still open to listening to other people's opinions but decide on the best long-term solution. Be careful of the risks of your decisions. Note them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/login"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ooM7uLiu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n9gripjcgj0w24q8gxpk.gif" alt="A simple way to your promotion" width="800" height="201"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different situation can occur during sprint planning with your team. Which feature should you focus on? Normally sprints are taking 2 weeks and there is a goal for the sprint to achieve. People hesitate about what to choose normally and what has the highest impact. Gather data on the impact and effort to finish the different projects, which are also called epics in some companies. With that, you can measure the risk of actually delivering a feature within a sprint and measure the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#team-issues"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Team Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern and agile teams follow some sort of sprints. What most of the sprints have in common is a retrospective at the end of each cycle of the sprint. During this meeting, the participants discuss the last cycle and what can be done better. But more importantly, they discuss concrete actions that can improve the team's health and performance. The focus should be on actions rather than discussing the issues. Sometimes though, discussing the issue will clear up specific arguments, so feel free to discuss from time to time, but push the participants of the meeting to take action and remind them that sometimes it is ok to disagree if you have any action and can measure the success in future retros. Especially if the issue is not critical to running your current team's processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mentoring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mentoring
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An engineer will have many opportunities to mentor other employees in the company. More junior people need a helping hand from time to time with easy but also difficult problems. More senior people need guidance on how to navigate the product the best, how to contribute, and what are core parts of the code are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cEDjWG4C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7giy2utk4ch5i5gzq69f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cEDjWG4C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7giy2utk4ch5i5gzq69f.png" alt="A person teaching a group of other people" width="880" height="371"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During mentoring it is important that you can tell the other person that you do not know everything and if you get into a situation where you do not have an answer to a question, you can simply answer you do not know. But it is important to also give them the feeling that if they fail with their actions, failures are appreciated because you can learn from them. This is the most important part. Push them for a decision soon and let them reevaluate if it does not work out. An important part though is to encourage them to also gather some data around their issue, and see if what they thought is right, is working out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#meetings"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Meetings
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle can be also shown in meetings. As we learned in the discussions chapter before it is important to take action from a meeting. What you can do to push this action-taking and make it quicker is to just research some data regarding the meeting before the actual meeting. Take 30-60 minutes the next time before a meeting and gather data around the issues that will appear. It will help to drive your meeting forward. And even if the meeting does not go in the direction of actions, take an action to gather data around the issue to see if there is any impact. We also wrote &lt;a href="https://getworkrecognized.com/blog/structured-meetings-get-you-promoted"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; on how to structure your meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#documentation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Documentation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing documentation comes short most of the time for developers. A problem that many software engineers have is that they can't put themself into another perspective. So the reader of the documentation will suffer. It is good to create some personas for your documentation and then write the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to roll out this documentation quickly and gather feedback. Most of the time some documentation is better than none. Take action and write that piece of documentation everyone is needing. For internal customers or external customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bias for action is a weird leadership principle. It is not clear immediately how this principle is actually manifested in your work and especially in interviews at Amazon, it might be weird to answer this question. Find one of the examples above in your work and prepare them for the interview. And feel free to track your work with getworkrecognized. It will help you to figure out your actions towards "Bias for action".&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building UIs in Figma with hand movements</title>
      <author>Charlie Gerard</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 20:44:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/devdevcharlie/building-uis-in-figma-with-hand-movements-3pi4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/devdevcharlie/building-uis-in-figma-with-hand-movements-3pi4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post originally shared on my &lt;a href="https://charliegerard.dev"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the release of the latest version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/hand-pose-detection"&gt;MediaPipe handpose detection&lt;/a&gt; machine learning model that allows the detection of multiple hands, I've had in mind to try to use it to create UIs, and here's the result of a quick prototype built in a few hours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzV2ngmbiBw"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting this, I also came across 2 projects mixing TensorFlow.js and Figma, one by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adispezio/status/1440153362872221701"&gt;Anthony DiSpezio to turn gestures into emojis&lt;/a&gt; and one by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sidahuj/status/1440705845973512195"&gt;Siddharth Ahuja to move Figma's canvas with hand gestures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never made a Figma plugin before but decided to look into it to see if I could build one to design UIs using hand movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to know is that you can't test your plugins in the web version so you need to install the Desktop version while you're developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, even though you have access to some Web APIs in a plugin, access to the camera and microphone isn't allowed, for security reasons, so I had to figure out how to send the hand data to the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I went about it is using &lt;a href="https://socket.io/"&gt;Socket.io&lt;/a&gt; to run a separate web app that handles the hand detection and send specific events to my Figma plugin via websockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick visualization of the architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nkFkQYe8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o9wprstm7yfx9esybjgo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nkFkQYe8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o9wprstm7yfx9esybjgo.png" alt="A web app is running the hand detection with TensorFlow.js, sends events such as pinch or zoom to the express server with socket.io running on port 8080. The Figma plugin is listening on the same port to the zoom event and when received, triggers different actions in the Figma UI." width="880" height="615"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gesture-detection-with-tensorflowjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Gesture detection with TensorFlow.js
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my separate web app, I am running &lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js"&gt;TensorFlow.js&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/hand-pose-detection"&gt;hand pose detection model&lt;/a&gt; to get the coordinates of my hands and fingers on the screen and create some custom gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much details, here's a code sample for the "zoom" gesture:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftThumbTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightThumbTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftIndexTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightIndexTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftIndexFingerDip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightIndexFingerDip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightMiddleFingerDip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightRingFingerDip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightMiddleFingerTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftMiddleFingerTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftMiddleFingerDip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftRingFingerTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;leftRingFingerDip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;rightRingFingerTip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hands&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;handedness&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//---------------&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// DETECT PALM&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This code looks a bit messy but that's intended. The goal was to validate the hypothesis that this solution would work before spending some time improving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did in this sample was checking that the y coordinate of the tips of my index, middle finger and ring finger was smaller than the y coordinate of their dip cause it would mean my fingers are straight so I'm doing some kind of "palm" gesture.&lt;br&gt;
Once it is detected, I'm emitting a "zoom" event and sending the difference in x coordinate between my right middle finger and left middle finger to represent some kind of width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#express-server-with-socketio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Express server with socket.io
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server side uses &lt;code&gt;express&lt;/code&gt; to serve my front-end files and &lt;code&gt;socket.io&lt;/code&gt; to receive and emit messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a code sample of the server listening for the &lt;code&gt;zoom&lt;/code&gt; event and emitting it to other applications.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Server&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;socket.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a user connected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;listening on *:8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#figma-plugin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Figma plugin
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Figma side, there's two parts. A &lt;code&gt;ui.html&lt;/code&gt; file is usually responsible for showing the UI of the plugin and a &lt;code&gt;code.js&lt;/code&gt; file is reponsible for the logic.&lt;br&gt;
My html file starts the socket connection by listening to the same port as the one used in my Express server and sends the events to my JavaScript file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here's a sample to implement the "Zoom" functionality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;ui.html&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/4.4.1/socket.io.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ws://localhost:8080&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;transports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;websocket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Zoom zoom&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;postMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;pluginMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;code.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;showUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;__html__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ui&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onmessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Messages sent from ui.html&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;normalizedZoom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;normalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;figma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;viewport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;normalizedZoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;normalize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Figma docs, the zoom level needs to be a number between 0 and 1, so I am normalizing the coordinates I get from the hand detection app to be a value between 0 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I move my hands closer or further apart, I am zooming in or out on the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c71uSx7H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ewfigpcdyuin51apewe0.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c71uSx7H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ewfigpcdyuin51apewe0.gif" alt="Gif showing me moving my hands closer and further apart to zoom in and out of a UI design" width="880" height="519"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty quick walkthrough but from there, any custom gesture from the frontend can be sent to Figma and used to trigger layers, create shapes, change colors, etc!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to run a separate app to be able to do this is not optimal but I doubt Figma will ever enable access to the &lt;code&gt;getUserMedia&lt;/code&gt; Web API in a plugin so in the meantime, that was an interesting workaround to figure out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Como funciona o encoding no protocolo HTTP?</title>
      <author>wrongbyte</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 20:25:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/wrongbyte/como-funciona-o-encoding-no-protocolo-http-94f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/wrongbyte/como-funciona-o-encoding-no-protocolo-http-94f</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... ou: o que acontece com os bytes das requisições HTTP quando você se comunica com alguns servidores?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#antes-um-pouco-de-contexto"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Antes, um pouco de contexto...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando temos um arquivo grande e precisamos mandá-lo para alguém, o que vem na nossa cabeça de imediato é &lt;em&gt;“zipar”&lt;/em&gt; este arquivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando &lt;em&gt;zipamos&lt;/em&gt;, isto é, comprimimos um arquivo, o que estamos fazendo na realidade &lt;del&gt;(de forma simplificada, é claro)&lt;/del&gt; é aplicar um &lt;strong&gt;algoritmo de compressão&lt;/strong&gt; nos seus bytes. O que esses algoritmos fazem é diminuir a redundância da sequência de bytes que compõe o arquivo, utilizando de referências como ponteiros onde ocorrem sequências que já se repetem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mas-qual-a-rela%C3%A7%C3%A3o-entre-esses-algoritmos-e-o-protocolo-http"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mas qual a relação entre esses algoritmos e o protocolo HTTP?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine que você deseja fazer um GET request para um site, por exemplo para &lt;a href="http://example.org"&gt;http://example.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
No seu browser, você vai ver a seguinte página, interpretada pelo seu browser:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dyv1209r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gt3t8q20lvryghcx62m8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dyv1209r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gt3t8q20lvryghcx62m8.png" alt="Site normal" width="824" height="522"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contudo, o que você de fato recebe do servidor é uma &lt;strong&gt;enorme stream contendo o código-fonte da página&lt;/strong&gt;, após as headers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MqtsBZ3O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wtq2n6c7nngf6taw83ho.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MqtsBZ3O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wtq2n6c7nngf6taw83ho.png" alt="Código fonte do site" width="880" height="521"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logo transferir o conteúdo de páginas contendo uma quantidade extensa de dados torna-se pouco efetivo, tanto para o cliente quanto para o servidor. &lt;strong&gt;A partir disso, podemos então "zipar" a resposta que recebemos. Ao fazer isso, diminuímos o tamanho da resposta, que vem comprimida, e assim aumentamos a eficiência da comunicação.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#como-isso-ocorre"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Como isso ocorre?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalmente, a resposta é comprimida utilizando-se do algoritmo &lt;strong&gt;gzip&lt;/strong&gt;, mas isso vai depender do servidor. &lt;br&gt;
Antes da aplicação efetiva do algoritmo de compressão, ocorre a chamada "negociação" entre o browser e o servidor: &lt;strong&gt;o browser envia a header &lt;code&gt;accept-encoding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; com o algoritmo suportado (exemplo: &lt;code&gt;Accept-Encoding: gzip&lt;/code&gt;) e &lt;strong&gt;o server responde com a header &lt;code&gt;content-encoding&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; com o algoritmo escolhido.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WTVtor61--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b3zumzo1mutvmyh6z7sp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WTVtor61--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b3zumzo1mutvmyh6z7sp.png" alt="Negociação HTTTP" width="778" height="339"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Obs: nesse caso, usamos a header &lt;code&gt;Vary&lt;/code&gt; para armazenar em cache os diferentes valores para o encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dessa forma, as headers &lt;code&gt;Accept-Encoding&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;Content-Encoding&lt;/code&gt; vão definir o algoritmo de compressão escolhido para diminuir o tamanho dos arquivos sendo transferidos na comunicação. Isso é de extrema importância para tornar o uso da conexão mais eficiente.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#mas-%C3%A9-poss%C3%ADvel-otimizar-ainda-mais-a-comunica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-atrav%C3%A9s-do-uso-de-outra-header-raw-transferencoding-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Mas é possível otimizar ainda mais a comunicação através do uso de outra header: &lt;code&gt;Transfer-Encoding&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando recebemos a resposta do servidor, recebemos o que é chamado de "payload". Isso é a resposta que pode ser, como já vimos acima, uma página HTML por exemplo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JJfnIp0m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x2yrsfwc86m5l6aauyqz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JJfnIp0m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x2yrsfwc86m5l6aauyqz.png" alt="payload" width="278" height="120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definition of payload : The "actual data" in a packet or file minus all headers attached for transport and minus all descriptive meta-data. In a network packet, headers are appended to the payload for transport and then discarded at their destination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contudo, é possível "dividir" esse payload, e isso ocorre quando utilizamos da header &lt;code&gt;transfer-encoding&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Quando essa header não é utilizada, o payload body e message body são iguais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exemplo da resposta vista antes, porém com transfer-encoding:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C2ShjD7g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bl300b8gih3mv37xjilu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C2ShjD7g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bl300b8gih3mv37xjilu.png" alt="chunked response" width="357" height="281"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ou seja, as respostas com transfer-encoding seguem a seguinte estrutura:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u2NX3Fg---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7pc1mu71szfb49yb5q9i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u2NX3Fg---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7pc1mu71szfb49yb5q9i.png" alt="estrutura" width="177" height="144"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Isso divide as informações recebidas em &lt;strong&gt;chunks&lt;/strong&gt;, ou seja, "pedaços" de dados. Isso, além de ajudar a diminuir a carga da comunicação, ajuda o servidor a manter uma conexão mesmo para conteúdos gerados dinamicamente.&lt;br&gt;
Em muitos servidores, é comum ocorrer a combinação de Content-Encoding: gzip + Transfer-Encoding: chunked, por tornarem a comunicação mais eficiente.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello there 🙋‍♀️&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be sharing the basic steps on how to configure AWS with terraform using Ubuntu. If you're a beginner, this will definitely save you some time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here we go... Yayyy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey...&lt;strong&gt;You need to have an AWS account&lt;/strong&gt; you might want to try the free access account as a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to download your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;VMware workstation pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Make sure it is the latest version of Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;). It is quite heavy and takes a very long time to download and install this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to remember your Credentials (Username and Password) while installing your VMware. Note, this is very important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should get this after installation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It starts from here;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--192NQwik--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/73l9v90oggp5ah9xndo9.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--192NQwik--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/73l9v90oggp5ah9xndo9.PNG" alt="Image description" width="494" height="445"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and ends here...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---l3EROk9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n2v0qe3nvkz64945ijyx.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---l3EROk9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n2v0qe3nvkz64945ijyx.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="509"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow this steps clearly, you should get &lt;strong&gt;terraform installed on your VMware workstation pro&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are the steps in order;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your platform, search for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;terminal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; then click on it to get started. Now run the following commands;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. wget &lt;a href="https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.3/terraform_1.1.3_linux_amd64.zip"&gt;https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.3/terraform_1.1.3_linux_amd64.zip&lt;/a&gt; (always confirm the latest version)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. sudo apt-get install zip -y&lt;/strong&gt; (Sudo means superuser do or substitute user do)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. unzip terraform*.zip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. terraform --version&lt;/strong&gt;  or &lt;strong&gt;terraform -v&lt;/strong&gt; (this will give you the version of terraform you installed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. mkdir  /terraform&lt;/strong&gt; (this has to do with directory)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. cd /terraform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. vim config.tf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should get this after running those commands;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7CF-wLGQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5fixlx45tyipr9lrh5em.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7CF-wLGQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5fixlx45tyipr9lrh5em.jpg" alt="Image description" width="607" height="722"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have gotten this far...Kudos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. You have to fill this in for configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;provider "aws" {&lt;br&gt;
  project     = "my-project-id"&lt;br&gt;
  region      = "us-central1"&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can leave the page by clicking on (esc ,then shift and : then type wq) with this you can leave the page, so as to go back to continue with deployment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Now run terraform innit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now log in to the AWS Management Console&lt;/strong&gt; click on your name on the dashboard, scroll down to security credentials. Copy the Access keys(access key ID and secret access key)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1qx4dWhD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ciuxxl26matme7nreog.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1qx4dWhD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ciuxxl26matme7nreog.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="438"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_3a9FYVX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u0aaqmfp9it8ywv23gaf.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_3a9FYVX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u0aaqmfp9it8ywv23gaf.PNG" alt="Image description" width="880" height="440"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. sudo snap install aws-cli --classic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. aws configure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;fill all the required credentials here&lt;/em&gt; (credentials from step 10)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. mkdir  /terraform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. cd /terraform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. touch main.tf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure to fill in this command, it should appear like this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zMLkuzqX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/48lvgok5va92dimfe61f.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zMLkuzqX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/48lvgok5va92dimfe61f.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="727" height="554"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Now run terraform innit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. terraform plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. terraform apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now go to your AWS Console to check your deployment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is all!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VriRxY3c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rhjagrjbd25dakd2xo9t.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VriRxY3c--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rhjagrjbd25dakd2xo9t.jpg" alt="Image description" width="591" height="591"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;well done...  If you have gotten this far, Kudos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you on my next blog&lt;/em&gt;👊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React.js Core Concepts</title>
      <author>Suresh Pal Pranta</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:16:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/pranta07/reactjs-core-concepts-51ha</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/pranta07/reactjs-core-concepts-51ha</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reactjs-and-its-pros-amp-cons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React.js and its pros &amp;amp; cons
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.&lt;br&gt;
Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use virtual DOM to effectively render user interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports component-based design which is reusable and easy to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single page application means rendering different components on the same page efficiently without any reload. Which makes a better user experience. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HTML-like syntax is easy to learn and use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuously updated features which is a bit challenging for developers to cope up with new documentation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still contains class-based components example in documentation instead of functional components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#jsx"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JSX
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSX means JavaScript XML which allows HTML-like syntax with JavaScript in react. Using JSX we can create dynamic content in our react application easily. Without JSX the code is a bit lengthy and complex while using JSX the code is simple and easy to understand. Babel is used by React to convert the JSX to React elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
const Blogs = () =&amp;gt; {
    return (
        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;img
                src="https://i.ibb.co/2SfqRWr/maxresdefault.jpg"
                alt=""
                width="100%"
            /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    );
};

export default Blogs;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the above code snippet inside the return statement it looks like html syntax actually it is JSX notation which makes us easier to understand what our code structure will looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#virtual-dom"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Virtual DOM
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a virtual representation or copy of the real DOM object. Whenever anything changes in our document react will create a new virtual DOM and compare it with the previous DOM, find out the change between these two DOMs using diff algorithm and finally update the specific changes into the real DOM without updating the entire dom. This makes DOM-manipulation more effective without updating the entire DOM whenever a small part of the DOM is changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#props-and-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Props and State
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Props are mainly used for passing dynamic data from parent component to child components while the state is a variable that is used to store information about a specific component and that can be changed dynamically. Props are read-only and immutable which means we can not change props. When the state changes re-render will happen dynamically.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
const Blogs = () =&amp;gt; {
    const blogs = ["blog1","blog2","blog3","blog4","blog5",]
    return (
        blogs.map(blogTitle =&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Blog title={blogTitle}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Blog&amp;gt;)
    );
};
export default Blogs;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import React from "react";
const Blog = (props) =&amp;gt; {
    const {title} = props;
    return (
        &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{title}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    );
};
export default Blog;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lifting-state-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lifting State Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot pass states from child to parent component. React follows a top-down approach for passing state between many level components. When a parent component needs the state we need to lift the state up to the parent component and pass this as a prop to the child components. This is called &lt;code&gt;lifting state up&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#props-drilling-and-context-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Props Drilling and Context API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data are passed from component to component by props on a deeper level this is called props drilling.&lt;br&gt;
The best way to pass data 4-5 layers down is using context API. Context API is used to pass multiple data all over the document which is simple and easy to use. Whenever we need to share multiple data between many level components we can use context API to provide those data to the whole document. &lt;br&gt;
First, we have to create a context then we have to wrap our document between context Providers where we should specify the value we want to pass. We can get the value we provide from anywhere with the help of &lt;code&gt;useContext&lt;/code&gt; hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#custom-hook"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Custom hook
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooks are mainly a JavaScript function that can perform some task and returns the results we need. Building our own custom hook will help us to simplify our code which is easy to understand. For creating a custom hook we have to create a JavaScript function and export it so that it can be imported from any component we want and use it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { useState } from "react";

const useProducts = () =&amp;gt; {
    const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
    fetch(url)
    .then(res =&amp;gt; res.json())
    .then(data =&amp;gt; setProducts(data));
    return { products };
};

export default useProducts;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const products = useProducts();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance-optimization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To optimize a react.js app we should try to divide different parts of our application into smaller chunks, use react fragments to avoid unnecessary elements for wrapping, try to avoid using an index as a key for the map, using useMemo, pure component, use of spread operator, passing object as props, etc. which will prevent unnecessary component re-render in React.js.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using GitHub Codespaces with VNC/flexbox to create Pokémon maps from a web browser</title>
      <author>lowlighter 🦑</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:55:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lowlighter/using-github-codespaces-with-vncflexbox-to-create-pokemon-maps-from-a-web-browser-3ch6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lowlighter/using-github-codespaces-with-vncflexbox-to-create-pokemon-maps-from-a-web-browser-3ch6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there 👋 !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on a cool project, &lt;a href="https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea"&gt;&lt;code&gt;🌺 Gracidea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is an animated Pokémon live web map aiming to recreate the whole Pokémon world while being accessible directly from your browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jUtbE0Cn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lyf7bw0x2tm9kbqsw8x7.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jUtbE0Cn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lyf7bw0x2tm9kbqsw8x7.gif" alt="Gracidea preview" width="600" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a combination of several technologies, like &lt;a href="//deno.land"&gt;deno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pixijs.com"&gt;pixi.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://vercel.com"&gt;vercel.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mapeditor.org"&gt;Tiled map editor&lt;/a&gt; along additional other tools. Some of these, like Tiled, are graphical desktop apps so they need to be installed first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which made wonder, what if it was possible to provide a graphic environment to access desktop apps and edit maps directly from a web browser... 🤔 ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is 🥳 !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know, GitHub offers &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces"&gt;codespaces&lt;/a&gt; which lets you spawn a web-accessible docker instance from a repository with VS Code pre-installed. However, not many people know that it is actually possible to configure the dockerfile through the &lt;code&gt;.devcontainer&lt;/code&gt; folder of said repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sh0g9--i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/84lvivmxh4bg8ozwxcyg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sh0g9--i--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/84lvivmxh4bg8ozwxcyg.png" alt="Codespaces" width="880" height="479"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ℹ️ Note: Seems that this feature is in closed beta for users accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing a bit with &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/blob/main/script-library/docs/desktop-lite.md"&gt;Microsoft's vscode-dev-containers' lightweight desktop&lt;/a&gt; I achieved to configure vnc and flexbox (the provided desktop env) to spawn a full-screen instance of Tiled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below's a preview of the whole thing, in Firefox (yes, everything is happening in the browser !😮)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gQi4b4NI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/78ctqtvyjxlgpkjry90e.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gQi4b4NI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/78ctqtvyjxlgpkjry90e.gif" alt="Codespaces preview" width="600" height="339"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, basically all you need to setup this project now is just a web browser, no headaches caused by "but it works on my machine 😵 !"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in the required code to make this works, it is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea/tree/main/.devcontainer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading 💕 !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git Cheat Sheet 📄 (50 commands + Free PDF and poster)</title>
      <author>Danny Adams</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:49:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/doabledanny/git-cheat-sheet-50-commands-free-pdf-and-poster-4gcn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/doabledanny/git-cheat-sheet-50-commands-free-pdf-and-poster-4gcn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was tired of looking up the same common Git commands - so I made a cheat sheet that I could print and put on my office wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cheat sheet contains 50 commonly used Git commands on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undoing things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing your repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stashing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronising local and remote repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#free-git-commands-cheat-sheet-pdf"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  FREE Git Commands Cheat Sheet PDF
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One page PDF to make it easy to copy and paste in commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doabledanny.gumroad.com/l/git-commands-cheat-sheet-pdf"&gt;Download the free Git Commands Cheat Sheet PDF here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both PDF and poster are available in Light Mode and Dark Mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zib71Fgv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n082uxea33j6zq3mca7u.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Zib71Fgv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n082uxea33j6zq3mca7u.png" alt="Git cheat sheet poster in light mode" width="880" height="660"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w-UEE2WQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8cl1lotlaikqp8vhhr6i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--w-UEE2WQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8cl1lotlaikqp8vhhr6i.png" alt="Git cheat sheet poster in dark mode" width="880" height="660"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#git-cheat-sheet-poster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Git Cheat Sheet Poster
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Order a physical A3 poster for your office wall - so you can quickly look up commands, and keep them at the top of your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes in thick durable paper, and a matte, light-absorbing finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doabledanny.gumroad.com/l/git-cheat-sheet-poster"&gt;Order a Git Cheat Sheet Poster here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's mine on my office wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUn-4X_T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/60mjbucqvp3ojsq0fowy.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUn-4X_T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/60mjbucqvp3ojsq0fowy.jpg" alt="The Git cheat sheet poster on my office wall" width="880" height="660"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are all of the commands from the cheat sheet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the name and email that will be attached to your commits and tags&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git config &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--global&lt;/span&gt; user.name &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Danny Adams"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git config &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--global&lt;/span&gt; user.email &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"myemail@gmail.com"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starting-a-project-with-git"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Starting a Project with Git
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a local repo (omit &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to initialise the current directory as a git repo)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git init &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Download a remote repo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git clone &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#make-a-change"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Make a Change
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a file to staging&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stage all files&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git add &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commit all staged files to git&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"commit message"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add all changes made to tracked files &amp;amp; commit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git commit &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-am&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"commit message"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-git-concepts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic Git Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt;: default development branch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;origin&lt;/strong&gt;: default upstream repo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HEAD&lt;/strong&gt;: current branch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HEAD^&lt;/strong&gt;: parent of HEAD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HEAD~4&lt;/strong&gt;: great-great grandparent of HEAD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#branches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Branches
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List all local branches. Add &lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt; flag to show all remote branches. &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; flag for all branches.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git branch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new branch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git branch &amp;lt;new-branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Switch to a branch &amp;amp; update the working directory&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git checkout &amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new branch and switch to it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git checkout &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;newbranch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delete a merged branch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delete a branch, whether merged or&lt;br&gt;
not&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add a tag to current commit (often used for new version releases)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git tag &amp;lt;tag-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#merging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Merging
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merge branch &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; into branch &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. Add &lt;code&gt;--no-ff&lt;/code&gt; option for no-fast-forward merge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-4I6vZM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2zpi27oxqws7j39iaxs2.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P-4I6vZM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2zpi27oxqws7j39iaxs2.PNG" alt="fast-forward vs no-fast-forward merge in Git" width="594" height="429"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git checkout b

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git merge a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Merge &amp;amp; squash all commits into one new commit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git merge &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--squash&lt;/span&gt; a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rebasing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rebasing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebase feature branch onto main (to incorporate new changes made to main). Prevents unnecessary merge commits into feature, keeping history clean&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6pTlAeTV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/99lln9qgsiiwz8w18vdp.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6pTlAeTV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/99lln9qgsiiwz8w18vdp.PNG" alt="Rebasing feature onto main in Git" width="634" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git checkout feature

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git rebase main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interactively clean up a branches commits before rebasing onto main&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git rebase &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interactively rebase the last 3 commits on current branch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git rebase &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; Head~3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#undoing-things"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Undoing Things
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move (&amp;amp;/or rename) a file &amp;amp; stage move&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git &lt;span class="nb"&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;existing_path&amp;gt; &amp;lt;new_path&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remove a file from working directory &amp;amp; staging area, then stage the removal&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remove from staging area only&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--cached&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;View a previous commit (READ only)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git checkout &amp;lt;commit_ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create a new commit, reverting the changes from a specified commit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git revert &amp;lt;commit_ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Go back to a previous commit &amp;amp; delete all commits ahead of it (revert is safer). Add &lt;code&gt;--hard&lt;/code&gt; flag to also delete workspace changes (BE VERY CAREFUL)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git reset &amp;lt;commit_ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#review-your-repo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Review your Repo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List new or modified files not yet committed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;List commit history, with respective IDs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git log &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--oneline&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Show changes to unstaged files. For changes to staged files, add &lt;code&gt;--cached&lt;/code&gt; option&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git diff
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Show changes between two commits&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git diff commit1_ID commit2_ID
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stashing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stashing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Store modified &amp;amp; staged changes. To include untracked files, add &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; flag. For untracked &amp;amp; ignored files, add &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As above, but add a comment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash save &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"comment"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partial stash. Stash just a single file, a collection of files, or individual changes from within files&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;List all stashes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Re-apply the stash without deleting it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash apply
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Re-apply the stash at index 2, then delete it from the stash list. Omit &lt;code&gt;stash@{n}&lt;/code&gt; to pop the most recent stash.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash pop stash@&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Show the diff summary of stash 1. Pass the &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; flag to see the full diff.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash show stash@&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delete stash at index 1. Omit &lt;code&gt;stash@{n}&lt;/code&gt; to delete last stash made&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash drop stash@&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Delete all stashes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git stash clear
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#synchronizing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Synchronizing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a remote repo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git remote add &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;View all remote connections. Add &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; flag to view urls.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git remote
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remove a connection&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git remote remove &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rename a connection&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git remote rename &amp;lt;old&amp;gt; &amp;lt;new&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fetch all branches from remote repo (no merge)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git fetch &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fetch a specific branch&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git fetch &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fetch the remote repo's copy of the current branch, then merge&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git pull
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Move (rebase) your local changes onto the top of new changes made to the remote repo (for clean, linear history)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git pull &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--rebase&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upload local content to remote repo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git push &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upload to a branch (can then pull request)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;git push &amp;lt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Public Speaking Class with Josh Constine</title>
      <author>Ali</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/endingwithali/public-speaking-class-with-josh-constine-1jjo</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/endingwithali/public-speaking-class-with-josh-constine-1jjo</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the chance to sit down in a small setting with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoshConstine"&gt;Josh Constine&lt;/a&gt;, to learn about how to be a better public speaker and better moderator. I wrote notes voraciously, and wanted to share them with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EXVq0bGA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642702273742/R_VjFmoOE.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EXVq0bGA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1642702273742/R_VjFmoOE.jpeg" alt="a group of gas station members listening to josh talk" width="880" height="572"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you sound slower than you think when you’re speaking, but still &lt;strong&gt;try to speak a bit slower&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the slower you speak, the less filler words you use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you sound more dignified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your brain can keep up with the words you’re saying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;strong&gt;dynamic tone&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasize words that matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take pauses at end of sentences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;finish your sentence&lt;/strong&gt;” - make sure you come to the end of your sentence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ask questions with a finite ending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeps speaker on edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;put the context at the start of the question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Web3 is growing big... how do you get speaking gigs?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;instead of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“how do you get speaking gigs? now that web3 is blowing up, there are more opportunities to find talks” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;never answer for your panelist&lt;/strong&gt; - if they don't answer right away, let them have the time / give them the space to think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's not on you as the moderator, to rescue the speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as a speaker, &lt;strong&gt;keep the answer hard and specific to the question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not dilute the speaker’s question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulating good answers take time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;small gestures on stage are actually really distracting → try and stay motionless&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a little bit of gesture / posture change as a moderator is ok, but fidgeting is really noticeable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you ask tough questions, be sure to &lt;strong&gt;ask in an empathetic tone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps break down walls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as a panelist, have 3 points you want to keep going back to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prepare beforehand of what these three points will be - have a strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you don’t know the answer to a question asked, you can lead back to these 3 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 points is easy for an audience to remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you’re being interviewed - &lt;strong&gt;prepare the interviewer with points you want to talk about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps shape the direction of the conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you need a prompt / interview helper, &lt;strong&gt;do not use your phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better to have an analog prompt (piece of paper, notebook, index card, etc) to help with answering question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 &lt;strong&gt;interviewer pro-tip&lt;/strong&gt; - read the last few tweets of the person you’re interviewing! It will help you be relatable, also might be able to tie into the talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;listen to previous works / talks of the interviewee&lt;/strong&gt; → you can tie it into your questioning, and allows for deeper conversations / questions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t have to be the whole thing, just a small snippet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;pre-write your jokes&lt;/strong&gt;, even if they’re not funny

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the audience will relax because bad jokes are still good jokes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prep calls are counter productive

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vibe doesn't carry over to the interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audience wasn’t there, so if you refer to something from the prep call, audience wont understand the context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;email threads &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; phone calls &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommendation: have 2-3x more questions than needed

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you will have flexibility and no stress of filling the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have list of questions ordered by themes

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allows for organic flow of conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;don’t give exact questions to speakers beforehand&lt;/strong&gt; because they’ll write canned / PR friendly answers

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instead give topics and subtopics you expect to touch on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can get people to talk about “thorny” or hard topics by asking them three times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feel free to use “critics have said ____ how do you respond” or “people on twitter have said _____, what do you think?” to ask hard/edgy questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always know your next questions → no dead time on stage as the interviewer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you have a large number of speakers

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start lightening round of questions to get speakers talking / riff

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this also hooks in the listeners / audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;later you can ask to share a little bit more about their background and to answer a question at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personal and biographical questions help audience relate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Give a quick 10 second intro and then answer what’s your favorite DAO right now?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get to the meat and potatoes of the talk in the beginning of the talk to be sure to give enough time for deep conversations and answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t be afraid to shut down long winded speakers

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is your duty as a moderator to the audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;redirect to another person if they’re talking too much or back to a topic if they’re off topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;end panels with something future facing - “what's next?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do recaps - Josh likes to do recaps at the ends of talks

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;takes notes mid talk quickly (using analog means) to do recap for later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helps keep audience’s memory fresh of what was covered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very impressive skill to speaker bookers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;moderator or speaker, you should do this

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;josh literally will do this as a speaker by grabbing the mic and announcing things to recap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a good question ordering as a moderator

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speed round&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personal/autobiographical question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tactical question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;challenging question if needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;future looking question &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;twitter spaces - talks do better with closed speaker loops and then allowing external listeners to ask questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;breaking open shy speakers by giving them an easy question to start with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#q-and-a"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Q and A:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it took Josh 4 years to start getting paid

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how bad do they need you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as a reminder, you have a lot more leverage last minute for getting paid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typically you want them to throw out the first number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking for gigs → you can probably get paid if a conference has paid tickets and sponsorships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find your core piece of credibility - “i made this and that’s why you want me to speak”

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assemble your references / sources and have them easily available for people to find&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the hardest speakers to find right now are keynote speakers

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a topic you care about and turn it into a 20 minute presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conferences want keynote speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when do you  feel like you have mastery / competency to talk publicly about a subject?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💪 “Fake it till you make it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how to get competency about a subject to publicly speak about it, quickly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get an advisor network to give advice, future insights, and to ask what are the current heated topics / debates in the field

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get experts to tell you their insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read a few blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formulate a new opinion after absorbing all this information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;good keynotes have stats, lenses, and insights about a topic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really engaging discussion, and I'm excited to share these notes with you. Thank you Josh for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk to us! &lt;/p&gt;

      <author>Akanksha Bhasin</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:22:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/symbldotai/conversation-intelligence-quest-python-ci-challenge-5h91</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/symbldotai/conversation-intelligence-quest-python-ci-challenge-5h91</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Out Your Python Skills on Building Conversation Intelligence Functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey fellow devs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce a new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/SymblCIQuest-Q1"&gt;Python CI coding challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Qualified.io&lt;/em&gt;. Put your Python skills to the test and win some cool prizes and bragging rights by building conversation intelligence functions. In case you are not familiar with what Conversation Intelligence (CI) is, it’s essentially AI that can understand natural human conversations, explicitly and contextually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-challenge"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📜 The Challenge:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this cool challenge, you will take on the identity of a “Python Agent’ and venture into the mystic land of Convotopia. Combining your Python skills and CI APIs (provided by Symbl.ai), you will build functions for extracting the undiscovered secrets (conversation insights) hidden deep within Convotopia. Prepare yourself to take on greater challenges as you venture deeper into Convotopia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is divided into 5 Levels, with each passing level you gain super powers to unlock the next level and be a Python hero in Convotopia.⛳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start the challenge here: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/SymblCIQuest-Q1"&gt;bit.ly/SymblCIQuest-Q1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#time-commitment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⏳ Time Commitment:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge will take approximately 1 hour and 30 mins (or less) to complete all levels, depending on your level of expertise with Python and/or conversation intelligence APIs (provided by Symbl.ai). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you commit 1.5 hours of your life? You can win some cool prizes completing the challenge (see section below for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Approx time for each level:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Access to Convotopia Land - 20 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Connect with the locals - 20 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you connecting with the locals? - 20 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4.&lt;/strong&gt; Let the extraction begin -  30 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 5.&lt;/strong&gt; What is the ‘Talk of the town’ in Convotopia? - 30 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Day 10 Of #100DaysOfCode Challenge - My experience</title>
      <author>Cate</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:22:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/catevee/day-10-of-100daysofcode-challenge-my-experience-2250</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/catevee/day-10-of-100daysofcode-challenge-my-experience-2250</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just completed 10 days of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Although the whole of last week I didn't code due to unavoidable circumstances, the good part is that I was awarded a full software development scholarship. I will be starting my lessons this Feb for the next 6 months, I'm really excited.&lt;br&gt;
So, here is what I learned in those 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JS functions, objects, classes, Arrays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JS callback methods, async, and promises - although I didn't understand these very well. I will be going through them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed Frontend Mentor Challenges - Html &amp;amp; Css - newbie level and today I started the junior level. I'm proud of myself about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coding for only one hour a day seems very short to me. I usually use a pomodoro app to time myself, but after 1 hour is over, I let myself code until I can't take it anymore. So, I usually code for more than 3 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually post my daily report on Twitter and there is a very great supportive community their, and a lot of people doing the same 100daysofcode challenge. This motivates me to continue coding without giving up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those 10 days have made me realise that I love coding. Seeing myself build a wesite component from scratch is my biggest joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you on day 20, as I share my great coding journey.&lt;/p&gt;
