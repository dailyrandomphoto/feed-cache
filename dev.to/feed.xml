      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I start this blog post I would like to thank the Dev team for shouting me out on Twitter! It meant a lot and I truly appreciate it! Now, welcome to my blog post about me contributing to another developers open source project and how you can possibly find a fun project to work on as well! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-a-project-to-work-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding a Project to Work on
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this open source project by networking through my classes Slack to look for a partner. I ended up finding &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/drew5494"&gt;@drew5494&lt;/a&gt;
 who was also writing a static site generator in C++. If you are looking for a project to work on, you should try finding one on &lt;a href="https://github.com/trending"&gt;GitHub Trending&lt;/a&gt; or you can try commenting your favourite open source project for others to find! I was a little nervous to test and review a project in a language that I don't program in very often but, nothing wrong with broadening your horizon! Open source should be filled with learning and fun so don’t be afraid to try new things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-and-reviewing-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing and Reviewing Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I had to do a little review of C++ so I could get a stronger understanding of the code. Once I had a grasp of the code I conducted some tests to see if the features would work or break under certain situations. I noticed that I found bugs/problems a lot faster than I usually would in my own code. This experience really showed me that not only is it important to have your code reviewed but, having a fresh brain while reviewing projects makes debugging and testing one million times easier! Best advice I have read within the tech community was “If you are stuck, go for a walk and try again” it will save you the ten hours of staring at a screen because of a typo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some problems I found while reviewing were:&lt;br&gt;
*README didn’t contain tool features or examples &lt;br&gt;
*The input flag did not work with directories&lt;br&gt;
*The input flag work with text files only in the same directory of the executable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-review-on-octo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Review On Octo
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting my code reviewed was very scary at first. Putting your code out in the open can be daunting but, will help you improve your skills as a developer. The one issue that surprised me the most was the version flag not working. It surprised me not because of why it did not work but, why did it work on my machine? The problem was I had a string in my version variable in my package.json. I was able to fix it by just removing the string and creating a custom yargs statement. The only other issue reported on my project was adding liquid tag support to the tool. That feature was recommended on my &lt;a href="https://dev.to/luigizaccagnini/open-source-static-site-generator-3953"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt; post by &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/pandademic"&gt;@pandademic&lt;/a&gt;
 . Thanks a lot for the recommendation! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I have learned that testing and reviewing is imperative for the growth of a developer. Testing and reviewing helps developers learn new things, understand how to work with other developers and allows developers to try new things! What are some of your first issues you worked on in an open source project? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the links to both repository issues:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;

      <title>Learnings from release 0.1</title>
      <author>Ritik Bheda</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:20:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ritikbheda/learnings-from-release-0-1-14no</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ritikbheda/learnings-from-release-0-1-14no</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I am back and this week I have my experience and learnings to share on a project I worked this week. The project was to release version 0.0.1 of a Static Site Generator tool I am making for my course at Seneca College. The tool can take commandline input of text files or folders and generate html files for the same. More information about the tool and its uses can found in this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg-release-0-0-1-1mlp"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a really great experience working on this project as I got a profound understanding on commandline tools, npm and Node.js development. The process also gave me a better experience using git and GitHub. Later, I found an amazing(luckily) partner &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067"&gt;Tuan Tan&lt;/a&gt; who is highly skilled at backend development and to be more specific, Node.js development. We met on our class Slack channel where he posted that he is looking for a partner and then I approached him for the same. We both helped each other by reviewing and testing each others code and finding possible areas of improvement on each others project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvising-tuans-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improvising Tuan's Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it was very new for me to test review someone’s code as I was doing it for the first time, but I found myself comfortable and confident enough to test his work after reading this &lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067/build-a-command-line-tool-that-converts-txt-to-html-3je5"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; in which he explains how to use his tool. The tool documentation being so good, it was easy for me to install, run and test in my local machine. Well, everything worked perfectly and according to the requirements, and that did not surprise me, but the surprising part was it was done so amazingly that it gave a hard time to find 3 issues in the code! &lt;br&gt;
The 2 of the 3 issues I found were related to commandline options and the third one was related to version. The options part had an &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/5"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; that the output on the terminal was not align which I according to me, if improvised can give a better look of using the whole tools. The second &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/3"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; regarding options was that the tool was using commandline arguments as program variables instead of options. Improving this can make the work easier for the developer and can also make the work more organized. The final &lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/4"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was related to the tool version. The program was not able to pick the &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file which gave an error when I tried seeing the version number through the commandline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#issues-in-my-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Issues in my Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also helped me in reviewing and testing my code. I was eager for him creating issues so that I can work on them and improve my tool. His issues did not surprise me as I was sure I might have made a few mistakes during the development.&lt;br&gt;
He was able to find 3 issues in my code as well! He found issues of a typo, picking version from the file and program giving errors in special cases. I had a typing mistake in my code where I misspelled ‘successfully’ to ‘successfullly’. The issue can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The second &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/1"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; was versioning related as he suggested me to pick the program version from package.json which could reduce programmers work manually updating it in every file that uses it. And the last &lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg/issues/3"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; he found was input file/folder related in which he entered a file which did not exist. Instead of my program warning the user, it created an empty folder which was never expected. I later worked on all the 3 issues and resolved them ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-takeaways"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that everyone has different thinking style and approach to a problem. I learned how my thinking style affects the problem I am working on. I also learned from his experience on the projects testing and reviewing about Node.js development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#links"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Links
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find the project and lab related these links helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067"&gt;Tuan's blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda/commandline-ssg"&gt;My repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ritikbheda"&gt;My GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>SSG for generating html</title>
      <author>jsong89</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 03:17:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/ssg-for-generating-html-2eib</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/juuuuuuun/ssg-for-generating-html-2eib</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSD600&lt;/strong&gt; feels like a subject that composes a program (?) on a specific topic by mobilizing everything that has been learned so far. In the first week, instructions were released to create release 0.1, and I tried to tailor the code as best as possible to the requirements of that list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating the api, I chose node js, which I was most confident and used the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I created a repository in Git and named it "jun-ssg" after me. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-ssg-for-text-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The SSG for text file!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source Project 0.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jun-ssg is a simple html generator. You can extract your file contents and put them as HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before start to use&lt;br&gt;
After downloaded files delete the package-lock.json&lt;br&gt;
run "npm install" at terminal&lt;br&gt;
You can dowload and run the repository files -node src/app.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can run by npm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm i -g &lt;a href="https://github.com/juuuuuuun/jun-ssg.git"&gt;https://github.com/juuuuuuun/jun-ssg.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example statements&lt;br&gt;
Options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-i, --input Input a file or a directory [string] [required]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-o, --output Specify the output directory [string]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-s, --stylesheet Import css URL [string]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-v, --version Show version number [boolean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-h, --help Show usage information [boolean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples: After install my package, jun-ssg -i 'Silver Blaze.txt'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloning my repository&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UsCPbKK3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ljpioxhj5y1x77sau6w.png" alt="1"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After complete the cloning terminal should show like this&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i65RlVkj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l4wgsq3p2ukftnzbuasl.png" alt="2"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the dir location to the cloned folder&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UrylB25a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/697udi8h3vbuex6gz8wf.png" alt="3"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run "npm install" to use pre-set npm modules&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUSQQDlY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q49q02gjqxz6momm2ojl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nUSQQDlY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q49q02gjqxz6momm2ojl.png" alt="4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to run "node src/app.js" if everything is fine the terminal should show how to use this api.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUx3bS3r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fp6v4utel61e3thoo89t.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XUx3bS3r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fp6v4utel61e3thoo89t.png" alt="5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type any command which is set, but in this case will run -input option type "node src/app.js -i 'Sherlock-Holmes-Selected-Stories'".&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1zG6JxgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vegjcm7qwhs3441u5hd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1zG6JxgL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0vegjcm7qwhs3441u5hd.png" alt="6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check generated htmls.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mkg01tA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vizppsak96u3s5o07pq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mkg01tA4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8vizppsak96u3s5o07pq.png" alt="7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, you can apply any css stylesheet like this way.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajgbtADk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8saqdx6ipjtotrgu794.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ajgbtADk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8saqdx6ipjtotrgu794.png" alt="8"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can see the htmls with nice design :)&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvNbbVH2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nvevrr4lui0wllrcheq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvNbbVH2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4nvevrr4lui0wllrcheq.png" alt="9"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text file what you wished.&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pdq51OVC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u20bvotlne1mylgv85ih.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Pdq51OVC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u20bvotlne1mylgv85ih.png" alt="10"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Review nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;Lock EJF351BLK</title>
      <author>Hana Do</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 02:41:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hanado2801/review-noi-chien-khong-dau-locklock-ejf351blk-185p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hanado2801/review-noi-chien-khong-dau-locklock-ejf351blk-185p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://locknlockvietnam.com.vn/noi-chien-khong-dau/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ngay từ khi xuất hiện đã trở thành món đồ không thể thiếu trong bếp của mỗi gia đình. Với công nghệ làm chín hiện đại, nồi chiên Lock&amp;amp;Lock dầu giúp người dùng được thỏa mãn đam mê thưởng thức những món đồ chiên rán mà không phải hấp thụ quá nhiều chất béo từ dầu mỡ. Trong đó, nổi bật là sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK được đánh giá là một trong những sản phẩm được ưa chuộng nhất của thương hiệu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-n%E1%BB%93i-chi%C3%AAn-kh%C3%B4ng-d%E1%BA%A7u-lockamplock-ejf351blk-c%C3%B3-%C4%91%C3%A1ng-s%E1%BB%AD-d%E1%BB%A5ng"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK có đáng sử dụng?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Để đánh giá sản phẩm có tốt hay không, trước tiên hãy cùng chúng tôi tìm hiểu những tính năng, đặc điểm của sản phẩm nhé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-v%E1%BB%81-thi%E1%BA%BFt-k%E1%BA%BF"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.1. Về thiết kế&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sản phẩm được thiết kế với hình bầu dục to tròn. Chất liệu sản phẩm được làm từ nhựa PP cao cấp, có khả năng chịu lực và chịu nhiệt tốt. Với chất liệu nhựa mà màu sắc chủ đạo là đem bóng, nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK sở hữu một vẻ ngoài sang trọng, hiện đại và trang nhã, phù hợp với mọi không gian bếp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-c%C3%B4ng-su%E1%BA%A5t-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.2. Công suất sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thông thường với các thiết bị sử dụng điện thì dung tích càng lớn, lượng điện năng tiêu thụ sẽ càng nhiều, gây tốn điện năng. Tuy nhiên, với sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK, công suất nồi chỉ 1800 W với dung tích hơn 5L, tiết kiệm điện năng hơn rất nhiều so với các thiết bị điện cùng loại như bếp nướng, bếp điện từ, nồi cơm điện, lò nướng,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQUqVkMv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uixzrgsxxtob7ltwtush.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQUqVkMv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uixzrgsxxtob7ltwtush.jpg" alt="Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock phiên bản EJF351BLK có đáng sử dụng?"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-thi%E1%BA%BFt-k%E1%BA%BF-l%C3%B2ng-n%E1%BB%93i"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.3. Thiết kế lòng nồi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lòng nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK được thiết kế vô cùng thông minh. Nó có khả năng tháo rời ra dễ dàng khỏi giỏ chiên chỉ bằng một cái chạm nhẹ ở phần tay cầm. Điều này giúp cho việc sắp xếp thực phẩm và việc vệ sinh nồi sau nấu dễ dàng hơn rất nhiều. Đây là ưu điểm vô cùng tiện lợi cho người sử dụng mà chiếc nồi này sở hữu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#14-c%C3%B4ng-ngh%E1%BB%87-chi%C3%AAn-ch%C3%A2n-kh%C3%B4ng-ti%C3%AAn-ti%E1%BA%BFn-h%C3%A0ng-%C4%91%E1%BA%A7u-hi%E1%BB%87n-nay"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.4. Công nghệ chiên chân không tiên tiến hàng đầu hiện nay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock phiên bản EJF351BLK sử dụng công nghệ chiên chân không kết hợp cùng công nghệ Rapid Air hiện đại, giúp nhiệt độ có thể nóng lên tới 360 độ, làm thực phẩm được chín đều, giữ được hương vị thơm ngon, nguyên vị mà không hề đọng lại dầu mỡ. Bên cạnh đó, luồng khí nóng bên trong nồi cùng với thiết kế quạt thổi sẽ giúp hơi nóng được tải đều và rộng hơn trong lòng nồi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Như vậy, với chiếc nồi chiên không dầu này, người dùng sẽ không còn phải lo về việc hấp thụ quá nhiều dầu mỡ như cách chiên rán thông thường. Đổi lại, bạn vẫn sẽ được thưởng thức những món ăn ngon mà không hề phải sử dụng chút dầu mỡ nào. Điều này cực kỳ có lợi cho sức khỏe của người sử dụng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#15-dung-t%C3%ADch-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.5. Dung tích sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dung tích của sản phẩm cũng là một trong những ưu thế mà chiếc nồi chiên EJF351BLK có được. Sản phẩm có dung tích lớn lên tới 5.2L. Điều này đồng nghĩa với việc người dùng có thể chế biến lượng lớn thức ăn, đủ phục vụ cho gia đình đông từ 6-8 người. Hoặc với những gia đình ít người nhưng thích ăn đồ chiên, nướng, đây cũng chính là chiếc nồi cực kỳ phù hợp và tiện dụng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q4f4X8f2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/talzjmt7bvsa77yqe3i3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q4f4X8f2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/talzjmt7bvsa77yqe3i3.jpg" alt="Nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK sở hữu nhiều tính năng nổi bật"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#16-t%C3%ADnh-n%C4%83ng-s%E1%BA%A3n-ph%E1%BA%A9m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;1.6. Tính năng sản phẩm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thay vì phải vệ sinh bằng các dung dịch chuyên dụng, nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK có thể dễ dàng tháo rời để rửa sạch bằng nước rửa chén thông thường. Ngoài ra, bạn cũng có thể cho phần lòng nồi vào máy rửa chén để rửa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sản phẩm còn được tích hợp nhiều chức năng ưu việt khác như: Có thể cài sẵn thời gian nấu lên tới 30 phút, có thể tự do điều khiển nhiệt độ cho phù hợp với từng giai đoạn của món ăn, nhiệt độ tối đa lên tới 200 độ C nên có thể dùng để nướng bánh, rau củ, tôm cua, thịt cá, hải sản,...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-%C6%B0u-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m-c%E1%BB%A7a-n%E1%BB%93i-chi%C3%AAn-kh%C3%B4ng-d%E1%BA%A7u-ejf351blk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Ưu nhược điểm của nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sau đây, hãy cùng chúng tôi phân tích những điểm nổi trội và còn cần cải thiện của sản phẩm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#21-v%E1%BB%81-%C6%B0u-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;2.1. Về ưu điểm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chiếc nồi sẽ giúp bạn tiết kiệm thời gian nấu nướng với chế độ cài sẵn giờ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hạn chế hấp thụ dầu mỡ, chất béo có hại cho sức khỏe mà vẫn được thưởng thức các món ăn chiên, nướng ngon, đảm bảo sức khỏe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hạn chế nguy cơ đồ ăn bị cháy khét, gây hại cho sức khỏe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiết kiệm dầu mỡ vì gần như không sử dụng đế&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Người dùng sẽ hoàn toàn thoát khỏi nỗi ám ảnh dọn dẹp bãi chiến trường sau khi nấu ăn. Việc vệ sinh vô cùng đơn giản vì khay nồi được lót một lớp chống dính, thiết kế khau và rá chiên rời nhau lại không bị bắn như khi dùng chảo hay lò nướng nên việc vệ sinh dễ dàng, nhanh chóng hơn rất nhiều&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dung tích nồi lớn có thể sử dụng cho các gia đình đông thành viên&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Công nghệ chiên thông minh giúp thực phẩm chín đều, tươi ngon, giữ được nguyên vị món ăn, không bị ám mùi khói&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nhiệt độ tối đa lên tới 200 độ và có thể cài thời gian nấu tự động trong 30 phút, giúp bạn chế biến đa dạng món ăn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acPsqK30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0e5jdt26aqoltbq4s8qj.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acPsqK30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0e5jdt26aqoltbq4s8qj.jpg" alt="Ưu điểm và nhược điểm của nồi chiên không dầu EJF351BLK"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#22-nh%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c-%C4%91i%E1%BB%83m"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;2.2. Nhược điểm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bên cạnh các ưu điểm kể trên, sản phẩm vẫn còn những nhược điểm như:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giá thành khá cao so với các loại nồi thường khác&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lớp chống dính sẽ khá mỏng nên khi lau chùi, vệ sinh cần cẩn thận để không làm xước&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sách hướng dẫn sử dụng hoàn toàn bằng tiếng anh nên đôi khi gây khó khăn cho người sử dụng&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trên đây là những ưu - nhược điểm của sản phẩm nồi chiên không dầu Lock&amp;amp;Lock EJF351BLK. Dù còn một số nhược điểm nhỏ nhưng sản phẩm quả thực rất đáng trải nghiệm cho những ai đang tìm một chiếc nồi chiên không dầu chất lượng cao. Còn chần chờ gì nữa, sở hữu ngay chiếc nồi tuyệt vời này thôi!&lt;/p&gt;

    DISCLAIMER: TO AVOID COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT I WILL NOT BE REVIEWING EVERY ASPECT OF THIS COURSE. IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS THE FULL COURSE GO TO: &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-cybersecurity-analyst"&gt;IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate&lt;/a&gt;. ENJOY!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools &amp;amp; Cyber Attacks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    In the first of a series of 7 courses within the IBM "Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certification," you will learn about the current challenges that are occurring within the cybersecurity field. As more and more valuable information and resources that have monetary worth become available, the more security threats and alerts will increase. With this increase in security threats, one would think, &lt;span&gt;"with so many bad guys creating security threats and attacks, there must be a ton of good guys to counter the bad guys, right?".&lt;/span&gt; Well, unfortunately, that is not the case, there is a lack of skilled security professionals in the cybersecurity field. There was a global study conducted by the  Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) and Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) which states that &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/11/prweb14899778"&gt;"the cybersecurity skills shortage is exacerbating the number of data breaches,”&lt;/a&gt; with the top two contributing factors to security incidents being &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/11/prweb14899778"&gt;“a lack of adequate training of non-technical employees”&lt;/a&gt; (31%) first and &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/11/prweb14899778"&gt;“a lack of adequate cybersecurity staff (22%)”&lt;/a&gt; second. As attacks become more complex, the knowledge that is required to deal with these attacks begins to increase whilst the time we have to deal with the attacks unfortunately decreases. The longer it takes for professionals to respond to attacks, the more it will cost to recover. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SOC Analyst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"What is a SOC Analyst and what do they do?"&lt;/p&gt; A Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537510/soc-analyst-job-description-salary-and-certification"&gt;"is a cybersecurity professional who works as part of a team to monitor and fight threats to an organization's IT infrastructure".&lt;/a&gt; A SOC Analyst will also &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537510/soc-analyst-job-description-salary-and-certification"&gt;"assess security systems and measures for weaknesses and possible improvements."&lt;/a&gt; It is up to the SOC Analyst to use tools for reviewing Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) and decide which events should recieve a high level of priority over others. You can check out the article &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537510/soc-analyst-job-description-salary-and-certification"&gt;"SOC analyst job description, salary, and certification"&lt;/a&gt; by Josh Fruhlinger to learn more about what a SOC Analyst does and how you can get a career by becoming a SOC Analyst.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ABX4rClK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6EKvi0xodeQ/X4bqwP20drI/AAAAAAAAAac/kEr8TjKNA0kPMc6-KTtbo0O6UbtHX9PXwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%252B%252528170%252529.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;What are We Talking about when We Talk about Cybersecurity?&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    In this section we will discuss the definition of cybersecurity, a few key terms and roles within security. Let's get started!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Information Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Now I know what you're thinking when it comes to defining the term "Information Security", and if you were thinking something along the lines of "securing information" then you are absolutely right! Information Security, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-12r1.pdf"&gt;"The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability."&lt;/a&gt; Within this definition are three importatant key words, "Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.". These three words together are known as the "CIA Triad", &lt;span&gt;"but what does confidentiality, integrity, and availability have to do with information security?"&lt;/span&gt; you might ask, well it actually has alot to do with information security, since the CIA triad is practically the building blocks to securing information. Let's get into more detail about what the CIA Traid really means!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CsJZV21WHtI/X4cY3_m2joI/AAAAAAAAAaw/atThz5mNkUoKjGShvxUKYz42eGGUuOSOwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B%2528171%2529.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UOicbyjV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CsJZV21WHtI/X4cY3_m2joI/AAAAAAAAAaw/atThz5mNkUoKjGShvxUKYz42eGGUuOSOwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%252B%252528171%252529.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  


&lt;h2&gt;The CIA Triad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    In the Information Security sub-section I mentioned the CIA Triad and what it is in minor detail, but lets discuss in further detail what the C.I.A in the triad really means.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
   Confidentiality &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The dictionary definition of "Confidentiality" is &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/confidentiality"&gt;"The ethical principle or legal right that a physician or other health professional will hold secret all information relating to a patient, unless the patient gives consent permitting disclosure."&lt;/a&gt; of course this is looking at it from a medical standpoint, but I'm sure you get the general idea 😊. Ok let's take Dictionary.com's definition and try to think of confidentiality from a technical standpoint, think about all the data a company has in their database, and we have security professionals taking measures to prevent said data from falling into the wrong hands. That is confidentiality.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
   Integrity&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    By definition Integrity is &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/integrity"&gt;"the state of being whole, entire, or undiminished"&lt;/a&gt;, so think of Integrity as the prevention of data being deleted or modified from an unauthorized source is essentially what Integrity stands for in the triad.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   Availability &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Available meaning to be &lt;a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/available"&gt;"suitable or ready for use; of use or service; at hand"&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to security, availability in essence means to have your data always ready to access when needed, by authorized users of course. A few best practices for maintaining availability would include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Continuity Plans&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Redundancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2Ix-f24hqtY/X4ddLh_oE9I/AAAAAAAAAbE/2tkeKy9U12MB-AR8BIv6-x03JfTZbpgBQCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2B%2528172%2529_LI.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This series is going to be dedicated to building and launching my first web app, which is a website focused around individuals creating and sharing math content. Join me and let us try to to make our way through this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-did-i-found-out-about-mathjax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How did I found out about MathJax?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I simply created a post on twitter asking, &lt;code&gt;Does anyone know any good JavaScript libraries for visualizing math equations?&lt;/code&gt;. Eventually, a geophysicist replied with one word, &lt;code&gt;MathJax&lt;/code&gt; and that is how I found it. So if you ever have a question, tweet about it into the endless void that is twitter and maybe the void might answer back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-mathjax"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is MathJax?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML and AsciiMat notation that works in all modern browsers. It was created with the goal to combine the power of modern web technologies with mathematics. MathJax requires no setup  on the part of the user(no plugins), so the page author can just write documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it properly. Basically, just add  MathJax to the project and it will handle displaying all the math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In MathJax mathematics is text based rather than image based, meaning that it can improve SEO because the equations are searchable just like normal text on websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MathJax includes the ability to generate speakable text versions of equations that can be used with screen readers. MathJax is highly configurable, allowing authors to customize it for the special requirements for any site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MathJax also has a rich API that can be used to make the mathematics on our webpages interactive and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now that we all know a little big more about MathJax I am working on creating a text editor in React that has the abilities of MathJax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>Entendendo o Node.js e seu funcionamento</title>
      <author>Leonardo de Sá</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/leonardodesa/entendendo-o-node-js-e-seu-funcionamento-1p9e</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introdução
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste artigo, você irá entender &lt;strong&gt;o que é o Node.JS&lt;/strong&gt;, e a sua principal funcionalidade que é indispensável para qualquer desenvolvedor compreender o funcionamento da linguagem, chamada de &lt;strong&gt;Event Loop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#o-que-%C3%A9-o-nodejs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  O que é o Node.js
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node.js, ou simplesmente Node, é um software de código aberto baseado no interpretador V8 do Google e que &lt;strong&gt;permite a execução do código javascript do lado do servidor&lt;/strong&gt; de forma simples, rápida e performática.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interpretador-do-node"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interpretador do Node
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Interpretador é um &lt;strong&gt;software especializado que interpreta e executa javascript&lt;/strong&gt;. O Node utiliza o Interpretador V8, que tem como proposta acelerar o desempenho de uma aplicação compilando o código Javascript para o formato que a máquina irá entender antes de executá-lo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#call-stack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Call Stack
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;É uma pilha de eventos&lt;/strong&gt;, esses eventos podem ser uma função disparada pelo código. Por isso o event-loop fica monitorando para que, toda vez que uma função for disparada, ele deverá executá-la somente uma coisa por vez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vamos ver um exemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ITYHks0k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nxiywwa5zgbghfpkxt2k.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ITYHks0k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nxiywwa5zgbghfpkxt2k.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqui temos um exemplo bem simples para entendermos como funciona a stack. Basicamente a função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateCarDescription&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; é chamada recebendo o nome do carro e sua versão, e retorna uma sentença com os parâmetros concatenados. A função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateCarDescription&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; depende da função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateNameAndVersion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, que é responsável por unir as informações de nome e versão.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hl0O-DkC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/me7byfq1flt535vpm4c3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hl0O-DkC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/me7byfq1flt535vpm4c3.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quando a função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateCarDescription&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; é invocada, ela depende da função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateNameAndVersion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; para atribuir o valor do nome e versão do carro na variável &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;nameAndVersion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e, quando ela for chamada, ela será adicionada na stack como no exemplo abaixo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cG_pbT3d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gfsaq36vgr15mijwmxju.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cG_pbT3d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gfsaq36vgr15mijwmxju.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Após a execução da funcão &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateCarDescription&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, logo em seguida a variável &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;nameAndVersion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; irá receber o retorno da função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;generateNameAndVersion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; que foi imediatamente adicionada na stack, até que sua execução finalize e o retorno seja feito. Após o retorno, a stack ficará assim:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j8IaxCKr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k43bpfytx9egpq80htrs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j8IaxCKr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k43bpfytx9egpq80htrs.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A última etapa será retornar a variável &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;nameAndVersion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, que contém o nome e versão do veículo. Isso não irá alterar em nada na stack. Quando a função &lt;code&gt;generateCarDescription&lt;/code&gt; terminar, as demais linhas serão executadas. No nosso exemplo será o &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; imprimindo a variável &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;infoCar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. E por fim, será adicionado o &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; quando tudo acima já estiver sido executado.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DMno1ixy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bv2bw8bozdxyt0xvrqok.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DMno1ixy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bv2bw8bozdxyt0xvrqok.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como a &lt;strong&gt;stack só executa uma função por vez&lt;/strong&gt;, de acordo com o tamanho da função e o que será processado, isso irá ocupar mais tempo na stack, fazendo com que as próximas chamadas esperem mais tempo para serem executadas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#io-opera%C3%A7%C3%A3o-bloqueante-e-n%C3%A3o-bloqueante"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I/O - Operação bloqueante e não bloqueante
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I/O se refere, principalmente, à interação com o disco do sistema e a integração com a &lt;a href="https://libuv.org/"&gt;libuv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Operação bloqueante é a execução do código no processo do Node precisa esperar&lt;/strong&gt; até que uma operação seja concluída. Isso acontece porque o event loop é incapaz de continuar executando alguma tarefa, enquanto uma operação bloqueante está sendo executada.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Todos os métodos I/O na biblioteca padrão do Node tem uma versão assíncrona, que, por definição, são não-bloqueantes&lt;/strong&gt;, e aceitam funções de callback. Alguns métodos também têm suas versões bloqueantes, que possuem o sufixo &lt;strong&gt;Sync&lt;/strong&gt; no nome. Para maiores Informações sobre I/O, acesse: &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/"&gt;I/O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#singlethread"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Single-Thread
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O Node é uma plataforma orientada a eventos, que utiliza o conceito de thread única para gerenciar a stack. Quem é &lt;strong&gt;single thread é o v8 do Google&lt;/strong&gt;, responsável por rodar o código do Node, a stack faz parte do v8, ou seja, ela é single thread, que executa uma função de cada vez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#multithreading"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Multi-Threading
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para trabalhar com operações paralelas, e obter um ganho de desempenho, o Node e sua stack por si só são incapazes de resolver múltiplas operações ao mesmo tempo, por isso, ele conta com uma lib chamada de &lt;a href="https://libuv.org/"&gt;libuv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;que é capaz de gerenciar processos em background de I/O assíncrono não bloqueantes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exemplo de uma função assíncrona sendo executada:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vvKkJD2v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lied917dt47n8cvnqdka.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vvKkJD2v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lied917dt47n8cvnqdka.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nesse exemplo, a função &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; é executada na stack e jogada para uma thread, enquanto ela vai sendo processada e administrada pela libuv. A stack continua executando as próximas funções e, quando terminar o processamento, a função de callback será adicionada na Task Queue para ser processada quando a stack estiver vazia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--udM7w96b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qfox2rznpsmkp7xp6bpe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--udM7w96b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qfox2rznpsmkp7xp6bpe.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#task-queue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Task queue
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Algumas funções são enviadas para serem executadas em outra thread, permitindo que a stack siga para as próximas funções e não bloqueie nossa aplicação.&lt;br&gt;
Essas funções que são enviadas para outra thread precisam ter um callback, que é uma função que será executada quando a função principal for finalizada.&lt;br&gt;
Os callbacks aguardam a sua vez para serem executados na stack. Enquanto esperam, eles ficam em um lugar chamado de task queue. &lt;strong&gt;Sempre que a thread principal finalizar uma tarefa, o que significa que a stack estará vazia, uma nova tarefa é movida da task queue para a stack, onde será executada&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqui temos um exemplo para facilitar:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k7VQefl4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p1f2dflk1st5fywlrnz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k7VQefl4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p1f2dflk1st5fywlrnz.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Event Loop é responsável por buscar essas tarefas de background, e executá-las na stack&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#micro-e-macro-tasks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Micro e macro tasks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Event Loop é formado por macro tasks e micro tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. As macro tasks que serão enfileiradas no background, e que quando forem processadas, terão um callback dentro da task queue que será chamado quando a stack estiver vazia. dentro de cada ciclo, o &lt;strong&gt;event loop irá executar primeiramente as micro tasks&lt;/strong&gt; disponíveis. As micro tasks vão sendo processadas, até que a fila de microtask esteja esgotada, assim que todas as chamadas de micro tasks forem feitas, então no próximo ciclo, o callback da macro task que está na task queue será executado. Ou seja, &lt;strong&gt;dentro de um mesmo ciclo, as micro tasks, serão executadas antes das macro tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#macro-tasks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Macro tasks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vou citar alguns exemplos de funções que se comportam como &lt;strong&gt;macro tasks&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;I/O&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;setInterval&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#micro-tasks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Micro tasks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alguns exemplos conhecidos de &lt;strong&gt;micro tasks&lt;/strong&gt; são as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;promises&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e o &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;process.nextTick&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. As micro tasks normalmente são tarefas que devem ser executadas rapidamente após alguma ação, ou realizar algo assíncrono sem a necessidade de inserir uma nova task na task queue.&lt;br&gt;
Vamos tentar entender melhor com alguns exemplos, coloquei algumas anotações para facilitar o entendimento:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7VO9hKTm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uemly3cddxmt7hc4rfnf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7VO9hKTm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uemly3cddxmt7hc4rfnf.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ao executar o código acima, teremos o seguinte resultado de priorização:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NFMMULcs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1w2ul7vpuds9cf6aws2d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NFMMULcs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1w2ul7vpuds9cf6aws2d.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você deve estar se perguntando o porquê não está sendo executado em ordem, vou tentar explicar com as anotações que fiz no código.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[A]&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Executado diretamente na stack&lt;/strong&gt;, dessa forma ele é síncrono, então o restante do código irá aguardar o resultado para ser executado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[B]&lt;/strong&gt;: Enfileirado como uma tarefa futura, &lt;strong&gt;prioridade macro task&lt;/strong&gt;, será executado apenas no próximo loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[C]&lt;/strong&gt;: Enfileirado como uma tarefa futura, &lt;strong&gt;prioridade micro task&lt;/strong&gt;, será executado imediatamente após todas as tarefas/tasks do loop atual e antes do próximo loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[D]&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Executado diretamente na stack&lt;/strong&gt;, dessa forma ele é síncrono, então o restante do código irá aguardar o resultado para ser executado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclus%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusão
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nesse artigo vimos o que é o Node e como ele funciona “por baixo dos panos”&lt;/strong&gt;, espero que vocês tenham entendido com clareza e que essa visão ajude vocês a escreverem códigos melhores e de uma maneira que tire maior proveito desse funcionamento. Aconselho também a leitura complementar dos links de referências que irão facilitar o entendimento.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/jasonleowsg/answer-to-what-programming-language-should-i-learn-2gph</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning coding isn't just about learning the syntax of whatever programming language that you chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also all these learnings at the edges of coding that no online MOOC will cover. Things that you only learn not from the act of coding itself. Things like how to think through and decide on technologies to use as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my newbie experience dabbling with different frameworks and programming languages, I learned my current best answer to that age old question that everyone starting to learn programming will invariably ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What programming language/framework should I learn?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s my answer, for all us newbies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose something mature, to start with.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be HTML, CSS, Javascript. It can be mature languages like PHP, Python or Ruby. Yes, React/Vue/Svelte are new, exciting and hot right now, but start where millions had trodden through. This way, you start on the shoulders of giants who had gone before you. Thousands of tutorials, guides, docs, blog posts, answers on Stack Overflow - all there to help you as a noob. The only skill to learn as a noob is knowing how to search well. Being a mature and established programming language, there’s definitely someone who had faced the bug you’re trying to squash. As a noob it’s highly unlikely to face some edge case that no one had encountered. Hence, that significantly lowers the barrier to entry, rather than trying to figure out a solution on your own. Why else do people always say, start with the fundamentals, with fundamentals being HTML, CSS and Javascript?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose something that your friends are using&lt;/strong&gt;, friends whom you know will help you, friends who are making the kind of products that you want to make. There’s nothing wrong in trying to emulate them a bit when starting off. That’s how we learn as babies and it continues to be a common way to learn professionally (just ask any artist or designer). I got lots of inspiration from some folks in the maker community, and seeing the products they make that I want to make myself, made me motivated to learn what tech they use. That’s why I first started with HTML, CSS and PHP basics (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio"&gt;@levelsio&lt;/a&gt;’s no framework, no bs approach), then got into Ruby on Rails (ala the entrepreneurial steadfastness of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook"&gt;@yongfook&lt;/a&gt;), then Vue and Nuxt (influenced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dannypostmaa"&gt;@dannypostmaa&lt;/a&gt;’s shipping pace and quality). I got inspired by these guys and then slowly made friends whom you can lean on for help. Going with these tech help sustain me on my journey, continue to stay inspired, and persevere through challenging coding times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose something that doesn’t promise (just) to get you there fast&lt;/strong&gt;, but something that will get you there and beyond. As with Strapi, I was lured by the ‘fast’ bait, but with it came a lot of other trade-offs downstream which I only realised much later, after much sunk costs. But how do you know if you’re a noob? Yep you don’t. So you pay for lessons like this with your time. But once bitten, twice shy. At least now I know, next time someone/something comes along that hard-sells you the bs that it’s “Fast! Easy! Cheap!”, be very careful. Caveat here is that if you don’t mind changing course, you can of course start with what’s fast first, then switch out for something else later that suits your use case. I often feel that way with nocode too - it gets a MVP to market fast, yes, but invariably I will hit some wall later, which makes me wonder if I should have started with something more stable instead. Do I really want to have to rewrite everything, everytime? There’s a beauty to being able to use one tool (language/framework) all the way, progressively. And fast is often a function of competency, not necessarily language/framework. Once you stick to it and get good enough, you can ship fast even if you don’t use frameworks or libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best answer at the moment to that famous noob question “What programming language should I learn?” I’ll probably cringe when I reread this years later. I would expect to cringe, because that would mean I had grown since. And this post would have served its purpose then.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Follow my daily writings on &lt;a href="https://golifelog.com/goals/30"&gt;Lifelog&lt;/a&gt;, where I write about learning to code, goals, productivity, indie hacking and tech for good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Python tutorial: Get started with Python arrays</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/educative/python-tutorial-get-started-with-python-arrays-4ob6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s used in many different fields like web development, data science, machine learning, and more. Arrays are an important data structure in Python. Arrays allow us to store multiple values at a time and perform actions on those values. In this Python tutorial, we’ll explore Python arrays, array operations, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ll cover&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#array"&gt;What are Python arrays?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#create"&gt;Create Python array&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#operations"&gt;Common array operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#2d"&gt;2D Python arrays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#nextsteps"&gt;Wrapping up and next steps&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-python-arrays"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Python arrays?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Python array is a container that can hold a number of elements of the same data type in one single variable. This allows us to store multiple elements of the same type together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrays are very common. Most data structures use arrays to execute algorithms, and arrays are very commonly used in fields like data science and machine learning. We can use arrays when we want to manipulate data of a certain type. They’re very useful when working with large amounts of data because arrays can hold a large number of elements. An array &lt;strong&gt;element&lt;/strong&gt; is an item stored in an array. So the items “Spot”, “Max”, and “Sam” from our &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; array are elements. The &lt;strong&gt;index&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the numerical index location of each element. We can use the index to identify and access elements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-python-lists"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Python lists?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the two are sometimes confused, a Python list is different than a Python array. A list is a collection of items that contains data of different data types. This means that the first element of the list can be a string, the second element can be an integer, and the third can be a list of strings, etc. Lists are ordered, mutable, and their elements don’t need to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can convert our Python lists to arrays using the NumPy Python library using one of the following NumPy array functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;numpy.array()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;numpy.asarray()&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-python-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Create Python array
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create a new array using the array module and the &lt;code&gt;import array&lt;/code&gt; command. Let’s take a look at an example Python program:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

print(dogs)

=&amp;gt; ['Spot', 'Max', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Cooper', 'Duke', 'Bear', 'Buddy', 'Milo', 'Murphy']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s take a look at the different operations we can perform on Python arrays.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#common-array-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Common array operations
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add elements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of different ways to add elements to an array. We can append elements to the end of the array using the &lt;code&gt;append()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

dogs.append("Wrigley")

print(dogs)

=&amp;gt; ['Spot', 'Max', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Cooper', 'Duke', 'Bear', 'Buddy', 'Milo', 'Murphy', 'Wrigley']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;insert()&lt;/code&gt; method to add an element to a given index location within our array. Here’s an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

dogs.insert(1, "Wrigley")

print(dogs)

=&amp;gt; ['Spot', 'Wrigley', 'Max', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Cooper', 'Duke', 'Bear', 'Buddy', 'Milo', 'Murphy']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#access-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Access elements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can access an array item by referring to its index number. For example, if we want to get the value of the first array item, we can use the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

x = dogs[0]

print(x)

=&amp;gt; Spot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we want to access a specific element and change that element, we access the index number and set it equal to the modified value. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

dogs[0] = "Jack"

print(dogs)

=&amp;gt; ['Jack', 'Max', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Cooper', 'Duke', 'Bear', 'Buddy', 'Milo', 'Murphy']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remove-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remove elements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of different ways to remove elements of an array. We can use the &lt;code&gt;pop()&lt;/code&gt; Python function to remove an element at a specified position. Let’s say we want to remove the last element of our &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

dogs.pop(9)

print(dogs)

=&amp;gt; ['Spot', 'Max', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Cooper', 'Duke', 'Bear', 'Buddy', 'Milo']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt; method to remove a specified element from an array. Here’s an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

dogs.remove("Duke")

print(dogs)

=&amp;gt; ['Spot', 'Max', 'Sam', 'Charlie', 'Cooper', 'Bear', 'Buddy', 'Milo', 'Murphy']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#find-array-length"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Find array length
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; method to return the length of an array. If we want to return the number of elements in the &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; array, we can use the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

x = len(dogs)

print(x)

=&amp;gt; 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sort-python-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sort Python array
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;sort()&lt;/code&gt; method to sort our array in ascending or descending order. If we want to sort our array in ascending order, we can use the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbers = [5, 13, 25, 2, 98, 56, 4, 8]

numbers.sort()

print(numbers)

=&amp;gt; [2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 25, 56, 98]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To sort our array in descending order, we can use the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbers = [5, 13, 25, 2, 98, 56, 4, 8]

numbers.sort(reverse=True)

print(numbers)

=&amp;gt; [98, 56, 25, 13, 8, 5, 4, 2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#count-elements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Count elements
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;count()&lt;/code&gt; method to return the number of elements with the specified value. For example, let’s say we want to return the number of times the value “Spot” appears in our &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dogs = ["Spot", "Max", "Sam", "Charlie", "Cooper", "Duke", "Bear", "Buddy", "Milo", "Murphy"]

x = dogs.count("Spot")

print(x)

=&amp;gt; 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2d-python-arrays"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2D Python arrays
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2D array, or a two-dimensional array, is when there’s an array within an array. In a standard array, each element has an index. In a 2D array, each element has two indices. Let’s move on to an example. Imagine we need to keep track of how the temperature changes throughout the day. We’ll take four temperatures: one in the early morning, one in the late morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening. We can store these temperatures in a 2D array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Day one&lt;/strong&gt;: 52, 60, 66, 63&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Day two&lt;/strong&gt;: 50, 58, 62, 60&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Day three&lt;/strong&gt;: 53, 61, 67, 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Day four&lt;/strong&gt;: 51, 59, 65, 62
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;temperatures = [[52, 60, 66, 63], [50, 58, 62, 60], [53, 61, 67,64], [51, 59, 65, 62]]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can perform the same actions on 2D arrays as we can on standard arrays. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up-and-next-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping up and next steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats on taking your first steps with Python arrays! Arrays are an important and common data structure. They have a wide range of uses and are commonly used to execute algorithms. There’s still a lot more to learn about the Python programming language. Some recommended concepts to cover next include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python dictionaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python tuples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
