      <title>Adventures in Scale: Google is Tech’s Lewis and Clark </title>
      <author>Conor Bronsdon</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 16:33:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/linearb/adventures-in-scale-google-is-tech-s-lewis-and-clark-3k3k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/linearb/adventures-in-scale-google-is-tech-s-lewis-and-clark-3k3k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To call Google a titan of the tech industry would be an understatement. Their name has become synonymous with the internet itself. The very act of retrieving information from the internet — the core functionality of the internet and its most basic purpose — is known simply as “Googling” something. On their road to becoming the web’s biggest search engine and a moniker for the internet itself, Google also pioneered much of what it takes to grow a company at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Dev Interrupted Podcast Google Senior Engineer’s Hyrum Wright and Titus Winters, shared their lessons learned from programming at Google with LinearB Co-Founder and COO, Dan Lines. Both engineers have a deep understanding of the principles behind software development: Hyrum is semi-famous as the “Hyrum” of Hyrum’s Law; while Titus is responsible for 250 million lines of code that over 12,000 developers work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what lessons can we take from their interview — and their book &lt;a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? How can we apply those lessons to our own projects? I’ve pulled out the core takeaways from their interview and condensed them so that any developer or company, be they responsible for 2,000 lines of code or 2,000,000, can learn something from Google’s roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-listen-to-google"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why listen to Google
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of their enormous success and scale, Google doesn’t pretend to have all the answers; this lack of presumption is exactly the thinking that has made them the titan they are. Previous success is no guarantee of future success and no one understands this better than Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One thing that Google is very good at is not accepting how everyone else does it as the one true way.”&lt;/em&gt; — Titus Winters, on the Dev Interrupted podcast at 20:35&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="100%" height="232px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/2r5ZD46J8mueaopwBlYJs6"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to assume that events and conclusions are foregone, or that one event naturally follows another. Yet this is rarely the case. Most of the time people are working towards a specific outcome, and it’s not until later that the outcome is apparent contextually. This is true in life and software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has spent the past couple decades approaching everything they do as trial and error, learning what does and does not work, and trying to institutionalize the things that do work. This is not a straight path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mindset is obvious in Hyrum and Titus’ interview. Titus uses the analogy of Lewis and Clark to explain how the software development process at Google has unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They say Lewis and Clark explored the Louisiana Purchase, by which we mean, they took one path out and one path back, which is not exactly mapping, but in a similar way, we’re trying to give an exploration/trip-report/map.”&lt;/em&gt; — Titus Winters, on the Dev Interrupted podcast at 6:17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s admitting that Google doesn’t have all of the answers; that Google’s path isn’t the *only *path to success; that other paths may be superior to Google’s; and that their path may not work for every business. But, with decades of experience, Google has learned a thing or two along the way, and maybe, just maybe, we can all learn something from the path they have trailblazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, there aren’t many companies in the world that have hundreds of millions of lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-3-pillars-of-software-engineering-at-google"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The 3 Pillars of Software Engineering at Google
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZDx8-_dI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0%2AQb2YQYHDe3MFNtTR.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZDx8-_dI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0%2AQb2YQYHDe3MFNtTR.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Anyone can change a line of code or change 10 lines of code. But how about changing 10,000 lines of code or 100,000 lines of code in a reasonable time?&lt;/em&gt; — Hyrum Wright, on the Dev Interrupted Podcast at 17:15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much code to manage, Google has made maintaining their code a strategic goal. Code must be fresh and able to sustain changes to the code base for business or technical reasons. To best allow for this, they have identified 3 concepts that they believe are core to software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the hardest stuff that software engineers are going to have to deal with like skew version, backwards compatibility, issues with data storage, dependency management, upgrades and many more, are all problems created by time. Once dev teams realize this, it will change their perspective on how best to write code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you are going to get rid of your code within one or two years, then you probably don’t need to worry too much about making changes or upgrades to it in the future. But if you are going to write code that will remain in use after five or ten years, then you may want to approach it differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If dev teams want their code base to last, they need to think about constructing code so that it can sustain changes within an organization’s lifespan. This fundamental realization allows time to peacefully coexist with the second pillar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-scale"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Scale
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How your system scales is a relationship with time. Scaling isn’t a new problem and Google has been at the forefront of pushing scale their entire existence. For instance, email existed before Gmail and search engines existed before Google, but Google’s brilliance was their ability to scale these technologies better than their competitors. It’s the root of their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To beat their competitors they adopted a mindset of scaling as a process — a continual evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a company grows, all of its operations expand and that continued expansion requires more resources, which begets even more resources still. This means growth cannot occur superlinearly because if it does, eventually a company will consume all of its resources maintaining the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway is to make sure your codebase and software both scale &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sublinear&amp;amp;source=lmns&amp;amp;rlz=1C1JZAP_enUS848US852&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj20Nra367yAhXefzABHSKWBGMQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA"&gt;sublinearly &lt;/a&gt;, that way if your codebase doubles or triples you won’t need six times as many engineers just to maintain your systems. (Sublinear scaling refers to team growth that occurs more slowly than the number of supported services of a company. Superlinear growth is the opposite — with team growth outpacing the number of supported services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-tradeoffs-and-costs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Trade-offs and Costs
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking into consideration the best practices around time and scale, what is left is good decision making. Just as Hyrum and Titus note in their book, &lt;a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe_at_google.2.pdf"&gt;“in software engineering, as in life, good choices lead to good outcomes.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no organization has perfect data on which to base every decision, and therefore must strive to make the best decisions they can with the most data possible. People need insights into what an organization finds impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if an engineer spends a week on a project, it should probably be a project the organization considers a priority. Because if it is not, then no matter how perfect the code, it probably wasn’t the best use of the engineer’s time. Brain power should be devoted to the most difficult problems, not where a semicolon should be placed. The cost of incorrectly evaluating trade-offs is failing the 1st two pillars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#coming-home"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coming Home
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Hyrum and Titus may not be Lewis and Clark reborn, they have a valuable story to tell about trial and error in the Information Age. How a company scales is likely to define how it differentiates itself from its competitors and whether or not it will be successful. A company that can scale sublinearly will thrive, all others will stagnate as victims of their own success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minding the principles of these modern-day explorations into the wilderness of code will help any organization keep an eye on the most valuable resource: time. But remember just as Lewis and Clark found one path forward, they didn’t find the *only *path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can all learn something from Google, but never forget the path forward is your own.&lt;/p&gt;

  Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know what is used in emails, messages and video chats for privacy? Do you know what is used as the underlying structure of the blockchain which is powering cryptocurrency? It is Cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cipher is an algorithm that can encode plaintext into unreadable text, and to decode the unreadable text back into readable text. For a specific text, you will have to use the same cipher for encoding and decoding of the text. They are used for safe information transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#uses-1"&gt;Uses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#rsa"&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#advantages-1"&gt;Advantages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#history"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  History
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciphers were used long before the information age, like the substitution cipher, whose decoding was done by substituting letters following a certain pattern. The pattern was chosen by the encoder. Transposition cipher was also used before the information age, to decode a string encoded with transposition cipher, one had to shift the positions of letters. None of the old ciphers were cryptographically secure except for the one-time pad(now called One Time Password) cipher. It is a single-use pre-shared key used to decode the messages, it is nowadays used in authentication(see &lt;a href="https://github.com/hamiecod/MDN-Notes/tree/main/Glossary/CRA/CRA.md"&gt;CRA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#types-of-cryptography"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Types of Cryptography
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cryptography - symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#symmetric-key-cryptography"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Symmetric Key cryptography
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same encryption keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of corresponding ciphertext. Symmetric-key algorithms use stream ciphers or block ciphers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#uses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Uses
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in HTTPS protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payment/Banking Applications to authenticate transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used in data centres and servers to encrypt the data which is at rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster than asymmetric-key cryptography because there is only one key in play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better performance because of less calculations being performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As they are quicker, they are optimized for handling large amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to set-up and implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#block-ciphers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Block Ciphers
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are encryption algorithms that take an input message and a key to generate a new encrypted cipher text, and then it uses the cipher text and the same key to decrypt the message. It encrypts blocks of data of fixed size at a time. The size of the block depends on the size of the key. The data to be encrypted is divided into blocks of equal size.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The encryption and the decryption algorithm accept two inputs - an input of size n bits and a key of size k bits; and returns a n-bit output. The decryption algorithm is the inverse function to encryption: decryption = encryption^(-1). Block cipher encryptions are just permuntations of the plain text by the key. Eac key selects one permutation from the set of 2^k permutations. There are infinite number of permutations/keys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We do not encrypt the data using 100s of keys because that is very expensive and time-consuming. Block Ciphers are very safe for secure data transfers, they are also used in cryptographic protocols. Popular block ciphers are AES, DES and 3DES. Block ciphers are slower but they are more secure and are the industry standard. The process of encryption using block ciphers is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;each block --&amp;gt; corresponding encryption key --&amp;gt; corresponding encryption block --&amp;gt; combined binary text --&amp;gt; decimal or hexadecimal cipher
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stream-cipher"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stream Cipher
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stream cipher is a type of cipher that encrypts one bit at a time. It is a quicker format of encryption considering that it does not have to encrypt large blocks at a time. In stream ciphers, data is converted to binary digits and encrypted sequentially, each binary digit is encrypted one after other. Popular stream cipher algorithms include RC4 and Salsa20. The process of encrypting data using stream cipher is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;plain text --&amp;gt; binary data --&amp;gt; algorithmic function(f(x)) using random encryption key --&amp;gt; decimal or hexadecimal data(ciphertext)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asymmetric-key-cryptography"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Asymmetric Key Cryptography
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use different keys for encryption and decryption of data. It follows the concept of public keys(known to everyone) and private keys(known to nobody except the owner). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using this type of cryptography, the sender first encrypts the original text using a public key, and then sends the encrypted text to the receiver. The receiver decrypts the cipher using his private key. The public key can be shared with anyone who wants to send you a message, whereas the private key should not be shared with anybody. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In asymmetric-key cryptography, unlike symmetric-key cryptography, the sender does not need to send the key to the receiver. Asymmetric-key cryptography resolves the risk of key sharing in a dangerous network in which the third party can intercept the key. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is impossible to create duplicate keys as the private and public keys are mathematically connected.&lt;br&gt;
Popular assymetric-key cryptography algorithms include RSA and DSA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#uses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Uses
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in SSH protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in mailing protocols like iMap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in blockchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used in digital signatures to maintain the authenticity of documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used for sharing keys for symmetric key cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rsa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  RSA
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the most widely used Assymetric algorithm. It is named after its founders - Ron &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ivest, Adi &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;hamir and Leonard &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;dleman. It uses block ciphers to obsure the data. It is used on the web by VPNs, emails and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Example
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emails use Assymetric-key cryptography, our email address is the public key, which is available publicly to everybody, whereas the credentials to log into our email are private, using which only the owner of the mail can read the mails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advantages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advantages
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need of any reliable key sharing channel, it was a risk in symmetric key cryptography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer keys which increase the security, like &lt;u&gt;2048 bit&lt;/u&gt; keys and &lt;u&gt;4096 bit&lt;/u&gt; keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used for proof of authenticity of the owner as he only possesses the private key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a third party modifies the ciphertext generated by the public key, the private key would not be able to decrypt the text and even if it does, it would be easy to identify the discrepancy.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>What is up with var, let and const? What the hell is the difference between these three?</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/shubhracodes/what-is-up-with-var-let-and-const-what-the-hell-is-the-difference-between-these-three-5dk1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With ES2016 came two new methods to declare variable i.e. &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;. Before that the developers had access to only &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;(I feel bad for them, no kidding). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what's the catch here? Why are there three different ways to declare variables? Wasn't JavaScript already confusing enough and now they're making it more confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can understand how &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let/const&lt;/code&gt; differ we need to understand a computer science-y concept called &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#function-scope-vs-block-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Function scope vs Block Scope
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript comes with two kinds of scope i.e Function scope and block scope. Let's have a look at the difference in both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#function-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Function Scope
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function myFn() {
  var foo = 'peekaboo!';

  console.log(foo); // 'peekaboo!'
}

console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: foo is not defined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Variables are function-scoped when using var because their visibility is restricted to the function. You'll get an error if you try to utilise it outside of the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#block-scope"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Block Scope
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (true) {
  var foo = 'peekaboo!';
  let bar = 'i see u';
  const baz = 'baby blue!';

  console.log(foo); // 'peekaboo!';
  console.log(bar); // 'i see u';
  console.log(baz); // 'baby blue!';
}

console.log(foo); // 'peekaboo!';
console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice the visibility of foo isn’t limited by the if-statement block. However, both &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;baz&lt;/code&gt; are limited in visibility to the block of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of scope is the most prominent distinction between the old-fashioned &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and modern &lt;code&gt;let/const&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hGro-vYt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pbhe41h74iecbev8p1r6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hGro-vYt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pbhe41h74iecbev8p1r6.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mpjme"&gt;https://twitter.com/mpjme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#var"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  VAR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at the following code snippet&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

console.log(i);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to you what will be the output of the following program??&lt;br&gt;
If you said&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//0
//1
//2
//3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;then you're absolutely correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is accessible outside of the for-loop. This is expected since variables defined with var have a function scope rather than a block scope i.e they're accessible within the whole function in which they are defined in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it's so cool then what's the problem with using var? Why aren't we using it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll use the example below to explain:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    var greeter = "hey hi";
    var times = 4;

    if (times &amp;gt; 3) {
        var greeter = "say Hello instead"; 
    }

    console.log(greeter) // "say Hello instead"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, since &lt;code&gt;times &amp;gt; 3&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, greeter is redefined  to "say Hello instead". While this is not a problem if you knowingly want greeter to be redefined, it becomes a problem when you do not realise that a variable greeter has already been defined before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have used greeter in other parts of your code, you might be surprised at the output you might get. This will likely cause a lot of bugs in your code. This is why let and const are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In layman terms, &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; can be redefined and it's values can also be changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Shubhra, what can we do to save ourselves from making such blunder in production code???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, worry not, the people in the JavaScript headquaters knew that you would be having this problem and already gave a solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  LET
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is like a cousin of &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;. It has a lot of similarities but differentiates in ways that makes ES2016 a more modern-feeling language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take the same example we took in &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

console.log(i);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time what do you think the output is going to be?? Well if you said&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;//0
//1
//2
//ReferenceError: i is not defined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;then you're in luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Shubhra, if &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is a cousin of &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; then why is it coming undefined? &lt;br&gt;
Let me tell you, so &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is blocked scope instead of being function scoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-can-be-updated-but-not-redeclared"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  let can be updated but not re-declared.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;,  a variable declared with &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; can be updated within its scope. Unlike &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    let greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;this will return an error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    let greeting = "say Hi";
    let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if the same variable is defined in different scopes, there will be no error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    let greeting = "say Hi";
    if (true) {
        let greeting = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead"
    }
    console.log(greeting); // "say Hi"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why is there no error? This is because both instances are treated as different variables since they have different scopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact makes &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; a better choice than &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;. When using &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;, you don't have to bother if you have used a name for a variable before as a variable exists only within its scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, since a variable cannot be declared more than once within a scope, then the problem discussed earlier that occurs with &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; does not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#const"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  CONST
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keyword &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation for constant. Similar to &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;, it’s block-scoped, however, you can’t reassign it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think is the output of this code?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const myBoolean = true;

if (myBoolean) {
  const turtles = [
    'leonardo',
    'donatello',
    'michaelangelo',
    'raphael'
  ];
  // turtles = turtles.concat('Shredder');  // 🙅‍♀️ this would throw an error

  console.log(turtles);
}

console.log(turtles);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The output&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// ['leonardo', 'donatello', 'michaelangelo', 'raphael']
// ReferenceError: turtles is not defined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; is not transferred in this scenario, items can still be added to a const variable that links to an array or an object.&lt;br&gt;
This is a topic for another blog. I will discuss it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because function-scope isn't as evident as block-scope, it's best to avoid using &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;. The objective of ES2016-2019 appears to be to replace &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;let/const&lt;/code&gt; because they encourage better code habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to construct a variable, you should usually use const. Use let instead if you know or suspect you'll need to reassign it (for-loops, switch statements, algorithm swapping).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started with Drayman</title>
      <author>Yan Ivan Evdokimov</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:54:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jansivans/getting-started-with-drayman-1ng7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jansivans/getting-started-with-drayman-1ng7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drayman.io"&gt;Drayman&lt;/a&gt; is a server-side component framework which allows you to use any available HTML element, web component or custom Drayman third-party component together with server-side code in single script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Drayman, browser only renders what user should see - all logic and calculations happen server-side and UI is written using JSX syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best way to show Drayman capabilities is to create something with it. So let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#file-viewer-component"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  File viewer component
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's build a component which allows user to select a file from file system and view it's contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install a Drayman. It can be done by running these commands:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx @drayman/framework-init@latest my-app
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;my-app
npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Website will be available at &lt;a href="http://localhost:3033"&gt;http://localhost:3033&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't want install anything, you can always try Drayman inside a CodeSandbox by visiting &lt;a href="http://new.drayman.io"&gt;new.drayman.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-component-template"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial component template
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;src/components/home.tsx&lt;/code&gt; and replace it's contents with this code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DraymanComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Select a file to view it directly from file system&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You will see an initial skeleton of our component. Further &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;select&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will be used to show available files and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will show contents of the selected file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#filling-select-with-options"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Filling select with options
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Drayman runs a component server-side, we can use any Node.js library. In our case we will use &lt;code&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's read file names from project root directory and fill &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;select&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; options with them:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DraymanComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Select a file to view it directly from file system&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now our component is only showing some elements without any interactivity. Our next step will be to add it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reacting-to-user-actions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reacting to user actions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to remember which file user has selected to show it's contents. It can be done by using &lt;code&gt;onchange&lt;/code&gt; event attribute and attaching a function which will be &lt;a href="http://www.drayman.io/docs/components-in-depth/handling-events"&gt;executed server-side&lt;/a&gt;. We also need to add &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute to each &lt;code&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; so &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; would know which option was selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's also add &lt;code&gt;fs.readFile&lt;/code&gt; function inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag so Drayman would read file contents during re-render. We won't show &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; until file is actually selected:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DraymanComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Select a file to view it directly from file system&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;utf-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you make a selection from dropdown, you will see that nothing happens on page - file contents doesn't appear. That is because with Drayman you must strictly tell when a component needs to be re-rendered. It can be done by using a special &lt;a href="http://www.drayman.io/docs/components-in-depth/helpers/introduction"&gt;helper function&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import it and add to &lt;code&gt;onchange&lt;/code&gt; event after selected file was saved:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promises&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DraymanComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Select a file to view it directly from file system&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;forceUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectedFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;utf-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;pre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now our component is complete and file contents is shown on select:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQa0-OaA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0ed55qu01a43ofyx938.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YQa0-OaA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0ed55qu01a43ofyx938.gif" alt="blog-getting-started-final-result"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have built a component which combines server-side logic and client-side view in a single script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not really into reviews and all that sort of things so don't be judging=)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who works in the digital field is looking for ways to improve their work processes and minimize risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A private mobile proxy is a great tool for working with social media and instant messengers. People use smartphones for Facebook, Instagram, etc. Social media are aware of this and therefore are loyal to the IP addresses of mobile providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The telecom providers have very few bunches of these IPs: a lot of people use thousands of addresses. The algorithms of social media are unable to block or flag such IPs because it will take effect on the huge number of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a SEO specialist, I use 4G Mobile IPs for work regularly. I've tried different providers like Proxy Guys, DSL Rentals, Storm Proxies, Proxy Army, etc. Well, some of them are stable, some not. Many providers are overpriced considering the service you get but I think DSL Rentals looks like kinda exception. Their service is worth every single dime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the opportunity to change IP every minute. I've never had such a clean IP pool no matter what state I'm using.  For all the time of usage, I've never faced the problem of black-listed IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I've noticed they have Residential DSL lines as well if you need to work in a specific state or even city. Those proxies are not shared, but individual. Therefore when you buy a line you are the only user of a residential internet connection which is really cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can recommend them if you're into SEO and all this marketing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proxy providers that I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://proxyguys.com/"&gt;https://proxyguys.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://proxyarmy.com/"&gt;https://proxyarmy.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://panel.dslrentals.com/"&gt;https://panel.dslrentals.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stormproxies.com/"&gt;https://stormproxies.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>a log of executed tmux commands</title>
      <author>Waylon Walker</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:21:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/a-log-of-executed-tmux-commands-26ii</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/waylonwalker/a-log-of-executed-tmux-commands-26ii</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we push the limits of tmux further and further you are bound to end up in a&lt;br&gt;
situation where you are mashing down a hotkey and it's just not doing what you&lt;br&gt;
want it to do, and you have no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;show-messages&lt;/code&gt; is a tmux command that can be used to show what tmux is&lt;br&gt;
actually doing behind the scenes.  This might highlight any hot key conflicts&lt;br&gt;
you might have in your &lt;code&gt;~/.tmux.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#man-page-for-showmessages"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  man page for show-messages
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you wnat more information about show-messages, here is the man page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;show-messages &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-JT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; target-client]
            &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;: showmsgs&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        Show server messages or information.  Messages are stored, up to a
        maximum of the limit &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;by the message-limit server option.  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-J&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-T&lt;/span&gt;
        show debugging information about &lt;span class="nb"&gt;jobs &lt;/span&gt;and terminals.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>SQL Query into Pandas DataFrame - Part 1</title>
      <author>Dendi Handian</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:16:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dendihandian/sql-query-into-pandas-dataframe-part-1-1a3j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dendihandian/sql-query-into-pandas-dataframe-part-1-1a3j</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-playground-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Playground Database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm using a database from &lt;a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/chinook.zip"&gt;sqlitetutorial.net&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/"&gt;SQLite Browser&lt;/a&gt; to play with queries. From the database, I will only use one table: let's say it's the &lt;code&gt;Albums&lt;/code&gt; table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For The Python playground, I'm using Jupyter Notebook by &lt;a href="https://www.anaconda.com/"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt;. And to import a table into Pandas DataFrame, we just need to export a table into csv file and this could be done using SQLite Browser, or you can get it from my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/dendihandian/653d16b314c2e51be9e0062df3e2fe2b#file-albums-csv"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparing-the-dataframe"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparing the Dataframe
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume the &lt;code&gt;albums.csv&lt;/code&gt; file is in the same directory as your python or ipynb file, then we can load it into pandas dataframe like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;albums_df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"albums.csv"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-sql-queries-into-pandas-dataframe"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic SQL Queries into Pandas Dataframe
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;albums&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;albums_df&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#select-one-column"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Select One Column
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#select-more-columns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Select More Columns
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;albums&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
