      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important talking points for programmers is which path they want to go down. Do you want to be a freelancer or an employee that works for a company. Let's compare the two and see what the difference is between both of them. They both have their pros and cons however there is nothing stopping you from alternating between the two throughout your developer career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#freelancers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Freelancers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancers are the type of people who are self employed. They often work with multiple clients as they are not tied down to a company structure where they would be expected to work on a few or less projects at a time. One of the defining qualities of a freelancer is having the freedom to do what ever you want and follow your own set of rules. Being your own boss comes with countless advantages as you are solely responsible for all the work that you do. You create and live to your own personal standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant difference between Freelancers and Employees is that Freelancers don't usually have a team of people that they work with. I suppose it could be compared to that of a lone wolf going off on their own and finding their own feet in the world. Freedom does lead to an increase in creativity though and with it comes many benefits such as remote working and setting your own work hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However with it comes downsides. For one Freelancers have to pay their own taxes and it is not quite as fun when you have to spend a long time sorting through all of your paperwork to make sure that you are getting paid the correct amount and dealing with all of the numbers. Company employees don't need to worry about any of this finance stuff as they have accounting and payroll departments that do all this stuff for them. All they have to do is work and they get paid weekly or monthly depending on what company they work for and the structure there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another drawback of being a Freelancer is that you don't get any company perks like bonuses, healthcare, company car or stocks... It is also a little bit more difficult to have protection and union rights like companies do. This was a problem recently because of the coronavirus when furloughed workers were still getting paid whereas self employed were left out to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#company-employees"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Company Employees
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company employees are permanent workers who get paid a fixed salary. Unlike Freelancers they have permanent employment where their income is guaranteed each month so long as they work for the company. In contrast Freelancers income is dependent on the work they get. If there is no work then they can go weeks or even months with no stable income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees also have scheduled work hours for the week where they are expected to either be in the office or remote working from home during those hours. Freelancers can work as much or as little as they want any day of the week including weekends. Company employees normally work week days only for office work although weekends can be an option too if overtime is required or if the job dictates that you should be available for weekends too. Like in the retail and restaurant industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are working as an employee at a company you will usually be working alongside other people in a team based atmosphere. Working in a team is a really great way to make new friends and collaborate on the projects that you work on. This is an area where Freelancers miss out because the job itself is for one person unless they outsource some of the work to others. But as a plus Freelancers are not required to work overtime whereas employees might have to do so and without extra pay because they don't have an hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perks and bonuses can be included within the contract itself and you have a team based learning environment where you can get help from your colleagues if you find yourself stuck on a problem. The ability to have more than one brain trying to solve a problem makes it far easier to troubleshot issues. Compare that with a Freelancer who could often be stuck on a problem for hours that could have been solved within minutes with help from a team member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever path you choose to go down know that you are going to learn something new either way. If you want to have as much flexibility and freedom as possible then go down the freelancer route. However if you need stability in your life and colleagues that have your back then working for a company is a safe bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

      <title>Jumping on the Crypto Train</title>
      <author>Aditya</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/adityavinodh/jumping-on-the-crypto-train-51kp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LdVuPkRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3q1q2ejukyejk8oioa5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LdVuPkRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i3q1q2ejukyejk8oioa5.jpg" alt="Banner Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-cryptocurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a cryptocurrency?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies are a form of a completely digital currency. You might think it is similar to online banking, or credit or debit cards, but all of these methods still involve a middle man - your bank or card providers. Cryptocurrencies use a technology called the blockchain to completely get rid of any third person. You can directly make transactions with whoever you want, in a secure manner, without involving any other person. There are a few popular examples of these digital currencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the recently trending Dogecoin. Bitcoin was the first major, successful attempt at a cryptocurrency, and the following currencies that were created using similar technology (but with minor differences), are called altcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the blockchain?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not too important to know the specifics, but most cryptocurrencies rely on this technology to function. In simple terms, the blockchain is a chronological ledger or chain of data that is updated and synchronised across multiple computers across the internet. Every transaction is public, including the unique identification for both parties involved in the transaction, and the amount transfered. There is a complex cryptographic task that the computers must solve and agree on. This is why every transaction takes around a few minutes or sometimes hours to get approved and verified. Due to this design, the data or transactions can never be "hacked" or changed. It is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O8BqpKBZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.slalom.com%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252Finline-images%252Fblockchain-diagram-2-100.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O8BqpKBZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.slalom.com%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252Finline-images%252Fblockchain-diagram-2-100.jpg%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="Blockchain Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use it?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is meant to be a replacement for traditional currencies, but it is far from becoming widely adopted. To actually use these cryptocurrencies, you first need a wallet. This can be a physical hardware wallet that you can buy, or a digital wallet that you can download, like a mobile app. Using an app as a wallet is the easiest, and is what I recomment. You can use an app like &lt;a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/"&gt;Coinbase Wallet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://metamask.io/"&gt;Metamask&lt;/a&gt;. You need to buy and trade cryptocurrencies from an exchange. Make sure to do your research and use a reliable one. You can use your bank account or credit/debit card to purchase the cryptocurrency of your choice. For beginners, I recommend something like &lt;a href="https://uphold.com/"&gt;Uphold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com/"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; (Different from Coinbase Wallet). Once you are done with the purchase, these exchanges usually provide a hosted wallet which is where your crypto will be stored. It is okay to leave it there, but it is usually recommended to transfer it to a separate wallet for security reasons. So, from the hosted wallet on one of these exchanges, you can transfer the cryptocurrency to your own wallet (something like Metamask), or even withdraw it to your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fees-and-costs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fees and costs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact fees and cost of the transactions will vary depending on which exchange you use, but most exchanges, especially new ones, have a 0% commission and fees policy for transfering from one crypto to another, and sometimes for also buying. But you often have to pay a network fee when withdrawing to a bank account or transfering to your or someone else's wallet. This fees depends on the network, and is often called network fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-to-consider"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Things to consider
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#purpose-of-the-cryptocurrency"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Purpose of the cryptocurrency
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every currency is created with a specific purpose in mind. Consider this while making a decision to purchase or invest in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and Ethereum for example, are very popular currencies, but are also quite slow compared to other altcoins. It takes longer for transactions to complete, and have high network fees. It is okay if you are planning to make a long term investment, but it is usually not recommended for small, frequent transactions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (Not Bitcoin (BTC)) is an example of an altcoin which is a fork from Bitcoin. It was made in order to be fast and scalable, and has a much lower network fee than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cryptocurrency-networks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cryptocurrency networks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple cryptocurrencies or tokens can use the same network to operate and function. Bitcoin uses the bitcoin network, ehtereum uses the ethereum network, Basic Attention Token (BAT - Used by the Brave browser) also uses the ethereum network, and Bitcoin Cash uses its own Bitcoin Cash network. The network used by the currency or token is important to consider, because it determines if you can convert it to another token, and how much network fees you will need to pay. Certain wallets like the Coinbase Wallet, only allow you to convert tokens to others if they use the Ethereum Network, other tokens can be stored and used, but not be converted to other forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#should-you-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Should you use it?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, and therefore have a high risk. The value of your tokens can drastically change everyday, and thus pose a problem to be used as a daily currency. But, if you want to explore and try it out, its definitely something to dig deeper into. I would recommend to start with $10 - $15 as it is mostly the minimum amount required for the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-started-for-free"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get started for free
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6P8cKomP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcoindrift.io%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2019%252F04%252FScreenshot-2019-04-25-at-15.36.18.png%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6P8cKomP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcoindrift.io%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2019%252F04%252FScreenshot-2019-04-25-at-15.36.18.png%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="Brave Rewards"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the Brave browser, which I highly recommend, you get paid for watching optional advertisements that are completely privacy focused. You get paid in BAT (Basic Attention Token) which is based on the Ethereum Network. You can link it with an Uphold account. Once you reach a sufficient balance, you can transfer it to your own wallet. No credit/debit cards are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nfts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  NFTs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NFTs stands for Non Fungible Tokens. These are getting a lot of hype recently, and are in simple terms, a digital collectible. Its like collecting stamps or coins, but a digital version of that. They are also based on the blockchain, and help people purchase unique, non-replacable digital items, like a Tweet, an image, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You're on FIRE! 🔥...in the WRONG way: a story about burnout 😵</title>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello fellow devs! Hope this post finds you well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'd like to talk about a topic that is close to my heart. I have been hesitant to share this one since it puts me in a vulnerable spot. But here goes nothing. I hope you learn something from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obligatory Disclaimer 🚨&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are struggling with mental health issues, please consider seeking help from a professional (if you haven't). This blog is not intended to serve as medical advice. The opinions and thoughts expressed below are my own. Proceed at your own discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Obligatory Disclaimer 🚨&lt;/strong&gt;: If you haven't experienced burnout or don't believe in it, fine by me. Just don't go invalidating my experience or that of others. I will NOT stand for it but will certainly not bother hiding any nasty comments anyone leaves on this post. I'm much better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-trip-in-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A trip in time 🚀
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around 2018, I was going through a rough patch. My life was a mess, especially on the personal level. I'll spare you the unnecessary details. In a nutshell: I hated everything. I didn't want to deal with college. I didn't care about hanging out with friends. Heck, even getting out of my bed and taking a shower seemed like a drag. What was happening to me? The answer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-had-a-burnout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ...I had a burnout 🔥
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm the type that is very self-aware, in case you were wondering. At that time, I was feeling something I had never felt before. I could hardly put how I felt into words, but the best I managed to say with regards to it was: "I feel very demotivated. Nothing really interests me anymore". A coach at the university advised me to go see the student counselor. So I did that. I made an appointment with her, went to see her and explained my situation to her. She suggested I do a thing or two, but before going much further, she asked for my student ID number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment I already knew what was gonna happen next. Despite my clairvoyance, I gave her my student ID number. She then peeked at my grades and said: "You're grades are great! There's no reason for you to feel demotivated. This is just a phase in your life." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up that first session and she told me to make an appointment for our next session. I never did that. I bet she had good intentions, but I lost all trust in her the moment she made it about my grades. I was going through far more serious things on a personal level. My grades were absolutely secondary in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that whole ordeal, I did visit a psychologist, which at least served to confirm that I indeed was experiencing a burnout. Again, I'll save you the details, since that's not the point of this post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cool-but-what-exactly-is-a-burnout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cool, but what exactly is a burnout? 🤔
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you haven't experienced a burnout yourself, you must be wondering what a burnout is like. Well, I'll tell you and I'll try to be as detailed as possible here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer 🚨&lt;/strong&gt;: Do not take this to be the only truth out there. This is MY experience. Other folks probably had it much worse than myself. Do bear that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way I can put it is as follows: you feel empty and demotivated. Say I enjoyed coding and learning new things. POOF! 💥 Gone. When burnout knocked on my door, all of that went to sh!t. I no longer cared about anything. I doubted my career choice. I dreaded the university and the responsibilities that came with it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving my bed in the morning was difficult, to say the least. I felt exhausted throughout the whole day. My exhaustion was mental, but manifested itself in a physical manner. My body felt heavy. No matter how much I slept, that exhaustion never went away. Ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My appetite was also taking blows. I didn't feel like eating much. I didn't even feel like leaving my room, or the house. The sole idea of having to show face and interact with other people in the outside world made me anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grooming myself was a drag too. I just didn't feel like it. I looked forward to absolutely NOTHING. I didn't want to see anyone or speak to anyone. I had effectively isolated myself at this point. I hardly left the house, only leaving if it was absolutely necessary and unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gT9n0oDg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fwww.healthline.com%252Fhlcmsresource%252Fimages%252Ftopic_centers%252F2018-10%252F9329-stages-of-burnout-1296x1715-infographic-1-signs-body.jpg%253Fw%253D1155%2526h%253D3601%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gT9n0oDg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fwww.healthline.com%252Fhlcmsresource%252Fimages%252Ftopic_centers%252F2018-10%252F9329-stages-of-burnout-1296x1715-infographic-1-signs-body.jpg%253Fw%253D1155%2526h%253D3601%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="signs of burnout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tips-for-identifying-and-preventing-burnout"&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on for forever, but I take it that the picture is (somewhat) clear to you by now. Before moving on to the next section, allow me to provide you with a "scientific" definition of burnout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coined by the psychologist, Herbert Freudenberger in the 1970s, burnout describes a severe stress condition that leads to severe physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much worse than ordinary fatigue, burnout makes it challenging for people to cope with stress and handle day-to-day responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People experiencing burnout often feel like they have nothing left to give and may dread getting out of bed each morning. They may even adopt a pessimistic outlook toward life and feel hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tips-for-identifying-and-preventing-burnout#whats-burnout"&gt;Cited from this source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case this doesn't seem sufficiently alarming to you, let me tell you something. If untreated, burnout can result in serious physical AND psychological illness. Yes, burnout can lead to depression, heart disease and even diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact (actually not fun at all): depression has been linked to a weakened immune system. Proof that I'm not making this up can be found &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/how-does-mood-affect-immunity#1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For more info on the effects of depression in your body, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/effects-on-body"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-stages-of-a-burnout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The stages of a burnout
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While browsing the net to provide you with sound information, I stumbled upon two kinds of articles: those naming 5 stages and those naming 12 stages of burnout. I'll highlight both since both of them are equally good, in my humble opinion. Feel free to skip to the subsection you'd like to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-12-stages-of-burnout"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 12 stage model of burnout was developed by psychologists Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North. The 12 stages they describe are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;The Compulsion to Prove Oneself&lt;/strong&gt;: At this stage the individual becomes obsessed with demonstrating their worth through their work or otherwise.&lt;br&gt;
2) &lt;strong&gt;Working Harder&lt;/strong&gt;: In this stage the individual becomes unable to "switch off"; they can no longer leave things for tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;
3) &lt;strong&gt;Neglecting Needs&lt;/strong&gt;: In this stage erratic sleeping habits, eating disruptions and extreme lack of social interactions start to manifest. The individual neglects these basic needs.&lt;br&gt;
4) &lt;strong&gt;Displacement of Conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;: This stage is where problems are dismissed and pushed on someone else. The individual may look for someone to blame for how they feel instead of acknowledging that they are pushing themselves too much. &lt;br&gt;
5) &lt;strong&gt;Revision of Values&lt;/strong&gt;: Values that previously mattered to the individual are dismissed entirely. Hobbies are no longer interesting, you distance yourself from family and friends. Work typically consumes everything in the individual's life and is the only focus they have.&lt;br&gt;
6) &lt;strong&gt;Denial of Emerging Problems&lt;/strong&gt;: In this stage the individual becomes very intolerant and may start to perceive colleagues and those around them as stupid, lazy, or incompetent. Additionally, social contacts become harder as the individual experiences cynicism and aggression.&lt;br&gt;
7) &lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal&lt;/strong&gt;: At this point the individual no longer engages in social interactions. Social gatherings are seen as a nuisance by them.&lt;br&gt;
8) &lt;strong&gt;Odd Behavioral Changes&lt;/strong&gt;: At this stage, behavioral changes become obvious to family and friends. The individual is highly irritable and at times aggressive.&lt;br&gt;
9) &lt;strong&gt;Depersonalization&lt;/strong&gt;: Once at this stage, the individual no longer feel attached to life. They even entertain the idea that they no longer have control over their own life.&lt;br&gt;
10) &lt;strong&gt;Inner Emptiness&lt;/strong&gt;: The individual feels empty and may seek to overcome this by engaging in overeating, substance abuse, among other things. This becomes their sole source of "enjoyment".&lt;br&gt;
11) &lt;strong&gt;Depression&lt;/strong&gt;: At this rate, the individual feels lost, thinks that life has lost all meaning and that the future is bleak, dark and completely hopeless.&lt;br&gt;
12) &lt;strong&gt;Burnout Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;: This stage can include total mental and physical collapse. The individual may require a medical intervention at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information presented above was inspired and sourced from &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tips-for-identifying-and-preventing-burnout#stages"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-12-stages-of-burnout-according-to-psychologist.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  The 5 stages of burnout
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we could summarize the 12 stages of burnout in 5 phases. Let's take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-honeymoon-phase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1️⃣ The honeymoon phase
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase typically happens at the beginning of a new endeavor, be it a new business venture or that job promotion you earned recently. All is nice and dandy until the first obstacles arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the characteristics of this phase include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High productivity and energy levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High job satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readily accepting responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme optimism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#onset-of-stress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2️⃣ Onset of stress
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress starts to manifest itself and find a place in your life. You may start losing the optimistic outlook you had at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common signs of onset of stress include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anxiety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoidance of decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change in appetite or diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgetfulness &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neglect of personal needs, among others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#chronic-stress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3️⃣ Chronic stress
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this phase, your occasional becomes a personal resident in your mental space. You are under incredible stress on a frequent basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common signs of chronic stress include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of interest in hobbies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing work deadlines and/or targets more frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent tiredness (chronic exhaustion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical illness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased procrastination (avoidance of responsibility)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-burnout-phase"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4️⃣ The burnout phase
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this phase, symptoms become acute and critical. Professional intervention is highly advisable at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms to look out for include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete neglect of personal needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuation or increase in escapist activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desire to "drop out" of society &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pessimistic outlook on work and life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-doubt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social isolation, among others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#habitual-burnout"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5️⃣ Habitual burnout
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last phase transforms your regular burnout into chronic burnout. Stress is so ingrained in your lifestyle, that you are more likely to experience significant and ongoing mental, physical and emotional problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symptoms that characterize this phase are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burnout syndrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chronic mental and physical fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chronic sadness &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sourced from &lt;a href="https://www.thisiscalmer.com/blog/5-stages-of-burnout"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#the-road-to-recovery-%F0%9F%9B%A3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The road to recovery... 🛣
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...is a long one. Do not think that burnout will be miraculously "cured" overnight. NOPE. In my case, it's safe to say it took at least 3 months, if not more, to get myself back on my feet. Remember: Each individual is different. Some may take longer to go back to "normal", others may need much less time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rwTe69bL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fwww.healthline.com%252Fhlcmsresource%252Fimages%252Ftopic_centers%252F2018-10%252F9329-stages-of-burnout-1296x1740-infographic-3-prevention-body.jpg%253Fw%253D1155%2526h%253D3654%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rwTe69bL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fwww.healthline.com%252Fhlcmsresource%252Fimages%252Ftopic_centers%252F2018-10%252F9329-stages-of-burnout-1296x1740-infographic-3-prevention-body.jpg%253Fw%253D1155%2526h%253D3654%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="prevent burnout"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/tips-for-identifying-and-preventing-burnout"&gt;Image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how did I overcome this? Here's a few things I did to get myself back on track (🚨 This is NOT medical advice!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepting what's going on with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging and addressing my feelings (Instead of ignoring how I feel. I had to come to terms with why I felt the way I did).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journaling/Braindumping (Putting my feelings on paper or simply out of my head).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradually introducing physical activity in my life (even if it meant taking a walk in my backyard).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending time in nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconnecting with family and friends, little by little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting enough sleep (at least 7 hours of sleep).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating well (lots of vegetables and fruits). Hydration plays an important role too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being patient with myself (I'm terrible at this, by the way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I'd add here: &lt;strong&gt;Ask for help&lt;/strong&gt;. You don't have to figure this out on your own. Reach out to someone you trust and are comfortable opening up to. Visit a professional if you feel like you have to (this is quite advisable. Please don't rule this out). And try not to isolate yourself; that does more harm than good. I speak from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know someone that is struggling with a burnout and would like to help lighten the emotional burden, try this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Listen&lt;/strong&gt;. Before you go on and tell the other person: "Do this", "Do that" and "Try this and you'll feel better", just....LISTEN. 👂🏻&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be sure to validate their feelings&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of saying: "Everything's gonna be okay" or "You are just exaggerating things", try saying: "You have been working a lot lately, I can see why you feel depleted". Acknowledge how the person feels and show them that you are there to support them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Offer help, but be specific about it&lt;/strong&gt;. Asking a person who is dealing with burnout "How can I help" will likely yield nothing. They have no energy for that. Instead, be specific about the help you can offer. Maybe you can get them groceries or walk their dog/look after their pet(s). Offer the kind of help you know you can manage to provide and things will surely work out somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Do a random act of kindness&lt;/strong&gt;. You could get them flowers or their favorite pastry at a local bakery. Those who experience burnout tend to feel underappreciated and lonely, so these kind of gestures can warm them up a bit and show them that they are loved and not alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-wrapup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The wrap-up 🌯
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, sorry to keep you on the line for this long. Hope I didn't cause you much boredom. If anything, I hope this was eye-opening 👀 to you and that you have a better understanding of the burnout syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share you experience in the comments (only if you are comfortable doing so. No pressure). Have you experienced a burnout before? If yes, how did you cope with it? 🤔 Be sure to share any helpful resources if you have them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be considerate of others. If you think this burnout is not real and that folks like me are weaklings and exaggerating, keep your words to yourself. However, I won't stop you from expressing yourself. Do remember that there are consequences for those who violate the Code of Conduct of this platform. Just a friendly reminder. 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, folks. Take care of yourselves. The world is a mad place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay sane, see you next time! 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: How about a checklist?&lt;br&gt;

      <title>How to ban users from all chats with TalkJS</title>
      <author>Andrew</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 10:11:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/talkjs/how-to-ban-users-from-all-chats-with-talkjs-30l8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/talkjs/how-to-ban-users-from-all-chats-with-talkjs-30l8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will demonstrate the process of removing a user from conversations, and put security measures in place that ban this user from interacting with chats again. We can ensure the security of your conversations by preventing user impersonation using identity verification, and disabling client-side syncing so users can’t add themselves to conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is deleting the user from a conversation. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deleting-a-user-from-a-conversation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deleting a user from a conversation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TalkJS makes it possible to programmatically add and remove the users in a conversation. You can also restrict access rights, toggle notifications on or off, or set a label for certain people in a conversation. We cannot remove participants from a conversation using the JavaScript SDK, but we can via the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard/tG5nSzBD/docs/Reference/REST_API/Participation.html"&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s use the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard/tG5nSzBD/docs/Reference/REST_API/Participation.html"&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt; to remove a user from a conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path:&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;code&gt;/v1/{appId}/conversations/{conversationId}/participants/{userId}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;    DELETE&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://api.talkjs.com/v1/tG5nSzBD/conversations/order_391_fc/participants/user_924772 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_l9AmGDFY0rHHNM5IqCdpHzI2e2e0Jd7r" \
-X DELETE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a user is removed from a conversation they will no longer be listed as a participant in the conversation and the user will not be able to see any new messages sent to the conversation. However, the conversation will still appear in their list of conversations in the Inbox UI, and when the user's conversations are fetched via the REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleting a user like this will remove the access rights the user has to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user can be a participant in a conversation with 3 different access rights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full access ("ReadWrite"): The user is listed in the header, can read and write messages to other participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read-only access ("Read"): The user is listed in the header and can only read, but cannot write messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No access anymore: The user used to be a participant but has since been removed with the DELETE call. The user is not listed in the header for other participants. The moment this user rejoins, they get all the messages that they might have missed. Until then, they see a static view of the conversation with only the messages that were exchanged until they were removed from the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find all of the conversations a user is a participant in by following this &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard/tG5nSzBD/docs/Reference/REST_API/Users.html#page_Listing-conversations-a-user-is-a-part-of"&gt;API reference guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have removed a user from a conversation, can I delete the entire user and their associated data? TalkJS currently does not have a way to delete user data. Instead, could use the edit endpoints to remove any personally identifiable information (PII) associated with the user. There is a script that you can use to automate this process which can be found in the TalkJS &lt;a href="https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/rest-api/anonymizing-user"&gt;GitHub examples repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ensuring-the-security-of-your-talkjs-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ensuring the security of your TalkJS Integration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be exploring two of the main ways you can ensure the integrity of your user’s data and the security of your TalkJS integration as a whole. These two methods are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identity Verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Disabling client-side conversation syncing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by taking a closer look at Identity Verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identity-verification"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identity Verification
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity Verification protects your user's data and prevents user impersonation. With Identity Verification, your backend sends a digital signature of the current user's &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; to TalkJS. This signature cannot normally be forged, so it proves that the current user identified to TalkJS is really the user logged in to your platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-it-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How does it work?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works by generating a hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 signature of the user's id. This is a message authentication scheme supported by all popular programming languages. If Identity Verification is enabled, TalkJS will block any requests without a valid signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#set-up-with-just-one-line-of-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Set up with just one line of code
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, set the &lt;code&gt;signature&lt;/code&gt; property in the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard/tG5nSzBD/docs/Reference/Concepts/Sessions.html"&gt;Talk.Session&lt;/a&gt; object to the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the current user id signed with your TalkJS secret key. This sounds complicated but usually, it can be done in one line of code that you can simply copy and paste. It may look like the following code snippet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.talkSession = new Talk.Session({
    appId: "tG5nSzBD",
    me: me,

    // this is the line that it's all about:
    signature: "&amp;lt;?= hash_hmac('sha256', strval($user-&amp;gt;id), 'SECRET') ?&amp;gt;"
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find the secret key in the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; Your secret key should never leak or appear in your frontend code and should be kept private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve tested it and confirmed it works you can enable Identity Verification in the dashboard, meaning any request without a valid signature will be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TalkJS &lt;a href="https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/creating-signatures"&gt;GitHub examples repository&lt;/a&gt; has code samples that demonstrate how to create a signature in multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes our section on Identity Verification and how to enable it in TalkJS. With this security measure in place, you have immediately improved the level of integrity of your users. Now let’s look at another method for improving security and access, disabling client-side conversation syncing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#disabling-clientside-conversation-syncing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Disabling client-side conversation syncing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you exclusively use the &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard/tG5nSzBD/docs/Reference/REST_API/Getting_Started/Introduction.html"&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt; to create or update TalkJS users and conversations then you may want to disable the ability to create or update via the JavaScript SDK. In the TalkJS &lt;a href="https://talkjs.com/dashboard/"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; you will see the two checkboxes under the security settings section that allow you to disable synchronization via the browser - one for synchronizing users, and one for synchronizing conversation data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mB7A4_4D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ufr7zkv3j364rhj2d9wz.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mB7A4_4D--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ufr7zkv3j364rhj2d9wz.PNG" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If user synchronization via the browser is disallowed, the following code will not work as it tries to add/update the data via the JavaScript SDK:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const me = new Talk.User({
    id: "123456",
    name: "Alice"
    email: "alice@example.com"
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can, however, reference a &lt;code&gt;Talk.User&lt;/code&gt; using only their ID, which will use the details already stored for the user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const me = new Talk.User(123456)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the option to disallow conversation synchronization via the browser is checked, the following will not work as it involves modifying the conversation data using the JavaScript SDK:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Only if the conversation already exists, this will work
const conversation = session.getOrCreateConversation(Talk.oneOnOneId(me, other));

// Trying to set a participant via the SDK will cause an error
conversation.setParticipant(me);
conversation.setParticipant(other);

// Trying to set the conversation's attributes will also cause an error
conversation.setAttributes({
    subject: "Hello world!"
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is how you can successfully disable client-side conversation syncing in TalkJS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#banned-from-the-conversation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Banned from the conversation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both Identity Verification and the option to disallow browser synchronization enabled, you can rest assured that any user you have removed from a conversation remains so, and be effectively banned from performing any further actions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What made me use SWR? </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on a project which have multiple screens and since I am using &lt;strong&gt;react&lt;/strong&gt; I have to deal with several components but when it came to data fetching it wasn't easy to use the hook called &lt;strong&gt;useEffect&lt;/strong&gt;, I was able to control the &lt;em&gt;useEffect&lt;/em&gt; functionalities to some extent using &lt;em&gt;dependency array&lt;/em&gt; but the component was &lt;em&gt;mounting&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unmounting&lt;/em&gt; which made it to &lt;em&gt;refetch&lt;/em&gt; the data every single time. &lt;br&gt;
When I learnt about &lt;strong&gt;SWR&lt;/strong&gt; it kind of gave so many functionalities that I could use to control the number of refetches so the first thing I used was, &lt;strong&gt;dedupingInterval&lt;/strong&gt; here I can set the time interval when I need to refetch the data. &lt;br&gt;
Second thing which I used was, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;mutate(key)&lt;/strong&gt;: what are the other scenarios I would like to refetch or I can say invalidate the old call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a 2D matrix &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt;, handle multiple queries of the following type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the sum of the elements of &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner &lt;code&gt;(row1, col1)&lt;/code&gt; and lower right corner &lt;code&gt;(row2, col2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implement the &lt;code&gt;NumMatrix&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;NumMatrix(int[][] matrix)&lt;/code&gt; Initializes the object with the integer matrix &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;int sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2)&lt;/code&gt; Returns the sum of the elements of &lt;code&gt;matrix&lt;/code&gt; inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner &lt;code&gt;(row1, col1)&lt;/code&gt; and lower right corner &lt;code&gt;(row2, col2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example 1:&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Input:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;["NumMatrix", "sumRegion", "sumRegion", "sumRegion"]&lt;br&gt;[[[[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]], [2, 1, 4, 3], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 4]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Output:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;[null, 8, 11, 12]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explanation:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;NumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix([[3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7], [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]]);&lt;br&gt;numMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3); // return 8 (i.e sum of the red rectangle)&lt;br&gt;numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2); // return 11 (i.e sum of the green rectangle)&lt;br&gt;numMatrix.sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4); // return 12 (i.e sum of the blue rectangle)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1fQ8Rn4I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/sum-grid.jpg" alt="Example 1 Visual"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#constraints"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constraints:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;m == matrix.length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;n == matrix[i].length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;= m, n &amp;lt;= 200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-10^5 &amp;lt;= matrix[i][j] &amp;lt;= 10^5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 &amp;lt;= row1 &amp;lt;= row2 &amp;lt; m&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0 &amp;lt;= col1 &amp;lt;= col2 &amp;lt; n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At most &lt;code&gt;10^4&lt;/code&gt; calls will be made to &lt;code&gt;sumRegion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#idea"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idea:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Jump to&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="#description"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem Description&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; || &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="#javascript-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#python-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#java-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#c-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;C++&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem brings up one of the characteristics of a &lt;strong&gt;2D matrix&lt;/strong&gt;: the sum of the elements in any rectangular range of a matrix (&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;) can be defined mathematically by the overlap of four other rectangular ranges that originate at &lt;strong&gt;M[0][0]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sum of the rectangle &lt;strong&gt;(0,0)-&amp;gt;(i,j)&lt;/strong&gt; is equal to the cell &lt;strong&gt;(i,j)&lt;/strong&gt;, plus the rectangle &lt;strong&gt;(0,0)-&amp;gt;(i,j-1)&lt;/strong&gt;, plus the rectangle &lt;strong&gt;(0,0)-&amp;gt;(i-1,j)&lt;/strong&gt;, minus the rectangle &lt;strong&gt;(0,0)-&amp;gt;(i-1,j-1)&lt;/strong&gt;. We subtract the last rectangle because it represents the overlap of the previous two rectangles that were added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ch7qECh9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/5bxuZB2.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ch7qECh9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/5bxuZB2.gif" alt="Visual 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this information, we can use a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic programming&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;DP&lt;/strong&gt;) approach to build a &lt;strong&gt;prefix sum&lt;/strong&gt; matrix (&lt;strong&gt;dp&lt;/strong&gt;) from &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; iteratively, where &lt;strong&gt;dp[i][j]&lt;/strong&gt; will represent the sum of the rectangle &lt;strong&gt;(0,0)-&amp;gt;(i,j)&lt;/strong&gt;. We'll add an extra row and column in order to prevent out-of-bounds issues at &lt;strong&gt;i-1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;j-1&lt;/strong&gt; (similar to a prefix sum array), and we'll fill &lt;strong&gt;dp&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each cell, we'll add its value from &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;dp&lt;/strong&gt; values of the cell on the left and the one above, which represent their respective rectangle sums, and then subtract from that the top-left diagonal value, which represents the overlapping rectangle of the previous two additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we just reverse the process for &lt;strong&gt;sumRegion()&lt;/strong&gt;: We start with the sum at &lt;strong&gt;dp[R2+1][C2+1]&lt;/strong&gt; (due to the added row/column), then subtract the left and top rectangles before adding back in the doubly-subtracted top-left diagonal rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Even though the test cases will pass when using an int matrix for &lt;strong&gt;dp&lt;/strong&gt;, the values of &lt;strong&gt;dp&lt;/strong&gt; can range from &lt;strong&gt;-4e9&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;4e9&lt;/strong&gt; per the listed constraints, so we should use a data type capable of handling more than &lt;strong&gt;32 bits&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Complexity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;constructor: O(M * N)&lt;/strong&gt; where &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt; are the dimensions of the input matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sumRegion: O(1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Complexity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;constructor: O(M * N)&lt;/strong&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;DP&lt;/strong&gt; matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;constructor: O(1)&lt;/strong&gt; if you're able to modify the input and use an &lt;strong&gt;in-place DP&lt;/strong&gt; approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sumRegion: O(1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Il n'y a pas que le développement web dans la vie.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Il n'y a pas que le web dans la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J'ai l'impression d'être un extra-terrestre quand je dis à mes interlocuteurs :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oui, tu peux entrainer un réseau de neurones en local dans une app mobile pour améliorer l'UX"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oui, on peut faire un serveur web en Kotlin, Swift ou en Go pour du microservice"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Non, on ne traite pas des données (big data) avec du PHP ou du JS, c'est pas fait pour, c'est moins efficient qu'en Python ou qu'en Go"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oui il y a autre chose que WAMP dans la vie, Docker par exemple et ca permet d'avoir des environnements riches et stimulants (l'inverse du classique Apache, Mysql, PHP 5.6 par exemple 🤢)"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Il n'y a pas que le SQL/NoSQL dans la vie, tu peux aussi faire des bases graph, des bases par document, par clé/valeur, etc."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je trouve cela incroyable de constater que 90% des développeurs et décideurs que je rencontre ne voient que 20% du spectre des solutions disponibles pour leur projet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment innover sans connaissances diversifiées ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Et je ne parle pas des technos de développement mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Je suis fou ou le monde est à 90% sur le web mais ce qui fait tourner les gros projets ce n'est pas du web ? (Données, Machine Learning, Application à succès, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, for a few days i've been struggling to upload my old database which was sqlite3 to heroku's Postgres database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Upload that postgresql database to heroku&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

need &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/"&gt;Postgresql&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/download/"&gt;PG Admin&lt;/a&gt; installed in our machine.Go and download and install these 2. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;NOTE: While installing PG Admin it will ask you for a passwords, make sure to remember that password.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to create an empty Postgres Database.&lt;br&gt;
Head into PG Admin, Enter the password that when it ask's for.And follow these steps to create an empty database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#11-click-on-raw-objects-endraw-in-the-top"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.1) Click on &lt;code&gt;Objects&lt;/code&gt; in the top.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JNzX5KfS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JNzX5KfS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_1.jpg" alt="alt text" title="step 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#12-then-click-on-raw-create-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.2) Then click on &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N33vkYwf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_2.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N33vkYwf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_2.jpg" alt="alt text" title="step 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#13-now-we-gotta-create-a-group-namein-this-case-i-named-it-tutorial"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.3) Now we gotta create a group name.In this case i named it Tutorial
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T2iNBcBd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_3.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T2iNBcBd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_3.jpg" alt="alt text" title="step 3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
click on &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt;.Now in the left you can see out new group 'Tutorial'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#14-now-lets-create-the-serverright-click-on-that-tutorail-groupthen-create-gt-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.4) Now let's create the server.Right click on that 'Tutorail' Group.Then Create &amp;gt; Server
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--493Q3mpV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--493Q3mpV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_4.jpg" alt="alt text" title="step 4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#15-fill-up-the-name-i-named-it-convertdb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.5) Fill up the Name, I named it 'CONVERT_DB'
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cn6Two1q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cn6Two1q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_5.jpg" alt="alt text" title="step 5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#16-now-click-on-connection-and-fill-up-hostname-password"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.6) Now click on Connection and fill up 'hostname', 'password'
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2C0DJq7L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_6.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2C0DJq7L--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://upstorage.pythonanywhere.com/api/storage/file/its_sakib/Public/dev.to/posts/post_1/step_6.jpg" alt="alt text" title="step 6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here type &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; in host name/address and in the password input type the password that you gave PG Admin while installing it.And Click SAVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There You go we just created an empty server.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;br&gt;
Now to transfer all of the sqlite3 data to our empty postgresql database.We first have to create a dumpfile from sqlite3
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#17-make-sure-that-you-have-set-the-sqlite3-database-in-your-settingspy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.7) Make sure that you have set the sqlite3 database in your settings.py
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;DATABASES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'default'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'ENGINE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'django.db.backends.sqlite3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'NAME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_DIR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'old_database_name.sqlite3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#18-create-datadumpjson-from-managepy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.8) Create datadump.json from manage.py
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 manage.py dumpdata &amp;gt; datadump.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will create a datadump.json file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Note: Sometime, this generates broken json file so you have to format it yourself if that json file shows any error.Even if you have print('') in settings.py it will add it to the json file.This is a bug so you have to deal with it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#19-now-we-are-going-to-change-the-database-to-the-postgresql-serverso-head-on-to-settingspy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.9) Now we are going to change the DATABASE to the postgresql server.so head on to settings.py
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DATABASES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'default'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'ENGINE'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'django.db.backends.postgresql'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'NAME'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'CONVERT_DB'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The Server name from 1.5
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'USER'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'postgres'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The username from 1.6
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'PASSWORD'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'secretpassword'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The password from installation
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'HOST'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'localhost'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Host name/address from 1.6,
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'PORT'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'5432'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Port from 1.6
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Set the information the the server information. from (1.6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#191-now-migrate-the-empty-database-with-runsyncdb"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.9.1) Now migrate the empty database with --run-syncdb.
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#192-go-to-shell-using-managepy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.9.2) Go to shell using manage.py
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;manage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#193-now-as-you-are-in-shell-type-these-commands"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.9.3) Now as you are in shell type these commands.
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.contrib.contenttypes.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ContentType&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ContentType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;quit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#194-finally-its-time-to-load-our-old-data-to-this-new-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1.9.4) Finally! It's time to load our old data to this new database
&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;manage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;loaddata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datadump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will load the data from our old database to the new database using the datadump.json file that we created from sqlite3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auhhhh! What a relief.We converted the data but, we still got 1 more challange left which is Uploading our new database (with old data) in to heroku.Lets goooo (My cat is on my keyboard xD)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2uploading-the-postgres-database-in-heroku"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2.Uploading the postgres database in heroku
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as you know that you can't upload file to Heroku through their website, You can upload with github but thats a worst way you can do it with risking your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are going to upload the database through heroku CLI.Open Your command prompt and type (Make sure your PG Admin in running.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_dump -Fc --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U USERNAME DATABASE_NAME &amp;gt; mydb.dump
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the 'USERNAME' is the name from the database from (1.6).Defaultly it was set to postgres and i didn't chage it in my case, DATABASE_NAME is the database 'Server name' from (1.5) where i set it to 'CONVERT_DB'.&lt;br&gt;
So in my case the command will be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_dump -Fc --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U postgres CONVERT_DB &amp;gt; mydb.dump
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This will ask for a passwords: which is the password from installation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After you enter the password This will create a mydb.dump file.So if you've got through this far then congrats we are really close.And if you got any error just give a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now that we have our mydb.dump file.We can upload it to heroku but to upload it we have to do it via some online file storage service.You have to store the 'mydb.dump' file to the cloud and make it public to it's accessible from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can upload it to aws, or any other file server.But the link should be the direct download link, like if you paste it to the browser it will automatically start downloading. Now it could be overwelming and it's a bit hard since there's no easy way for free.If you got stuck here then just comment below i will try to help you out with the cloud storing easily. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we have the dump_file_link we can upload it to heroku&lt;br&gt;
our imaginary dump_file_link is '&lt;a href="https://some_cloud_server/path/to/file.dump"&gt;https://some_cloud_server/path/to/file.dump&lt;/a&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we upload make sure you have heroku cli installed and are logged in.Make sure to delete the old database from heroku and create a new fresh database there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#20-open-command-prompt-and-type"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2.0) Open command prompt and type
&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku pg:backups:restore &amp;lt;'dump_file_link'&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will ask for you conformation and you have to enter your app name to confirm and KABOOM!!! You'r database is now updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I just started using heroku a few days ago and im still figuring out stuffs.If i weren't able to help then im sorry for that but i actually tried my best to solve it in a post an d you know its hard to solve overwelming problems in just a post.Anyway if you made it so far Congratulations!!!!!! Now i'll go and take a nap with my cat. see ya ;) Meow uwu&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Add a loader to your website</title>
      <author>Clément Gaudinière</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 08:35:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/clementgaudiniere/add-a-loader-to-your-website-eag</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/clementgaudiniere/add-a-loader-to-your-website-eag</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, today we will learn how to add a loader to our website ! Loaders have been used for a long time, it has been proven that users are more patient when a loader is present on a website. That's why I propose to set up a loader that will disappear when the whole page is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will set up our HTML :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag with the id &lt;code&gt;containerLoader&lt;/code&gt; will hold the loader (as the name suggests 😉).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag having the class &lt;code&gt;containerText&lt;/code&gt;, will allow to contain all the content of the page, both text and images&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"containerLoader"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"containerLoader"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"lds-ripple"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"containerText"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm the title&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Your text here&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#second-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Second step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we set up our loader, with some CSS.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.lds-ripple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.lds-ripple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lds-ripple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.lds-ripple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:nth-child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-0.5s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lds-ripple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;36px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;72px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;72px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see the result of the loader animation below :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/jOBNVdw?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#third-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Third step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will style our page :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&amp;amp;display=swap")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#252525&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;"Roboto"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.containerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;900px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;90%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.containerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;justify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.containerText&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-align&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* The disappearing animation of the loader */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.hide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation-iteration-count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* The loader container */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;#containerLoader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;/* This last piece of code is purely aesthetic and optional.  */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::-moz-selection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::selection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#last-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Last step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we set up our javascript so that the loader disappears once the page is ready to be displayed.  Good point for some: we won't use jQuery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onreadystatechange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;readyState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;complete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;containerLoader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;containerLoader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-result"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The result
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see below the final result of our loader. If the animation is too fast, you can click on the "Rerun" button to restart the animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/clement-gaudiniere/embed/XWMbMWP?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this tutorial will be useful to you, don't hesitate to use it on your website if you wish and to give me your opinion in comments. 👍&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Get your GitHub Student Developer Pack Now !!</title>
      <author>Sanjay Singh Rajpoot</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 08:12:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sanjaysinghrajpoot/get-your-github-student-developer-pack-now-cb2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sanjaysinghrajpoot/get-your-github-student-developer-pack-now-cb2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Github has collaborated with the tech industry to create a package that will include all the resources that a student need while graduating. GitHub Education offers students real-world experience with free access to various developer tools from GitHub’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pack is open to every student 13 years or older👨‍🎓 in a degree-granting program. Most students apply for the Pack using their school-issued email address. However, students whose schools don’t provide email addresses are able to apply for the Pack using their dated student ID. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-avail-github-pack-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to avail Github pack 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it's pretty straight forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: &lt;br&gt;
First of all go to the following link: &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack"&gt;https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RsM5Y5G3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/slwjs5s756o2ukcjal6c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RsM5Y5G3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/slwjs5s756o2ukcjal6c.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: &lt;br&gt;
log in to your GitHub account in order to avail the Student Developer Pack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: &lt;br&gt;
Clicking on “Get your Pack” will prompt you to sign up with your GitHub account so that it can authorize your profile with the request for the pack, and confirm that you are a student and are older than 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4: &lt;br&gt;
After signing up, you will have to submit some basic information:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutional email ID( An IEEE email address would suffice if you don’t have an institutional one)
Name of your institution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To confirm that we are actually a student, we are asked to upload a validation — a school ID or a letter. It should show our current status as a student.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d_bLjpTY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t4mvn2fhuvnvgbjige47.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete list - &lt;a href="https://education.github.com/pack"&gt;https://education.github.com/pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! That is the last introduction article to solve some mental problems before starting the real work! Hopefully, it will be useful for a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inspiration-is-in-the-air"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inspiration is in the air
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can sound dumb, but your mental health have a big influence on your work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be in a good mood to start thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be in a quiet place with no people around. It is your time to have confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget all problems. Remember, the hardest thing - is the start. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it today. Tomorrow you will easier deny this idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never stop. If you stop, you have to make everything once again from the very beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be afraid. Although you aren't a popular programmer that earns a lot, remember, every person is individual. Some people will find your ideas fresh and interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#real-inspiration-real-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Real inspiration, real experience
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, people who start their way, don't make any explosions of ideas. Everyone needs real experience to understand, what is needed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep abreast of the latest events, news in the world of web development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit popular communities to check opinion of developers. (&lt;a href="https://www.webdeveloper.com"&gt;Webdevelopper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.designerhangout.co"&gt;Designerhangout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forums.digitalpoint.com"&gt;Digitalpoint&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the websites-stores with templates (&lt;a href="https://creativemarket.com/templates/websites"&gt;Creativemarket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.templatemonster.com"&gt;Templatemonster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://dribbble.com/tags/buy"&gt;Dribbble&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google for colour picker and make some interesting matches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal to make something that is not used by others, something yours. Even if you find your design of website bad, some people will find it creative. Things that become popular are new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start and make something yours, your future projects will be getting better and better, as you are a child that learns &lt;em&gt;how to draw&lt;/em&gt; - the more you draw, the better you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next article will be dedicated to some project. I will share my point of view on &lt;em&gt;how to make a website the most effective way&lt;/em&gt; and we will move to the real things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow me for updates!&lt;/p&gt;
