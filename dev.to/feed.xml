      <title>How to create a Nexus Repository with Windows Containers</title>
      <author>Federico Navarrete</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/fanmixco/how-to-create-a-nexus-repository-with-windows-containers-e0p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker is an extremely powerful tool. You often build your own image using X image or X Linux distros like Ubuntu or Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we have a Nexus repository running in Windows but we started to move everything to AWS. The greatest challenge happened when we were not able to migrate the DB. Regardless, the configuration we chose, the repo started to crash over and over again. The only option was to move the old VM as a new EC2 which was a bad deal since this would be our only EC2 because the rest was running in containers in ECS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, we thought of a new solution, we had heard about Windows Containers, something that is not so well-known. And this is the solution that we came with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809
RUN mkdir "c:\\nexus"
WORKDIR c:/nexus
RUN mkdir sonatype-work
RUN mkdir nexus-3.36.0-01
COPY nexus-3.36.0-01 .
COPY sonatype-work .
WORKDIR c:/nexus/nexus-3.36.0-01/bin
EXPOSE 8081
CMD ["nexus.exe /run"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first line downloads a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Windows Nano Server&lt;/strong&gt;, which has the smallest footprint. And later, we configured the location that we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number &lt;strong&gt;3.36.0-01&lt;/strong&gt; represents our current version of the Nexus repo, it can change over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, something important to highlight, this solution doesn't show any logs for any reason and takes some time to run it the first time. So, if you start hitting: &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8081&lt;/code&gt; in minute one, it might not work, it takes a while maybe 3 to 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey From Nothing to Game Designer</title>
      <author>Mr. Unity Buddy</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 12:48:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/my-journey-from-nothing-to-game-designer-487k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/unitybuddy/my-journey-from-nothing-to-game-designer-487k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, buddies!! Today is something special for me, it's my Birthday 🙈🙈  So, I was thinking about what should I write on this day and someone from myself told me "Why don't you write about your first &lt;code&gt;Hello, World&lt;/code&gt;?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3eXJUyrk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635961918664/NNWNFF53l.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3eXJUyrk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635961918664/NNWNFF53l.png" alt="image.png" width="480" height="360"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#30-mpd-gaming"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  30 MPD Gaming 🥴
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NYEp6RJq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635959981605/y1J1PiIXE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NYEp6RJq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635959981605/y1J1PiIXE.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Almost every game designer is a Gamer(It's a must!). So it was the same with me but I played games only for 30 minutes, maximumly, 1 hour. I know, I know a normal person plays a video game for at least 2 hours. The reason with me wasn't that I'm not interested in Gaming, but I had a lot, I mean a really lot of studies and work to do. Besides, I can't play well-performing games on my old windows 8 laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I never wanted to be a Game Designer, even though I love video games. I was just a simple buddy who have never heard of C#, Game Engines, Github, etc. One day, everything was changed. I can't remember why I was forced to watch Brackey's Cube Run tutorial, maybe I watched it for fun. But that's the day my real-life got started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-the-first-ever-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making the First ever Game
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day that I watched Brackey's tutorial, I got a Unity ID and installed Unity and other stuff. Must say that it took me a day to set up Projects with my Old windows 8. But I still wonder that how I was able to install Unity on my machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, my first piece of code wasn't &lt;code&gt;Hello, World&lt;/code&gt;; it was &lt;code&gt;public Rigidbody Rb;&lt;/code&gt; 😋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to make an actual copy of the Cube Run game but I changes the concept a little bit, actually a lot in the middle of the project. &lt;br&gt;
This is a very, very simple game that can be made in a day. But trust me, it took me 2 months to finish this. I learned so many things and I still believe that it wasn't a waste of time, never! I found a community, I learned how to get used to resources around me, and most importantly, a bug that wasted your day may get fixed on the next day without any effort! 🐛&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-ontriggerenter-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;OnTriggerEnter&lt;/code&gt; 😆
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often experience this so I never forgot this &lt;strong&gt;bug&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OnTriggerEnter&lt;/code&gt; function is used to do something when the Player passes through a trigger. So simply, it was not working. I put Debug.Logs,  used similar somewhat similar functions to see whether it is a problem with physics or something. And tried to get help from experts even. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They told me different things like "you might as well check the collision matrix", "You should first put a debug.log outside of the if so you know if the problem is with the od part or the ontriggrenter part" and so many things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sh-THzfo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635786271590/REdy6NlWb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sh-THzfo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635786271590/REdy6NlWb.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bruh 😑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of them suggested turning on Mesh Renderer :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mMbQ1N_1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635785716120/HCtXI2dsZ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mMbQ1N_1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635785716120/HCtXI2dsZ.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="553"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it can't collide with the Trigger if it is above the Player 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finding-a-niche"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finding a Niche
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a typical absolute beginner, I wanted to make a game that will become a trend and have Millions of downloads! So, I thought that a game like a COD will help me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make a simple FPS game from a Unity Template. After 2 or 3 days of playing with it, I realized that FPS isn't for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By those days, I attended Unity's Create with Code live sessions and they taught me to make a good RPG game. Wow, that's so easy! I will make this for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I played some time with RPG games as well. Though they are easy to understand than FPS games, I found that was Boring for me and I don't have a passion for RPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my first game has been played by near about 200 Unity devs and I got good feedback as it was my first ever game. And One day, A Hyper-casual game studio asked me to join their team as a 1st Tier Developer. And boom, they said my game has a good Hyper-casual look. Why didn't I think about Hyper-Casual!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only about 2 and a half months I have started with Unity but I didn't want to miss this chance 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#firstever-colloboration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First-ever Colloboration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were using Github for collab as usual but I was troubling what an erratic thing is this! Of course, they got confused when I said I don't know Github but I just told them that I have only used Unity's itself Collab feature and it went OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZDaf4pJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635783563093/1WzERPiKa.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZDaf4pJK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635783563093/1WzERPiKa.gif" alt="hammaya-relaxed.gif" width="220" height="249"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the team lead was kind enough to teach me about this and how to set it up. Although I didn't understand how it exactly works, I got it after a few days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-game"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Game
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sEfXbH1s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635960453902/OxSMQH__c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sEfXbH1s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635960453902/OxSMQH__c.png" width="249" height="512"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was half-made a one. We had to do a lot of things, Shop, Leaderboard, Power-ups, Bug fixes, and a lot! But I didn't find it stressful just because our team had at least 2 people in almost every role! Head Programmers, 1st Tier Devs, 2nd Tier Devs, 3D modelers, Sound artists, Testers, etc. Every task is divided and it was my baby steps to Project Management and Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jXUtEpLV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635784731119/3u1yuJw0q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jXUtEpLV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635784731119/3u1yuJw0q.png" alt="image.png" width="880" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time that we finished and published the game, I left them because it didn't seem official anymore. A few members were joined and they are thinking everyone is the same as them or something and the real-talented people left the team. I didn't think that I should be there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I got another offer from a Great team to work with them as a Content Creator! I hope this is gonna be better than before 🤞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#goodbye-unity-will-see-you-again"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Good-Bye, Unity, will see you again! 👋
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, I'm gonna take a little break from the game design, just because I got a new role to work with I think this is gonna be the same with writing future but I try my best to manage them all. Just don't think I'm giving up haha ✌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all for now. Thanks a lot for reading this self-centered article. Goodbye and happy coding! See you soon 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share with the community the source code of a fullstack web application that I have just developed using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack demonstrating basic features of a bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this would be a good resource for anyone who enjoys learning Javascript in general and MERN stack in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The live demo is accessible at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bn-bookstore.herokuapp.com/#/"&gt;https://bn-bookstore.herokuapp.com/#/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frontend and Backend source code is available at:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React Loading State Pattern using Toast &amp; SWR</title>
      <author>Theodorus Clarence</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 12:28:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/theodorusclarence/react-loading-state-pattern-using-toast-swr-hkn</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/theodorusclarence/react-loading-state-pattern-using-toast-swr-hkn</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing the react loading state can be a bit annoying, we need to set it to isLoading before fetching, then set it back to false after it is done. Then we also need to set it up to the button so we can show the loading state, or give some text as an indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what it looks like with the common loading pattern:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Pokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;PokemonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20')
    .then((res) =&amp;gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;)
    .finally(() =&amp;gt; setIsLoading(false));
};

return &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;it is annoying to do, and we didn't even cover error state yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-should-we-manage-in-a-loading-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What should we manage in a loading process?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are fetching data, we need to do some things so the waiting experience can be more bearable. Here are some things that we can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#loading-indicator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Loading indicator
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users need to know when their application is in a loading state. This is important so they are not blankly waiting, and get the mindset that they should wait for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading indicator can be a spinner, normal text, some animations, or toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#success-indicator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Success indicator
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to tell the user if the loading has succeeded, so they can continue with their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#error-indicator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Error indicator
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the data fetching goes wrong, we have to let the user know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blocking-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blocking action
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common example is when we are submitting a form, we don't want the user to submit twice. We can do that by disabling the button when there is a loading state going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is blocking the modal close button when loading, so the user doesn't accidentally close it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-easy-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The easy way
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found that this pattern is the most hassle-free, and we can use custom hooks to grab the loading state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what we are going to build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PG05lNIm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xirmhf1edqxcqy4fio1u.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PG05lNIm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xirmhf1edqxcqy4fio1u.gif" alt="normal fetch using axios" width="800" height="515"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getData button is clicked, then there is a loading toast showing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it is loading, the button is disabled and showing a loading spinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 2 seconds, the loading toast turns into an error toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getData button is clicked again, then there is a loading toast showing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 2 seconds, the loading toast turns into a success toast, then all the data loads correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps: the wait cursor is kind of weird in the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this pattern, we get all 4 things covered, &lt;strong&gt;easily&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get the loading state using toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can show error indicator and show the error message from the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can show success indicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last, all buttons are disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using &lt;strong&gt;React Hot Toast&lt;/strong&gt; for the loading, success, and error indicator. All of it are managed only using 1 wrapper function like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;PokemonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20')
    .then((res) =&amp;gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;),
  &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Data fetched successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Something is wrong, please try again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to install the react-hot-toast&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;yarn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I'm using Next.js for the demo, but the config for CRA is basically the same. Add this to the &lt;code&gt;_app.tsx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;next/app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@/styles/globals.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;DismissableToast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@/components/DismissableToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AppProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;DismissableToast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pageProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I added a dismiss button because it doesn't have it by default, you can grab the &lt;code&gt;DismissableToast&lt;/code&gt; code from &lt;a href="https://theodorusclarence.com/library/toast#dismissabletoast"&gt;my library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to fetch data on mount from an external API using Axios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just need to wrap the axios call with the toast function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;PokemonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20')
      .then((res) =&amp;gt; &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPokemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;),
    &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Data fetched successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Something is wrong, please try again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  );
}, []);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it! The toast will show status when loading, and when it is a success or an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#further-reusablity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Further Reusablity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can compose it even more by declaring the &lt;code&gt;defaultToastMessage&lt;/code&gt;, then overriding it if you need to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultToastMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Data fetched successfully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// you can type this with axios error&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Something is wrong, please try again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultToastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Override loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessing-loading-state"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessing loading state
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what if we want to get that loading state to disable a button?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do that with toast API that I wrapped in a custom hook.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useToasterStore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-hot-toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**
 * Hook to get information whether something is loading
 * @returns true if there is a loading toast
 * @example const isLoading = useLoadingToast();
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLoadingToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toasts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useToasterStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toasts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we can use it just like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLoadingToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;isLoading&lt;/code&gt; state, the rest is all your creativity, you can show some skeleton, change the loading text, give loading spinners, anything you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gotcha-2-axios-calls"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Gotcha: 2 Axios Calls
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you got 2 axios calls, you can chain the next axios call, and add another &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; to get the value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/user/login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;jwt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// chaining axios in 1 promise&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;axios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/user/get-user-info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;role&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user_role&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;LOGIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tempToken&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultToastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#swr-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SWR Integration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using SWR to fetch data is even more awesome because we only need to show the loading state on the first fetch. Here is the demo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jNCKUE7k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00sy6u2owzjduns0juj4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jNCKUE7k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00sy6u2owzjduns0juj4.gif" alt="toast-using-swr-fetch" width="800" height="514"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First time visited, a loading toast is shown then turns into success toast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When visited for the second time, there is no loading toast and the data is prefilled with cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the syntax of SWR:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSWR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PokemonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, this is not a promise, how do we use the toast then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use another custom hook ✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this hook so we can wrap the &lt;code&gt;useSWR&lt;/code&gt; just like the &lt;code&gt;toast.promise&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usewithtoast-for-swr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  useWithToast for SWR
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react-hot-toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SWRResponse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;swr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultToastMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@/lib/helper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLoadingToast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@/hooks/useLoadingToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OptionType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;runCondition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useWithToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;swr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SWRResponse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;runCondition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customMessages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;OptionType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;swr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;idle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultToastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customMessages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;runCondition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if toastStatus is done,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// then it is not the first render or the data is already cached&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dismiss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;runCondition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;toastMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;swr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLoadingToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, I added the isLoading to the return so we don't need to call the &lt;code&gt;useLoadingToast&lt;/code&gt; hooks anymore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pokemonData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useWithToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSWR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PokemonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome, it's looking good and clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still override the toast messages just like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight tsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pokemonData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useWithToast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useSWR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PokemonList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Override Loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this can add to your pattern collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at the demo source code on &lt;a href="https://github.com/theodorusclarence/react-async-pattern"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, but keep in mind there is additional promise to delay the loading time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do you have "passion" for coding?</title>
      <author>Lamy Fafa</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just had to make a rant about this, because I am so utterly tired of employers talking about passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's like it's a special thing in this industry, that developers are supposed to have all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the subtle expectatation that you will work overtime whenever they want, that you are so interested in coding that you just wanna work 12 hours a day. And when you get off work&lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FunwithGirlsatNight/dubai-call-girls-number-0529557133-jumairah-dubai-call-girls"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; you wanna code some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also the worst excuse in the world for an employer to implant an sick mentality in the minds of their employees&lt;a href="https://www.cybo.com/US-biz/dubai-call-girls-service-call-girls"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; making them feel coeerced to not going home when their shift is technically over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I hear one more potential employer asking me if I'm passionate at a job interview I might throw up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I'm passionate, passionate enough to come in when I need to work and to leave when my shift is over. And hey once in a while if you ask nicely and it's really needed I might do some overtime. That's the extent of my passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once had an employer (for a job I turned down) tell me that he was looking for someone with passion&lt;a href="https://www.cybo.com/AE-biz/dubai-call-girls"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; he elaborated on what that meant. It meant someone who didn't just leave when their shift is over (basically guilt tripping me in advance if I didn't wanna work more than my contract says).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are you a passionate developer? Or are you tired of being expected to be "passionate"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm tired of people talking about passion in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming self-employed: A personal journey and best-practices for making the leap</title>
      <author>Max Ritter</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 10:55:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/maxritter/becoming-self-employed-a-personal-journey-and-best-practices-for-making-the-leap-1phm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/maxritter/becoming-self-employed-a-personal-journey-and-best-practices-for-making-the-leap-1phm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2021, I decided to leap the hurdle and start into the &lt;strong&gt;yet-unknown world of becoming self-employed as an IT Freelancer&lt;/strong&gt;. I've already gained experienced what it means to be an entrepreneur and co-founder of a successful startup before (read my other post &lt;a href="https://dev.to/maxritter/why-i-quit-my-job-as-a-co-founder-of-a-successful-startup-and-what-to-learn-from-it-about-success-and-happiness-3d8j"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but this was &lt;strong&gt;something completely new to me&lt;/strong&gt; so you can never be sure whether you do the right or wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward four months into the present, I can say that at least for me, &lt;strong&gt;the decision was absolutely right&lt;/strong&gt;. I am now able to control my time much better than at any moment before in my working life and at the same time have been able to increase my income significantly. There is also a big benefit in the possibility to &lt;strong&gt;be in full control over with whom you work and for how long you stay in one project&lt;/strong&gt;. In the end, you only have to defend those decision in front of your moneybag, creating enough value for the clients so that you can have a &lt;strong&gt;fullfilled living out of that&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I know some people in my network are also thinking about &lt;strong&gt;moving from being employed by a corporate or startup to working independently as a freelancer,&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to share some of the &lt;strong&gt;experiences and best-practices I learned in the first months&lt;/strong&gt;. Those apply to the German market, but I assume things work similarly in other countries of the European Union. &lt;strong&gt;Let me answer the most common and pressuring questions you might have before launching into the unknown world of being self-employed&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-skills-do-i-need-before-starting-a-career-as-a-freelancer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What skills do I need before starting a career as a freelancer?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a tough one and highly depends on the sector where you want to become self-employed in. I started my career in the domain of &lt;strong&gt;Cloud and DevOps&lt;/strong&gt;, where I was able to gain valuable knowledge before by co-fouding a startup and also by working for diverse clients as a consultant afterwards. In addition to that, I have &lt;strong&gt;invested a lot of time and money into &lt;a href="https://www.credly.com/users/maximilian-ritter/badges"&gt;certifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for my special field of expertise, proving customers that I have the expertise that they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it's about &lt;strong&gt;feeling confident with what you offer towards your clients&lt;/strong&gt;, but that does not mean you have to be an absolute expert with ten years of experience in that. Having an open mind towards understanding that becoming professional in any job is a &lt;strong&gt;continous journey of self-learning and self-improvement&lt;/strong&gt;,  is much more important than knowing everything (which is not even possible in our fast-paced world where technology evolves daily). It's also tremendously easier to be excellent in &lt;strong&gt;something that you have a passion for&lt;/strong&gt;, than trying to sell a version of yourself that does not represent your character and skills.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#am-i-already-good-enough-or-should-i-continue-working-for-an-employee-to-gain-more-knowledge"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Am I already good enough or should I continue working for an employee to gain more knowledge?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not advice to jump into becoming a freelancer directly after university, except for bridging some time before another job starts while gaining work experience in the meantime and earning money. In my oppinion, it's &lt;strong&gt;much better to gain sufficient careeer capital first and cash that in&lt;/strong&gt;, as I was explaining in &lt;a href="https://dev.to/maxritter/follow-your-passion-is-this-really-a-good-career-advice-2f3o"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that any career decision is &lt;strong&gt;not a one-way street&lt;/strong&gt;, so even if you felt you made the "wrong decision" afterwards, you learned something out of it about yourself for the future. For me, a course of life is not a straight line, but trying what interests you and finding out if that matches your passion and imgation of how a good life looks like. That means that &lt;strong&gt;sometimes you need to decide against advices from your environment&lt;/strong&gt;, which might tell you to follow the "ordinary path" of leveling up in a corporate or not risking your well-paid job for the adventure of freelancing.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-i-need-to-get-started-as-a-freelancer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do I need to get started as a freelancer?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;strong&gt;couple of prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt; that help to get projects faster, because they make you look professional. On the other hand, there is the unpopular topic of &lt;strong&gt;law and taxes&lt;/strong&gt;, which you also have to take care of when being self-employed. Those are the things I setup when starting my career in this field:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a &lt;strong&gt;professional looking website&lt;/strong&gt; that embodies the services you want to sell to the clients later and your skills and experiences. Reserve a domain and either build the website by yourself if you are a frontend / fullstack developer or use a website builder like &lt;a href="https://carrd.co/"&gt;Carrd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.stackbit.com"&gt;Stackbit&lt;/a&gt;. I used Carrd for &lt;a href="https://www.maxritter.net"&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; and was able to build the result in 3-4 hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a &lt;strong&gt;professional liability&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially larger clients require you to have one, but it's a good practice in general to &lt;strong&gt;cover you from any mistakes that you might make and that can cost a lot of money&lt;/strong&gt;. I would recommend to set the insurance amount to at least one million euro, as this can go quickly if you are responsible for a nasty bug in a production system. You can use the &lt;a href="https://www.check24.de/versicherungen/lexikon/berufshaftpflichtversicherung/"&gt;Check24&lt;/a&gt; comparison service to find a suitable insurance company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for a &lt;strong&gt;professional accountant&lt;/strong&gt; from the beginning on, in case you do not already have one or your family has. I skipped this step and went through the &lt;a href="https://kontist.com/posts/selbststaendig-werden-tipps/"&gt;whole paperwork&lt;/a&gt; for getting registered as a Freelancer myself. Retrospectively, I would not do that again and &lt;strong&gt;directly start with an accountant as sparing partner from day one&lt;/strong&gt;. Go with him or her through the registration process as Freelancer towards the finance authority, so that you have your tax id and VAT id ready when the first projects become more concrete. I used the &lt;a href="https://www.accountable.de/steuerberater/"&gt;Accountable&lt;/a&gt; matching platform to find one, but you can also look for accountants in your local area. Thanks to Corona, it's &lt;strong&gt;not a prerequisite anymore that the accountant is anywhere close to you&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.hartlich-steuerberatung.de/"&gt;Mine&lt;/a&gt; is located 2 hours away from me, and we never saw each other in person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;strong&gt;professional photos&lt;/strong&gt; for your website, LinkedIn and CV. Most IT Freelancers might not enjoy this, but it's super important to have a good first impression towards clients. A good photographer will cost you some money, as the shooting will catch you in different positions and take 1-2 hours. See this as a &lt;strong&gt;one-time investment into your start and do not try to save money here&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are located in the Munich area, I can highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.foto-mw.de/business-portraits.html"&gt;Matthias Wegner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a &lt;strong&gt;separate banking account&lt;/strong&gt;. This is important because it will help you to build reserve assets for the personal income tax and also make the cooperation with your tax accountant easier. My recommendation in this space is &lt;a href="https://kontist.com/"&gt;Kontist&lt;/a&gt;, as it was build towards freelancers and has &lt;strong&gt;smart features that help you to simplify your accounting a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. The premium version that for example has automated income tax calculation costs you 9€ per month, which is well invested money for me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide whether you want to be in the &lt;strong&gt;public or private insurance&lt;/strong&gt;. I decided to go for private as it offers much better features and at the same time is cheaper for me for the amount of money I am making. But this highly depends also on the fact whether you want to get children and married later on and which provider you choose. &lt;strong&gt;There are cheap private insurances that might cost you a ton more later when you are retired, so pick one carefully&lt;/strong&gt;. I chose ottonova and are very happy with their services in the "First Class" tier. They also provide a &lt;a href="https://www.ottonova.de/spar-rechner"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; where you can compare their monthly rates to being in the public insurance. If you go private, set your patients contribution rate to a low number (10%) and definitely choose to insure a sick pay from day 43 onwards (100€ / day is a good value)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide how you will &lt;strong&gt;save money for your retirement&lt;/strong&gt;. As a freelancer in Germany, you do not have to be part of the public pension system and while it's sad to say so due to community reasons, I would not advocate to be part of it. What I can recommend is &lt;a href="https://www.mypension.de/"&gt;myPension&lt;/a&gt;, a company that let's you build &lt;strong&gt;a global diversified ETF based portfolio in a tax-advantaged way&lt;/strong&gt;. You can change or pause your monthly rates whenever you want and also cancel it immediately in case you need the money instantly, which is a flexibility not pausible at traditional providers. MyPension has &lt;a href="https://www.mypension.de/tools/rentenlueckenrechner"&gt;good tools&lt;/a&gt; that help you &lt;strong&gt;determining how much you need to save per month to have a relaxed pension later on&lt;/strong&gt;. In the last year, I made a rate of return of 16% there, which I think is quite nice for such a service. The profits are automatically re-invested so they are tax-free until you cash them out during retirement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independ from being a freelancer, having an &lt;strong&gt;own-occupation disability&lt;/strong&gt; insurance is something I consider to be of high value. You never know what will happen to your work performance in the next decades and that does not have to be on the physical side. &lt;strong&gt;Modern jobs can be stressful and demand a high mental load&lt;/strong&gt;, so mental illnesses are becoming more and more dominant. Protect yourself from this worry and setup an insurance that at least covers your most basic costs of living (for me this is 2000€ amount insured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  How do I find projects and clients?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly helps if you already have a network of decision makers that know how you work and want to work together with you as a freelancer. But it's definitely not a must and you can basically &lt;strong&gt;start from zero and start building your network from there&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a couple of platforms that help to find projects in the German area. By being registered on those platforms and not taking any active role like reaching out to the contact person, I am &lt;strong&gt;getting on average 10 messages or calls per day for positions in my area of expertise&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are the sites I am using: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freelancermap.de/"&gt;freelancermap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Probably the biggest one, if you only want to pick one platform go for this one. When I started in August, I arranged all of my get-to-know meetings there and one of those lead to the assignment that I am currently still into&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.talent.io/"&gt;talent.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to have someone who matches you to projects based on your interest and availability, this could be for you. There is a get to know call with your personal talent advocate, in which you can articulate what you are looking for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gulp.de/"&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Similar to freelancermap in the way it works. If you signup you will also get emails regulary with job offers that match the criteries of your desired project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.malt.de/"&gt;Malt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: It certainly does not hurt to be listed there, as a lot of companies use it to search for candidates. I did not have any interesting opportunities coming out of it, but it's free so don't hesitate to create a profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Although the job search engine is not really focused on Freelancers yet, from time to time there are also offers that you can take when self-employed. Another strategy is to just apply on fulltime position that match your skills and desires and add that you are working as Freelancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely when using those platforms (except for LinkedIn), there is a &lt;strong&gt;recruiting company between you and the real client&lt;/strong&gt;. They often charge an hourly rate that is put on top of your own hourly salary, so their services are basically free for you and have to be paid by the client. However, the client in the end sees the final rate and that means that your hourly rate can be lower, if there is a maximum limit for the position. From my experience, the hourly range of their services is between 10-20€ per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning &lt;strong&gt;project length&lt;/strong&gt;, my personal preference is to have &lt;strong&gt;one client for a couple of months&lt;/strong&gt; instead of having multiple small ones that only last a couple of days or working for several clients in parallel. &lt;strong&gt;Every project involves some paperwork and additional time spend on it that you can't directly charge to the client&lt;/strong&gt;, for example interviews, account setup, etc. If you work for one client only you &lt;strong&gt;have a better focus&lt;/strong&gt; and there is a smaller risk of overworking during stressful periods of the year, when multiple clients would expect you to finish a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember changing the project after a couple of months in order not to risk being treated as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lexoffice.de/lexikon/scheinselbstaendigkeit"&gt;Scheinselbstständig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by the government authorities. There are a some influential factors on this topic like &lt;strong&gt;the way you work for the client&lt;/strong&gt; (are you subject to directives? can you plan your vacations freely?) and &lt;strong&gt;how you represent your services to the outer world&lt;/strong&gt; (via a website or social media profiles). It's good to talk about this topic with your professional accountant, as he/she can give you valuable tips what to do and what to avoid. In case you have a recruiting company between yourself and the client, they also take care to avoid the topic of Scheinselbstständigkeit by &lt;strong&gt;setting up contracts and legal frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that it is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-hourly-or-daily-rate-that-i-should-demand-in-the-beginning-and-later-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the hourly or daily rate that I should demand in the beginning and later on?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That varies on the domain you are working in and the work related expertise that you bring to the project and client. I would advice to &lt;strong&gt;search for salary surveys or studies&lt;/strong&gt; to get a profound idea what you can ask for, then look confident while representing that number in interviews. In my area of AWS cloud development, there is &lt;a href="https://www.jeffersonfrank.com/de/insights/aws-market-trends-salary-survey"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; that shows a range of 80-125€ is common for such freelancer positions in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are asked for a project that does not look like the perfect fit and therefore you don't bother losing it, you can try to &lt;strong&gt;negotiate to be on the upper range of the hourly salary rate&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if it does not work out at the end, you will strenghten your negotation skills which is a needed expertise, as freelancing is basically selling yourself in the best way possible. If you really want to get the project, put yourself in the middle of the range, especially if this is your first job. &lt;strong&gt;You can always raise your hourly rates in the projects to come&lt;/strong&gt; and I would recommend doing so to counterweight at least the current inflation rate of ~5%.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-much-can-i-earn-per-month-and-what-will-i-have-left-over-at-the-end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How much can I earn per month and what will I have left over at the end?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depends on my factors, but I can give you a standard calculation here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say you are working on an &lt;strong&gt;hourly rate of 100€, giving you a daily rate of 800€&lt;/strong&gt;. As you also want to have some spare time for professional training, certifications, networking and side-projects, you are working only 35 hours per week for clients. The downside of being self-employed is &lt;strong&gt;that public holidays (~12 / year), vacations (~ 30 / year) and sick days (~ 5 / year) are unpaid&lt;/strong&gt;, so you have to calculate for those as well, substracting around 4 days per month from your working days. On the gross income side, that leaves you with 108 payable hours times 100€ per hour, giving you a &lt;strong&gt;monthly paycheck of around 10800€&lt;/strong&gt; from the client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds like a lot, but the biggest position that goes away from that number are &lt;strong&gt;personal income taxes&lt;/strong&gt;. You can use &lt;a href="https://kontist.com/taxator/"&gt;Taxator&lt;/a&gt; to calculate how much that is for your circumstances. The "normal" range for an IT Freelancer would be 35-40% when not being married and having no children, so let's assume a value of 37% here. When you use a &lt;strong&gt;service like Kontist, it automatically calculates the amount you need to save for the taxation office&lt;/strong&gt; for every payment you receive from the client (both personal income taxes and VAT, the latter is a transit item), so you only transfer the remaining amount to your private bank account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you do &lt;strong&gt;not have to pay taxes on your whole income, but only the actual profit&lt;/strong&gt;. That means that you can &lt;strong&gt;deduct a &lt;a href="https://steuererklaerung.de/ratgeber-steuern/selbststaendig-freiberufler-was-kann-von-steuer-abgesetzt-werden/"&gt;lot of expenses&lt;/a&gt; that are related to your work as freelancer from the gross income&lt;/strong&gt;, before actually applying the income tax to it. Some costs that I offset on a monthly basis against the taxes are: &lt;strong&gt;leasing rate for my car, insurances,  fuel costs, any electrical devices (laptop, monitor, smartphone), internet and cell phone contract, software, licenses, website, literature, certification, conferences&lt;/strong&gt;. A good tax professional can certainly make up the money you pay for him/her in the way that those expenses can be offseted. As a lot of those costs like electrical devices are variable, let's assume 500€ per month for now. That means you have to &lt;strong&gt;pay income taxes on 10300€ with a percentage of 37%, resulting in 3811€, leaving you with 6989€&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remaining positions, let's use values that I have to pay by myself. Those &lt;strong&gt;might be different for your scenario&lt;/strong&gt;, as I am working completely remotely for clients from my home office and therefore do not have to pay anything for travel or a coworking space. However, let's use those numbers for now to get a &lt;strong&gt;rough estimation of additional costs that you might cover as a freelancer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Retirement Planning&lt;/strong&gt; (myPension): 1000€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Health Insurance&lt;/strong&gt; (ottonova): 580€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tax Accountant&lt;/strong&gt;: 178€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Professional Liability Insurance&lt;/strong&gt; (VHV Allgemeine Versicherung): 32€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Advanced training, certifications, website, conferences&lt;/strong&gt; (Lumped sum, might fluctuate over months): 100€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not putting the costs of a own-occupation disability insurance here, as this is something that also an employee should have. Substracting all those numbers, we are arriving at a &lt;strong&gt;net income of 5100€&lt;/strong&gt;. And this I would say is based on a &lt;strong&gt;very comfortable lifestyle with 35 hours of working&lt;/strong&gt; and a lot of free days, a decent retirement planning and a first class private insurance. If you &lt;strong&gt;want to priotize making money instead&lt;/strong&gt;, you could work for 40 hours a week, negotiate a higher hourly rate of 125€, not take public holidays and cut your vacation days to 20. This would lead you to a &lt;strong&gt;net income of almost double: 9110€&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having made the &lt;strong&gt;experience of overworking&lt;/strong&gt; before, my priority in life is not that anymore, so I feel more than comfortable with a &lt;strong&gt;four-day workweek, enough time for self-education, sports, family/friends and leisure/holidays&lt;/strong&gt; instead. Relaxation is as important as the ability to work focused. Beeing a good freelancer is not a sprint but a marathon, which hopefully brings you closer to important goals in life like being &lt;strong&gt;financially independent, having control over your time and becoming good and confident in what you offer professionally&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope this article was helpful for you in deciding whether you &lt;strong&gt;want to try out becoming self-employed&lt;/strong&gt; in the future and which steps to take when doing so. This path may not be for everyone, as it demands a certain level of &lt;strong&gt;self-motivation, professionality and the ability to use your time efficiently&lt;/strong&gt;. But what you can gain is a lot and I am very happy that I have started my journey of becoming an IT Freelancer five months ago. &lt;strong&gt;If you want to know more about my services&lt;/strong&gt;, have a look at my &lt;a href="https://maxritter.net/"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;let me know in the comments&lt;/strong&gt; what you think about that topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning to code at 33: is it possible to get a junior position without prior experience in the industry?</title>
      <author>Lamy Fafa</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/lamy_fafa_f3cc85ee84f4cd6/learning-to-code-at-33-is-it-possible-to-get-a-junior-position-without-prior-experience-in-the-industry-420b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone! Hope you are all doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a legal translator and a certified English teacher. Zero experience with coding, programming, developing, etc. I just turned 33. I left my home country (Argentina) and I am living in Italy with my wife. This is a big change for us, and I think that right now is be the best moment to start something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I would like to know if you think that, after taking some months in order to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it would be possible for me to get a job in a company. Ultra junior position&lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/539326067/Dubai-Call-Girls-Service-0529501107-Bur-Dubai-Call-Girls"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; if that exists lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the Responsive Web Design course offered by FreeCodeCamp and I am having a blast. I am also watching some LinkedIn courses about HTML and I am slowly reading the Foundations unit of The Odin Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am willing to put the time in order to learn and practice. Slowly and steady. But I feel a little bit intimidated because of my age... I know that "better late than never", right? But I have my feet on the ground as well and I know that, in some industries, getting a junior position in your mid-thirties is almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to read your opinions. I would appreciate any tips&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/694542"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; recommendations, etc. You can DM me if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much and I hope you all have an excellent weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When user enters above input, the code should check the stock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If quantity is less than stock and item is available display a notification message showing
Output Line1 [prices] INR
Calculate total price in float with precision.
Output Line2 quantity LEFT
// updated stock for item after after purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.If the quantity and stocks less than quantity entered by the user while placing order, then display message&lt;br&gt;
Output Line1 NO STOCK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Output Line2 quantity LEFT&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.If user enter character as input for item number and quantity or enter item number which is not available then display following message and stop Output Line1- INVALID INPUT Make sure the string message displayed in output.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create Custom Slug using Title in Laravel</title>
      <author>Marcos Gad</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 10:19:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/marcosgad/how-to-create-custom-slug-using-title-in-laravel-4dh3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/marcosgad/how-to-create-custom-slug-using-title-in-laravel-4dh3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's get started quickly and create a Slug with today's date&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Hello Word'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'-'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Carbon\Carbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'m-d-Y'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//hello-word-11-13-2021&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's see how to use it better&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'title'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'body'&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'published_at'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'-'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Carbon\Carbon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;published_at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'m-d-Y'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy weekend, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...Or at least I would have been if I had my Internet back. This objectively definitely has been the most unproductive week for me, because of things that were out of my control. Not having Internet is a &lt;em&gt;HUGE impediment&lt;/em&gt; for a modern developer who relies a lot on Google searches, Stack Overflow solutions, online resources, and anything else that has to do with data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to do whatever I could to remain productive, but it's really hard to not lose my momentum when I'm thrown off by this. Typically, I navigate through my daily life expecting everything to be structured and routinized. I'm pretty bad at responding to unusual things that seem to come out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PIJpt2bp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rnqxxsedgp7by1zn5x28.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PIJpt2bp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rnqxxsedgp7by1zn5x28.png" alt="No Internet Meme" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, thank you all for the continued support and the encouraging words I received from some of you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to my wife and editor, May for editing images and posting the blog on my behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm not going to skip my retrospective, so let's move on to my daily report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekly-sprint-goals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekly Sprint Goals
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build my company website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued to learn Next.js.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go through the Typescript documentation at least 30 minutes each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekly-review"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekly Review
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, oh... here are the things I've done this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company homepage is not even halfway done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a small portion of the services page until I remembered that I should aim for a single page MVP first and foremost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned and reviewed Next.js a bit here and there (mostly about &lt;code&gt;react-css-modules&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read through the first four chapters of the Typescript Handbook (until &lt;strong&gt;Object Types&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started learning about how to use Amazon SES and Lambda to implement an e-mail contact form for my website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;studied Scrum for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue to network and expand my connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still made some progress, but this is definitely unfocused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#weekly-retrospective"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Weekly Retrospective
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-went-great"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What Went Great
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was consistent with studying Next.js and Typescript for the most part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued to review Scrum, even if it wasn't the main focus for this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got some sections of the homepage have a finished skeleton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made some progress with learning how to implement an email contact form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reached out to multiple people on different platforms, but without getting too distracted by social media (finally, I can live without checking the bell icon too much).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#some-mistakes-ive-made"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Some Mistakes I've Made
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started a lot of things, but finished almost nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the lack of focus is really bad and goes against Scrum principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because there is no such a thing as partially done, I may as well have done nothing. At least, Scrum says so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also forgot about my "I blogged for 30 days straight" retrospective post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AGAIN, forgot to install a website blocker to stop myself from checking off-topic content (subconsciously, I could be avoiding this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#things-i-could-improve-on"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Things I Could Improve On
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have some backup in case I have outage, that way I don't lose too much productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;just focus on one thing at a time, and switching around too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stop procrastinating writing literally anything I'm planning on writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should DEFINITELY install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you once again, everyone! Have a great weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
