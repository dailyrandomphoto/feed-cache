      <title>GraphQL is not meant to be exposed over the internet</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/growthatwundergraph/graphql-is-not-meant-to-be-exposed-over-the-internet-3kel</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World! My name is S and I am the head of growth here at &lt;a href="//www.wundergraph.com"&gt;Wundergraph&lt;/a&gt;. The article was written by our CEO / CTO Jens Neuse. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is currently one of the most frequently mentioned technologies when it comes to innovation in the API economy. Adopters enjoy the ease of use and tooling like for example GraphiQL, the browser-based user interface to try out any GraphQL API. The whole experience of GraphQL is exactly what frontend-developers need to build amazing interactive web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with the rise of adoption, I’m starting to get more and more concerned about the way people understand GraphQL and use it. In this post, I’d like to share my unpopular opinion on what GraphQL really is meant to be and why you should be concerned if you’re using it the popular-but-risky way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#api-styles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  API styles
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a step back and discuss APIs and API styles in general before answering the main question of why you’re probably using GraphQL the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APIs offer a way to hide the complexity of the implementation behind a user-friendly interface. For example, a shopping basket can have methods to add and delete items or to move forward to the checkout. As a user of this shopping cart API, you don’t have to think about how the data gets stored or what exactly happens when you add or remove an item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades various styles of APIs have emerged, all with different implementations, depending on the use cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-probably-dont-need-graphql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You probably don’t need GraphQL
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to choose the right API style for a problem, you also have to consider how the API gets published and used. Do you know all your users and use cases? Are these users part of your own organization? Are they partners? The answers will most probably influence your choice of the API style and implementation, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last sentence is where I think we get it wrong a lot of the time. I see people all over the place choose the API style and implementation long before the important questions were answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-you-have-facebook-scale-problems"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do you have Facebook scale Problems?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current most popular example of this behavior is GraphQL. Are you building a modern single page application with React? Awesome, use GraphQL! Facebook, Airbnb, Paypal, Netflix, they all do it so it must be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don’t we see more discussions around choosing the right technology for a given problem? I assume it’s a lack of education, but I’m not sure on this one. If you have any relevant degree, you might respond to this with your experience of education on APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always keep in mind, if you use Facebook-scale tooling without having a Facebook-scale organization and Facebook-scale problems, you might realize painfully that you’re using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It’s the same reason why chaos monkey makes sense for Netflix while it doesn’t for your two docker containers running on a 5$ machine on digital ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-is-graphql-getting-so-popular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why is GraphQL getting so popular?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL simplifies the communication between API developer and API consumer. API consumers, often frontend developers, get lots of change requests from product owners which lead to changing requirements on the API. With GraphQL, you have a good chance of not being forced to talk to the developer of the API. You change the Query and can get back to CSS and Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume this was one of the main drivers at GitHub to choose GraphQL as an implementation of the query-based API style for their new API. Their API is publicly available. They have big numbers of API consumers, all with different requirements. They can’t build resource-based APIs that satisfy all of their users. In this particular use-case, GraphQL might actually be a good choice. Instead of trying to solve each problem, they rather offer a generic GraphQL API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#youre-probably-not-github-are-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You’re probably not GitHub, are you?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the trade-offs that GitHub is willing to accept when publicly exposing a GraphQL API? They have a whole team behind their GraphQL API, making sure you, the user, does not accidentally or intentionally break their systems. You can watch videos of them talking at conferences about the complex systems they built to secure their API and keep it stable. They’ve built tooling for GraphQL specific analytics to get better insights into API usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-you-fully-understand-the-risks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do you fully understand the risks?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that many developers with a focus outside of security have little experience on what it takes to secure a REST API exposed on the internet. Most of us have little experience implementing authentication, authorization, rate limiting etc. . However, I think securing a RESTful API is rather simple, compared to a GraphQL API. Any HTTP-based API framework lets you define your routes and attach standardized middlewares to solve the problems listed above. A single HTTP call always corresponds to a single call on the controller of an API. With GraphQL on the other hand, a single Query might result in thousands of calls on the controllers (resolvers) of the API. There is no simple way to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the language you use, various libraries are trying to help you with the issue. How trustful are these libraries? Do you fully understand how they work? Are there edge cases we’re not yet fully aware of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#will-you-benefit-as-much-as-github-does"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Will you benefit as much as GitHub does?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a single developer working on a side project? Do you benefit as much as you’re expecting from using GraphQL? Are you using many different clients with different data needs? Do you really need a query-based API? What’s your strategy to combat the problems listed above?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-im-not-exposing-my-graphql-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But I’m not exposing my GraphQL API
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking that your GraphQL API is not really exposed. It’s used on your website, but you don’t show the playground anywhere. If you’re using a GraphQL client in the frontend that directly talks to your GraphQL API, this API is exposed, even if not visually exposed with a GraphQL playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#am-i-leaking-sensitive-information"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Am I leaking sensitive information?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you allow any client to invoke the introspection Query? Are you leaking sensitive information through the introspection Query? Are you planning a new feature on the UI which will be made public in a few weeks or months? Is this feature already visible to your competition if they look at your schema? What if someone scrapes your schema every day to track changes and try attacks whenever you update your schema?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#schema-traversal-attacks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Schema traversal attacks
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you aware of schema traversal attacks? A user might be allowed to see his own account balance, but how about his/her friends? Is it possible to traverse the schema in a way you didn’t anticipate which leaks data? How do you test for this kind of behavior and ensure it’s not possible for your own schema?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bug-bounties-everywhere"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bug bounties everywhere
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a reason why companies like Shopify participate in bug bounty programs? They seem to be aware of the complexity of securing a GraphQL API. They invite security experts to help them make their publicly available GraphQL API more secure. Do you realize that your GraphQL API is as vulnerable as Shopify’s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-most-secure-graphql-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The most secure GraphQL server
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to make a system 100% secure to any kind of remote attack? If you want to be 100% safe, you should consider unplugging the network cable. However, this comes with some inconvenient drawbacks. You probably don’t want to store your GraphQL query on a USB dongle, walk to the remote computer and execute it manually, then copy the response back on the dongle and walk back to your own computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s in between an unplugged network cable and exposing GraphQL? How about reducing the complexity to the level of a REST or RPC-based API while keeping the advantages of a query-based API?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#graphql-as-a-serverside-language"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GraphQL as a server-side language
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we primarily use GraphQL on the server to define JSON-RPC APIs, we get the best of both worlds. The flexibility of GraphQL combined with the security and predictable performance of an RPC-based API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-graphql-specification-is-designed-for-this"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The GraphQL specification is designed for this
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GraphQL spec allows us to define multiple Operations (Queries, Mutations, Subscriptions) in a single GraphQL document. In addition to this, the validation rules of the spec require all Operations in a GraphQL document to be named. There’s just one exception which allows a single anonymous Query. But in case the number of operations in a document are above 1 we’re already forced to name our Operations. Another important requirement is that all Operation names must be unique. That is, there shall be no two Operations with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-set-of-graphql-operations-is-a-jsonrpc-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A set of GraphQL Operations is a JSON-RPC API
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the GraphQL specification alongside with the validation rules builds a perfect foundation for what we’re trying to achieve here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to define a new JSON-RPC API, all we have to do is create a new file containing a set of GraphQL Operations. Each Operation has a unique name. This name becomes the function name of the JSON-RPC. The Operation variables become the input of the RPC call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we can “deploy” all Operations on our API backend and prepare the RPC Endpoints. Finally, based on the Operations and the known RPC-Endpoints we’re able to generate a client that knows about the schema as well as all RPC endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#jsonrpcgraphql-compared-to-exposed-graphql"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JSON-RPC-GraphQL compared to exposed GraphQL
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: input and outputs are typesafe the attack surface is reduced you know all the Operations a client is using the generated client is very small, compared to a thick GraphQL client, which leads to smaller JS bundle size less bandwidth usage because we’re not sending Operations but just making RPC calls Query Parsing, Normalization &amp;amp; Validation happens at compile-time, not at runtime, making it more secure and performant no exposed GraphQL endpoint and therefore no exposed introspection either graph traversal attacks are impossible as the graph is not exposed anymore you know in advance when a change to the schema or one of the Operations would break a client and can mitigate this JSON-RPC turns any GraphQL Query into a GET request and therefore makes them easily cacheable at the transport layer because Operations are stored on the backend and never exposed to the client, you’re able to put authorization logic into the Operations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: you can no longer use your favorite GraphQL client you have to run a code generator whenever you update the Schema or any of the Operations you need to compile and store all Operations on the API backend this approach does only work when the API user is allowed to prepare and store Operations on the API backend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using GraphQL as a framework for building JSON-RPC APIs is not a solution to every problem. There are situations where it’s not feasible or simply technically impossible. However, a lot of GraphQL users can benefit from this approach, as it increases security and performance at marginal costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-implementing-this-approach-your-business"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is implementing this approach your business?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of you, the answer to this question will probably be “no”. At &lt;a href="//www.wundergraph.com"&gt;Wundergraph&lt;/a&gt;, our goal is to make APIs easy to use, secure and performant. We’ve already implemented the approach outlined above. If you don’t want to re-invent the wheel, we’d be more than happy to work with you together. We focus on the plumbing so you can solve problems of your own business domain and not waste your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#interested-in-implementing-wundergraph-in-your-business"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Interested in implementing Wundergraph in your business?
&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>The DERN stack, the perfect alternative to MERN stack for Serverless</title>
      <author>Remi W.</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 21:20:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ixartz/the-dern-stack-the-perfect-alternative-to-mern-stack-for-serverless-1edm</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ixartz/the-dern-stack-the-perfect-alternative-to-mern-stack-for-serverless-1edm</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MERN stack&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most famous stacks in the JavaScript ecosystem. A combination of &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node&lt;/strong&gt; to build web applications. Unfortunately, MERN isn't ready for modern application in the Serverless world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uihXRREs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/mern-logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uihXRREs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/mern-logo.png" alt="Mern stack logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-bottleneck-in-the-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A bottleneck in the database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, you can deploy your React application to &lt;strong&gt;modern static hosting services&lt;/strong&gt; like Netlify or Cloudflare pages. These platforms remove the burden to manage servers for your application frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QAgGl0bV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/cloudflare-page-logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QAgGl0bV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/cloudflare-page-logo.png" alt="Cloudflare pages hosting"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same for the backend side, the Serverless community has grown a lot. There is now a lot of tutorial on how to write an &lt;strong&gt;Express.js backend on AWS Lambda&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have already written the Express.js code, you can easily convert to Serverless without any issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tLUpU0Kf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/serverless-framework-logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tLUpU0Kf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/serverless-framework-logo.png" title="Serverless framework AWS lambda"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7dEgbYjc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/express-js-logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7dEgbYjc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/express-js-logo.png" title="Express js serverless"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what's wrong with the MERN stack for Serverless? &lt;strong&gt;The database&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements-for-a-serverless-database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements for a Serverless Database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Serverless Database should work like the Serverless function. It needs to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Easy to use&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Easy to configure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pay-as-you-go pricing&lt;/strong&gt;, only charged for what you use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scalable&lt;/strong&gt;, can handle the request based on your usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scale to Zero&lt;/strong&gt;, no cost when there is no request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Managed service&lt;/strong&gt;, no maintenance in scaling and update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most used databases in the JS community are &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt;. But, none of them is Serverless for the production environment. There is some solution like AWS Aurora Serverless but there are several limitations and doesn't meet all the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dern-at-the-rescue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DERN at the rescue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to &lt;strong&gt;replace MongoDB with DynamoDB&lt;/strong&gt; in your MERN stack. So, now it becomes &lt;strong&gt;DERN&lt;/strong&gt;. DynamoDB is a true Serverless database: managed, highly scalable and scales to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jr-N9Mtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/dern-stack-logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jr-N9Mtj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/dern-stack-logo.png" alt="Dern stack logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DynamoDB gives access to more interesting features that you can enable if you are interested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Continuous backups&lt;/strong&gt;, with Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Global tables&lt;/strong&gt;, make your database close to your users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Streaming applications&lt;/strong&gt;, you can capture every changes in your table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the drawbacks I see with DynamoDB is the vendor lock-in to AWS. If you follow best practices, you shouldn't have any issue switching databases to a different cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS is at the head of the Serverless race, AWS Lambda is more performant and provides more features when comparing to its competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are building a Serverless application for production, you have a high chance to use already AWS ecosystem. Integrating DynamoDB into your stack shouldn't be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dern-stack-in-action"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  DERN stack in action
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently launched my first SaaS product with a &lt;strong&gt;DERN stack, 100% serverless&lt;/strong&gt; from backend to frontend. Definitively, it makes my developer life so much easier with &lt;strong&gt;no server management&lt;/strong&gt; and I can now have &lt;strong&gt;a deep sleep&lt;/strong&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://postmage.com"&gt;PostMage&lt;/a&gt; is my first SaaS and it's built using the DERN stack. I've also written a detailed article about &lt;a href="https://creativedesignsguru.com/saas-tech-stack/"&gt;the tech stack as a solo developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 5 months of development to build the first version of PostMage by spending a lot of time choosing the right tech stack, designing the landing page and the dashboard, implementing the authentication and the integration to Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I've built a &lt;a href="https://nextlessjs.com"&gt;Next JS SaaS&lt;/a&gt; Boilerplate Template for you to start a SaaS product and save a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nextlessjs.com"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c1qKLlCI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativedesignsguru.com/assets/images/themes/nextless-react-saas-boilerplate.png" alt="Next JS SaaS Boilerplate Starter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Navigating Complex Objects</title>
      <author>Kenny Fitzgerald (he/him)</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 21:06:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fitzgeraldkd/navigating-complex-objects-4pe7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fitzgeraldkd/navigating-complex-objects-4pe7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you're just starting off in coding, the concept of nested objects and accessing their properties can be difficult to grasp. Seeing a complicated object with multiple levels of depth can be intimidating at first, but working with these kinds of objects is an important skill to develop. When retrieving information from databases and APIs, the results are often packaged in a &lt;strong&gt;JSON&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(JavaScript Object Notation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; object that has many levels of nested objects. Understanding how to navigate these objects will be crucial when working with this kind of data. This post is written for those who are new to working with objects and are looking for a breakdown on how to access a property multiple layers deep in nested objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-sample-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Sample Data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of the examples here, we'll be looking at some real world &lt;em&gt;(and beyond)&lt;/em&gt; data provided by NASA. There are a number of free APIs from NASA that are available for anyone to access, so this will be a good example of what a complex object could look like in a real application. Our sample data will be fetched from the &lt;a href="https://api.nasa.gov/#asteroids-neows"&gt;Asteroids - NeoWs&lt;/a&gt; API which provides information about near-Earth asteroids. Below I have included a simplified &lt;em&gt;JSON schema&lt;/em&gt; of the dataset that shows the organizational structure without the actual data.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"neo_reference_id"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"nasa_jpl_url"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"absolute_magnitude_h"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"estimated_diameter"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"close_approach_data"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"is_sentry_object"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A couple of things to note&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There could be any number of key/value pairs under &lt;code&gt;near_earth_objects&lt;/code&gt;, depending on how many days of data is requested through the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The values associated with each date key are arrays, and these arrays can also contain any number of items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in seeing the actual JSON object, &lt;a href="https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/blog-posts/blob/main/navigating-objects/sample-data.json"&gt;here is the sample data&lt;/a&gt; that I fetched with the API. The examples below will assume that a variable &lt;code&gt;fetchResults&lt;/code&gt; has already been declared and that these results have already been assigned to it. There are two dates included in the results: &lt;code&gt;"2015-09-07"&lt;/code&gt; (with 13 objects), and &lt;code&gt;"2015-09-08"&lt;/code&gt; (with 11 objects).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#accessing-the-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Accessing the Data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we wanted to read the &lt;code&gt;is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid&lt;/code&gt; property of the first element associated with the date &lt;code&gt;"2015-09-07"&lt;/code&gt;. How do we go about doing it? Well we have to navigate down through each level in the object, working our way through the nested objects to find the specific property we're trying to reach. Here's how you can do it in JavaScript:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//           ┌ access the 'near_earth_objects' object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//           │                 ┌ access the array associated with the desired date&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//           │                 │             ┌ acccess the first object in the array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//           │                 │             │   ┌ access the desired property&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;near_earth_objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2015-09-07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All right! So we got the property we were looking for and it returns the expected value of &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, but how does this all work? Let's break this down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;fetchResults&lt;/code&gt; is the object returned from the API request as described above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.near_earth_objects&lt;/code&gt; accesses the object that contains all the dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;['2015-09-07']&lt;/code&gt; accesses the array of objects for the desired date. Note that &lt;strong&gt;bracket notation is required&lt;/strong&gt; here for two reasons:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key starts with a number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key contains a hyphen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;/code&gt; accesses the first object of the array. &lt;strong&gt;Bracket notation is required&lt;/strong&gt; here since we are retrieving an element inside an &lt;strong&gt;array&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a property in an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid&lt;/code&gt; finally gets us to the property we wanted to retrieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can't we just do the following?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well the &lt;code&gt;fetchResults&lt;/code&gt; object only has three keys: &lt;code&gt;links&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;element_count&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;near_earth_objects&lt;/code&gt;. Accessing any other key will return &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; since an object does not have immediate access to the keys in any children objects. The property we're trying to get to is four levels deep in the &lt;code&gt;fetchResults&lt;/code&gt; object, so we have to use &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;property accessors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; four times in order to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note&lt;/em&gt;: Accessing this property can also be done purely with &lt;strong&gt;bracket notation&lt;/strong&gt; as shown below, however I prefer using &lt;strong&gt;dot notation&lt;/strong&gt; where possible for its readability.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;near_earth_objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2015-09-07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#visualizing-the-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Visualizing the Data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're first learning about objects, accessing these nested properties can seem abstract and might be a hard concept to grasp. Another way to visualize this may be to &lt;strong&gt;imagine this object as a folder tree&lt;/strong&gt; on your computer. When you want to access a file, you sometimes have to navigate through &lt;em&gt;multiple levels of directories&lt;/em&gt; first. For each level of arrays/objects nested within the main object, imagine another subfolder with its own contents. When you're in the top level directory, you don't have immediate access to files in any of the sub-directories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of demonstration, I have created a &lt;em&gt;mockup set of folders&lt;/em&gt; to mirror the structure of the &lt;code&gt;fetchResults&lt;/code&gt; object. Below is the output of running the &lt;code&gt;tree&lt;/code&gt; command in the terminal for these directories.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;tree fetchResults
fetchResults

    │   └── ...
    └── ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See how the structure here is nearly identical to the structure of the object? The process of retrieving a file in this folder structure is very similar to that of retrieving a property in the object. In JavaScript you use dot and/or bracket notation to access a property of an object. In Bash or your file explorer you use &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; to access a subfolder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// accessing a property in a series of nested objects&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fetchResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;near_earth_objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2015-09-07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# accessing a file in series of nested folders&lt;/span&gt;
fetchResults/near_earth_objects/2015-09-07/0/is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a more visual example see below for an example of navigating through the mockup folder set up to match the structure of &lt;code&gt;fetchResults&lt;/code&gt;. When you're trying to access a property that is multiple levels deep in an object, imagine that you are navigating a folder structure to get to the information you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FZTsW9DY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/quJB88C.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FZTsW9DY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/quJB88C.gif" alt="Animation demonstrating navigating through nested directories" title="Animation demonstrating navigating through nested directories"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#wrapping-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Wrapping Up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this brief explanation provides some clarity into navigating through nested objects! It may be intimidating at first, but it's an important skill to develop. &lt;strong&gt;Objects with this level of complexity are common&lt;/strong&gt; and they can be structured in countless different ways. When you get data from an API, you may not have much (or any) control on how the data is formatted as you receive it. Being familiar with how to access the different properties will be a big help as you start to work with complex datasets. &lt;em&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Playfair Cipher Encryption Algorithm</title>
      <author>Karan-Munjani</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:37:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/karanmunjani/what-is-playfair-cipher-encryption-algorithm-4npk</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/karanmunjani/what-is-playfair-cipher-encryption-algorithm-4npk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is going to be two or three part series where I'm going to explain the theory behind the Playfair cipher and how we can program it using most probably everyone's favourite language 🥁🥁🥁 (&lt;em&gt;"DRUM ROLLS"&lt;/em&gt;)  &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, Yay!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Playfair cipher or Playfair square or Wheatstone–Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair for promoting its use. - Source: Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we can grasp from above is that, this algorithm was developed by Charles Wheatstone but bears the name as Lord Playfair promoted it. Also we can depict that it was first practical digraph substitution cipher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digraph Cipher&lt;/strong&gt; : It simply means that we encrypt the plaintext to ciphertext with two characters at a time. (Will get more idea as I explain you through.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;center&gt; * * * * * * *&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-playfair-cipher-algorithm"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Playfair Cipher Algorithm
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Algorithm mainly consist of three steps: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a Cipher Key Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the rest of our discussion we will be using below mentioned Key and Plaintext:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Key&lt;/strong&gt; = DevToDiesel&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plaintext&lt;/strong&gt; = Awesome Dev Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's move forward!!&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yx34-l4T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf66y8toak3tmukyvjtp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Yx34-l4T--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf66y8toak3tmukyvjtp.png" alt="Full Mat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step1-convert-plaintext-into-digraphs-ie-into-pair-of-two-letters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step:1 Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our Plaintext &lt;code&gt;Awesome Dev Community&lt;/code&gt; will be&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[AW, ES, OM, ED, EV, CO, MX, MU, NI, TY] 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now You might be wondering why &lt;code&gt;MX&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;MM&lt;/code&gt; and where did the whitespaces go! Because there are three rules to be followed here and those are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.While splitting text into pairs, if the letters are same in a pair then insert filler x. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.At the end if only one letter is left it has no pair we can insert our filler x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Remove Whitespaces from the string as well as special characters apart from 25 alphabets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt; * * * * * * *&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step2-generate-a-cipher-key-matrix"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step:2 Generate a Cipher Key Matrix
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cipher Key Matrix is a 5×5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting the plaintext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the 25 alphabets must be unique and one letter of the alphabet (usually J) is omitted from the table (as the table can hold only 25 alphabets). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the plaintext contains J, then it is replaced by I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you might expected! There are also rules to generate this key matrix. You're getting brainy now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rules:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. If our key has repeating letters omit them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So our Key = "DevToDiesel" Will be&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;D E V T O I E S L
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fill this unique characters key in our 5X5 Matrix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So it might look something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aGHD8Zyq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kgrif2fq5zro15h7ck9x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aGHD8Zyq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kgrif2fq5zro15h7ck9x.png" alt="Half Mat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Fill the remaining places with unused alphabets without J&lt;/strong&gt; As it should only contain 25 letters, only omitting J would result in matrix like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uRGW0ngW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rtui4hbfoieyswnshv0d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uRGW0ngW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rtui4hbfoieyswnshv0d.png" alt="Full Mat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt; * * * * * * *&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-encrypt-plaintext-using-cipher-key-matrix-and-get-ciphertext"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3: Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will encrypt our diagraph plaintext that is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[AW, ES, OM, ED, EV, CO, MX, MU, NI, TY]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;into Cipher text with the help of cipher key matrix, and following below listed rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rule-1"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rule: 1
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both letters are not in same column and not in same row and making a rectangle shape then take letters on the horizontal opposite corner of the rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our first pair from plaintext is "AW", so A will be enciphered to S and W will enciphered to Y.&lt;br&gt;
i.e., &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A -&amp;gt; S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W -&amp;gt; Y
resulting in,&lt;strong&gt;AW -&amp;gt; SY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zcccPbFn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ev1lp2r8v7q5dqmdbnfp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zcccPbFn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ev1lp2r8v7q5dqmdbnfp.png" alt="Rule 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, pair OM will be enciphered to DR.&lt;br&gt;
i.e., &lt;strong&gt;OM -&amp;gt; DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eCLJNxQP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6o1lbkr77y02gugevlye.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eCLJNxQP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6o1lbkr77y02gugevlye.png" alt="Rule 1.2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rule-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rule: 2
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both the letters are in the same column: Take the letter below each one (going back to the top if at the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Our Second pair is "ES", so according to above rule it will be enciphered to its below character in same column.&lt;br&gt;
i.e., &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E -&amp;gt; S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S -&amp;gt; F
thus, &lt;strong&gt;ES -&amp;gt; SF&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QvNKqiDw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/29f3of9b4b48zkir46ym.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QvNKqiDw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/29f3of9b4b48zkir46ym.png" alt="Rule 2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rule-3"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rule: 3
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both the letters are in the same row: Take the letter to the right of each one (going back to the leftmost if at the rightmost position)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The pair DE is in same row, so just choose the right next to each character from cipher key matrix.&lt;br&gt;
i.e., &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D -&amp;gt; E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E -&amp;gt; V
so, &lt;strong&gt;DE -&amp;gt; EV&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wPQHHjEB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z3j5t5cg7esa6m9dbt1f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wPQHHjEB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z3j5t5cg7esa6m9dbt1f.png" alt="Rule 3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt; * * * * * * *&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same way after performing above rules for whole the list of diagraph plain text, our cipher text will be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plaintext&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[AW, ES, OM, ED, EV, CO, MX, MU, NI, TY]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ciphertext&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[SY, SF, DR, VE, VT, KD, PU, UD, MS, AT]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plaintext = &lt;strong&gt;AWESOMEDEVCOMXMUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ciphertext = &lt;strong&gt;SYSFDRVEVTKDPUUDMSAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;center&gt; * * * * * * *&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-the-next-part-of-series-ill-be-showing-how-to-code-playfair-cipher-using-python-so-stay-tuned"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In the next part of series I'll be showing how to code playfair cipher using python, so stay tuned.
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Best VS Code features &amp; Learning Material UI ✏️</title>
      <author>Tuomo Kankaanpää</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 20:37:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tumee/best-vs-code-features-learning-material-ui-2o4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tumee/best-vs-code-features-learning-material-ui-2o4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.tuomokankaanpaa.com/newsletter"&gt;my newsletter&lt;/a&gt; last week. I publish previous week's newsletter here on the blog. If you want to read these as soon as they are published, &lt;a href="https://www.tuomokankaanpaa.com/newsletter"&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; for the newsletter!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahoy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Visual Studio Code as my main code editor. To be honest it is pretty much the only editor I use. There is bunch of great features in VS Code that I use daily. Features that honestly make my life a lot easier and productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I thought that it might be helpful to share those features in case you are not yet using them or leveraging them fully in your own workflow. You can find the features from the latest video on my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa"&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKq5OIhKpzE"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if you just want to know the list, here it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiline editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command palette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-i-learned-this-week"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What I learned this week?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on a Next.js project where I decided to use &lt;a href="https://mui.com/"&gt;Material UI&lt;/a&gt; as a component library. At first it was kind of hard to know and find what components I should use but after a while, I got actually something good looking on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is actually a simple Next.js blog application. I plan on shooting a video about it, teaching how to code one by yourself. I'm not yet sure when I'll be making that video but it might be in the near future so &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/tuomokankaanpaa?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;stay tuned for that&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used Material UI for the past couple of weeks on couple of projects in addition to the Next.js blog application. I am quite excited about Material UI, now that I have a bit better understanding on how the whole thing works and what kind of components should I use for certain situations and what kind of components they actually have!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some time now thought that I need to learn something that I can use to make my apps and UIs look even half decent (I am terrible at designing and styling in general). So I was thinking of learning TailwindCSS next but now that I have worked with Material UI a bit, I'm thinking of giving Material UI a chance and learning that first. Of course they are not / don't do "the same thing" but Material UI serves the need that I have and there is only so much one can be learning simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you used Material UI or TailwindCSS? If you have, let me know what you think about them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for this week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;
Tuomo&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="py"&gt;gone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"!f() { git fetch --all --prune; git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch -D; }; f"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git gone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your git workflow is using Pull Requests that are merged into main branch, after a while your local list of branches will get very messy, because most of the time the PR is merged and remote branch is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However on local you just create a new branch from main for a new feature/fix, and you leave the previous branch behind without deleting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with this, list all local branches with their remotes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-vv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  feature-1 4ea9770 [origin/feature-1] test commit
  feature-2 4ea9770 [origin/feature-2] test commit
  feature-3 4ea9770 [origin/feature-3] test commit
  feature-4 4ea9770 [origin/feature-4] test commit
  feature-5 4ea9770 [origin/feature-5] test commit
  feature-6 4ea9770 [origin/feature-6] test commit
  feature-7 4ea9770 [origin/feature-7] test commit
* main      4ea9770 [origin/main] test commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next we remove some remote branches, fetch remote info, and list branches again&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--prune&lt;/span&gt;
git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-vv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  feature-1 4ea9770 [origin/feature-1: gone] test commit
  feature-2 4ea9770 [origin/feature-2] test commit
  feature-3 4ea9770 [origin/feature-3: gone] test commit
  feature-4 4ea9770 [origin/feature-4] test commit
  feature-5 4ea9770 [origin/feature-5] test commit
  feature-6 4ea9770 [origin/feature-6] test commit
  feature-7 4ea9770 [origin/feature-7: gone] test commit
* main      4ea9770 [origin/main] test commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B_HRKL6_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/g01ZnwAUvutuK8GIQn/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47iu01qeuvc6pgymjyfall0i0soact78iv2udjr3nf%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B_HRKL6_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://media.giphy.com/media/g01ZnwAUvutuK8GIQn/giphy.gif%3Fcid%3Decf05e47iu01qeuvc6pgymjyfall0i0soact78iv2udjr3nf%26rid%3Dgiphy.gif%26ct%3Dg" alt="travolta confused"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see there are some lines that have &lt;code&gt;gone&lt;/code&gt;, that means that the remote branch is gone, so &lt;code&gt;origin/feature-1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;origin/feature-3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;origin/feature-7&lt;/code&gt; remote branches don't exist anymore, but we still have them locally. And with time this list can get very big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get back to our alias. Now that we have this &lt;code&gt;gone&lt;/code&gt; keyword in the branch list, we can hook in and get the branch name and delete it. For example to manually delete &lt;code&gt;feature-7&lt;/code&gt; we would do:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Fetch info for all remotes and prune info of missing remote branches&lt;/span&gt;
git fetch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--prune&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# List all branches to see what is gone&lt;/span&gt;
git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-vv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Delete desired branch&lt;/span&gt;
git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; feature-7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's combine all these 3 into a single one liner 🚀&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--prune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-vv&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class="nb"&gt;awk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'/: gone]/{print $1}'&lt;/span&gt; | xargs git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we use pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) operator to pass output from one command to another pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git fetch --all --prune&lt;/code&gt; just fetches remotes info&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git branch -vv&lt;/code&gt; list branches and pipes output lines to awk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;awk '/: gone]/{print $1}'&lt;/code&gt; find lines with &lt;code&gt;gone&lt;/code&gt;, select first column (which is branch name) and pipe to xargs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;code&gt;xargs git branch -D&lt;/code&gt; takes received branches names and deletes them&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to make this one liner a &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases"&gt;git alias&lt;/a&gt; we put it into a function that will be called 💻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add manually the alias in your &lt;code&gt;~/.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight properties"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# ~/.gitconfig file
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;[alias]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;gone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"!f() { git fetch --all --prune; git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1}' | xargs git branch -D; }; f"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or follow these steps. Usually is a single line, but because of multiple quotes, double quotes and dollar signs we have to do it in multiple steps using a temporary file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the alias code in &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; temporary file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"f() { git fetch --all --prune; git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1}' | xargs git branch -D; }; f"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consume &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; file for git alias command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git config &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--global&lt;/span&gt; alias.gone &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cat alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# remove temporary created file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;rm alias&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's do a full demo 😮‍💨&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-vv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  feature-1 4ea9770 [origin/feature-1] test commit
  feature-2 4ea9770 [origin/feature-2] test commit
  feature-3 4ea9770 [origin/feature-3] test commit
  feature-4 4ea9770 [origin/feature-4] test commit
  feature-5 4ea9770 [origin/feature-5] test commit
  feature-6 4ea9770 [origin/feature-6] test commit
  feature-7 4ea9770 [origin/feature-7] test commit
* main      4ea9770 [origin/main] test commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next I deleted all feature branches on remote. And call &lt;code&gt;git gone&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git gone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fetching origin
From /Users/iamandrewluca/Temp/gone-bare
 - [deleted]         (none)     -&amp;gt; origin/feature-1
 - [deleted]         (none)     -&amp;gt; origin/feature-2
 - [deleted]         (none)     -&amp;gt; origin/feature-3

Deleted branch feature-4 (was 4ea9770).
Deleted branch feature-5 (was 4ea9770).
Deleted branch feature-6 (was 4ea9770).
Deleted branch feature-7 (was 4ea9770).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/Jls16O6RdqyxueMvBj/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/Jls16O6RdqyxueMvBj/giphy.gif" alt="magician focus gone"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like my local repo to always be clear. And in the past I had always to check what branches are deleted on remote and delete them also locally. Now I don't have to remember anything. Just &lt;code&gt;git gone&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you still here? 😊 Thanks for reading my blog posts! 🎉 🎈 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Monetization&lt;/strong&gt; is a web service that allows you to send money directly in your browser. This is a &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; browser API that allows the creation of a &lt;strong&gt;payment stream&lt;/strong&gt; from the user agent to the website.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A framework for crushing big tech interviews</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dannyhabibs/a-framework-for-crushing-big-tech-interviews-32bl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Big Tech programming interviews are about more than just your ability to program, the sooner you recognize that and change the way you prepare, the faster you will get the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-key-pillars-of-a-big-tech-interview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The key pillars of a Big Tech interview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programming questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The random factoid check&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your experience &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-programming-questions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The programming questions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot behind preparing for a whiteboard interview. I’ll write a follow up post that will deep dive on this topic soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some resources to get your started until then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites to use: Hackerrank, Leetcode, Pramp &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books to read: Algorithm Design Manual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-random-factoid-check"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The random factoid check
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes an interviewer will ask you about some random factoid that they are convinced is important to know. Asking questions like this is highly discouraged in big tech, but interviewers still do it. Not handling these correctly can sink your interview all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-conversation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The conversation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Big Tech companies have a dedicated behavioral interview. You’ll also be having conversations with the interviewer before and after your programming sections. You need to show that you are easy to talk to and that you are knowledgable about the direction the industry is heading in. Ideally each interviewer leaves with the impression that you are more plugged into the industry than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#your-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Your experience
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to talk about your experience and make it sound exciting is important. It always comes up and is a great chance to show off and standout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-checklist-framework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Checklist Framework
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure you are preparing for all aspects of your upcoming tech interview you’ll want to make some progress on each pillar every day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend creating a daily checklist and keeping yourself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solve a programming interview question &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn one new factoid about your area&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read one article/document around your focus area&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commit something to github every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solve-a-programming-interview-question"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solve a programming interview question
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again there is a lot behind this topic, but the best place to start is to do at least one programming interview question everyday. There are a ton of websites to help facilitate this and make tracking your progress easy. I’ll post about this in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learn-one-new-factoid-about-your-area"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learn one new factoid about your area
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn one random fact about anything in your “focus area” and keep a running list of them in a readily available document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a system to defend you against the “random factoid” that an interviewer asks about, it also has the added benefit of helping you standout during an interview, you become the one dropping random factoids instead of the interviewer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’ll realize after about a month or two of learning random little facts is that there aren’t that many random facts to learn. If you’ve been learning little facts for a while, and you still don’t know the random factoid that the interviewer asks about, chances are you know a bunch of adjacent facts that you can spew out, showing them you are still knowledgable in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#read-one-articledocument-in-your-focus-area"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Read one article/document in your focus area
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becoming an expert in a specific focus area isn’t as hard as you think and is critically important to impressing an interviewer. If you don’t have one, it’s never too late to pick one. If you don’t care, just start as a language expert(python,js, c++ etc.). By reading one article or tech document a day on your focus area, you will quickly get up to speed with the latest terminology, trends and learn what new features are available. Within a month you’ll be starting to feel like a "python expert”. This will give you great filler talk during the interview and it will allow you to flex little tricks during the programming section of the interview. When you are clearly very knowledgable about a certain vertical, you get more forgiveness for not knowing about other verticals. Ex. You wouldn’t expect a python expert to know much about how browsers work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#commit-something-to-github-everyday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Commit something to Github everyday
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are just updating a readme, commit something to github every day. Filling out those green squares on your profile is more valuable than most people realize. Recruiters and devs will checkout your Github, maybe click through one project that you reference on your resume, and leave with a positive feeling if you seem active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-github-commit-history-from-20162017"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My Github commit history from 2016-2017:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gdp44FR1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf48e7hecfey5y945ua2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gdp44FR1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf48e7hecfey5y945ua2.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you are working on some interesting project you are actually passionate about, this will just make you a more exciting candidate. I plan to write a post soon about what side projects you should/shouldn’t work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#case-study-how-i-got-my-job"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Case Study: How I got my job
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#timeline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Timeline
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 - I got an interview at google with 0 engineering experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 - I tried again, still didn’t get a job at google&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 - I got offers from Facebook + Google + several smaller companies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018 - I taught a course on programming interviews&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I initially got invited to interview with Google in 2015 I didn’t make it through the initial phone screen. I really didn’t know much about programming but I wrote an epic cover letter that got their attention. I studied all of the wrong things between 2015 &amp;amp; 2016, overstudying the wrong topics and understudying the right topics. There wasn’t any structure to my studying, I was just consuming every resource I could and I got denied again at Google in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2016-2017, I realized all of the resources I’d been using had pieces of the puzzle, but none of them provided a high level overview of how to handle the interview. Thats when I created this checklist system. I followed it for about a year and thats what helped me land multiple job offers. I felt like I was completely in control of the programming interview process. Since then, I’ve helped colleagues and friends follow versions of the Checklist Framework tailored to their history, skills, and desired job. After watching multiple people use this framework and get jobs at Amazon, Facebook and Google,  I figured it was worth sharing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My checklist system in my NYC apartment up until I got the job at FB.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QAkrc8ND--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g6at83665rvhsbg23r9v.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QAkrc8ND--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g6at83665rvhsbg23r9v.jpeg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working with parallel branches in Git</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/tuanthanh2067/working-with-parallel-branches-in-git-5jd</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, my name is Dustin, today I want to write a blog about my progress of working with branches in Git. So this is the lab 03, which I have to create 2 parallel branches to work on different aspects of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-progress"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The progress
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I needed to decide what to add to my program. At the time, I had a few options like changing code block, or &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt;, or exit code for my program... So I thought that the exit code is a must that my program needed to have and the code block thing is quite more interesting than &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt;. After choosing what I needed to do, I had to file 2 issues so I had something to refer back to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 issues I was talking about:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/18"&gt;First one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/issues/19"&gt;Second one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing code for these 2 issues are quite straightforward. It took me a few minutes to finish it. However, I'm not so sure about the inline code block thing, and should ask my professor about it to make sure that's what he's looking for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for the first issue, I created a new branch called issue-18 and issue-19 for the second issue. When finishing the first issue, I had to &lt;code&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; and switched to branch issue-19 to continue coding. As I've done it, I also had to &lt;code&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;. After that, I had to use &lt;code&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; to merge those 2 branches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#merging-branches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Merging branches
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;git merge issue-18&lt;/code&gt; which is my first issue, git had no problem merging it. It was &lt;code&gt;fast forward&lt;/code&gt; right away. However, for the second issue, when I &lt;code&gt;git merge issue-19&lt;/code&gt;, instead of &lt;code&gt;fast forward&lt;/code&gt;, Git used &lt;code&gt;three way recursive&lt;/code&gt; strategy. Then, I just needed to push it to github so the code will be visible to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg"&gt;Project Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/commit/77d8015a6bf6ff1529daf1b004e130b9111980df"&gt;Commit 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tuanthanh2067/cv-ssg/commit/fd58db14022d83776f31b4ee84c712d5236c1205"&gt;Commit 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
