      <title>Is Node.js Single-Threaded or Multi-Threaded? and Why?</title>
      <author>Andres Reales</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 11:39:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/arealesramirez/is-node-js-single-threaded-or-multi-threaded-and-why-ab1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/arealesramirez/is-node-js-single-threaded-or-multi-threaded-and-why-ab1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you been reading multiple articles trying to understand whether Node.js is single-threaded or multi-threaded? Why are there many of them saying single-threaded and others saying multi-threaded? I’ve been there and after reading one article after another, it seems there’s always a doubt in the back of your mind telling you the concept is still not clear. In this article, I hope to clarify this confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nodejs.dev/learn"&gt;Node.js documentation&lt;/a&gt;, a Node.js application runs using the event loop. The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations and explains how Node.js can be asynchronous. The event loop, aka the main thread, allows running one thing at a time. Having said that, &lt;strong&gt;Node.js JavaScript code runs on a single thread&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are several points you have probably read about in different articles such as using &lt;strong&gt;worker_threads&lt;/strong&gt; making it multi-threaded, or the programming language used to develop Node.js applications makes it single-threaded, etc. I will cover those relevant points, but before we move forward, I’ll refresh your knowledge with regards to what single and multi-thread processes are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-a-singlethreaded-process-is"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What a Single-Threaded Process is
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single-threaded process is the execution of programmed instructions in a single sequence. Having said that, if an application has the following set of instructions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instruction A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instruction B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instruction C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these set of instructions are executed in a single-threaded process, the execution would look like the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dp5YTWtO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vsf84myna0sp2rahh8uj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dp5YTWtO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vsf84myna0sp2rahh8uj.png" alt="Single Thread"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-a-multithreaded-process-is"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What a Multi-Threaded Process is
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multi-threaded process is the execution of programmed instructions in multiple sequences. Therefore, instructions won’t have to wait to execute unless multiple instructions are grouped within different sequences.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--avQGVjRD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zsyg6r77mt4h0n8ql5a6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--avQGVjRD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zsyg6r77mt4h0n8ql5a6.png" alt="Multi thread"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-nodejs-is-singlethreaded"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Node.js is Single-Threaded?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know Node.js architecture is single-threaded. However, why is it single-threaded? My first question for you is, do you understand how the event loop works? If not, I recommend you &lt;a href="https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-loop"&gt;check this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to keep things simple, the event loop runs one process at a time. That means it can only execute one function at a time, and since functions can have multiple instructions, the event loop will execute one instruction at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it sounds not efficient providing poor performance. However, quite the opposite it turns out to be more performant and scalable than other multithreaded alternatives such as Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running a multithreaded solution involves leveraging multiple cores of a system. Having said that, if one thread is waiting for an I/O response, the other threads could still be in progress. In theory, multithread seems the way to go, but what we are not taking into consideration is that a thread could still be blocked regardless of other threads being available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the event loop is not of running everything in a single thread, but it’s available to “put aside” long time-consuming I/O operations to keep the execution of other instructions. This is the reason why we get fast responses even though we could have multiple users making requests to a Node.js API at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to clarify is there is no such thing as making requests at the same time. It is perceived to have run requests at the same time, but in reality, the event loop runs processes defined for each request based on the order in which it arrived. Let’s make this concept simple to understand by using an example. In this case, we are going to assume we have the following API endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/getCars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/updateCar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/updateDriver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, request are not made at the same time. The event loop will handle the requests in the following order assuming that was the order they were requested:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/getCars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/updateCar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/updateDriver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event loop will execute the first instructions from the /getCars endpoint. At some point, there will be an instruction which is a request from the API to a database to fetch the cars. This is considered an I/O operation. This process can take a short or long time to execute. Regardless of how fast this gets executed. The event loop will trigger this request and move it “aside” to prevent blocking the thread from executing other instructions. However, it will resume triggering the set of instructions for the /getCars endpoint once a response is sent back from the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while the request made from the /getCars endpoint to the database is triggered and waiting for a response, the /updateCar endpoint will trigger its set of instructions. If there is not I/O operation within the /updateCar endpoint, the /updateCar endpoint will return a response before the /getCars endpoint returns a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, if the /updateCar endpoints have an instruction to execute an I/O operation, the event loop will trigger it but won’t block the thread from executing instructions. In this way, it could either start executing the set of instructions from the /updateDriver endpoint, or resume the execution of the /getCars endpoint once it receives a response from the database. This is based on whichever is added first in the event queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, the major benefit of Node.js architecture is not the fact of being single-threaded, but its ability to not block the thread from executing other instructions. This is one of the main reasons Node.js is an excellent choice for developing APIs as these are heavily based on I/O operations. The event loop’s smart system to execute intensive I/O operations and resume processes once the I/O operations are completed while not worrying about issues that can come with using multithreaded solutions such as deadlocks or race conditions makes it a no brainer for many teams to use Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dont-block-the-event-loop-aka-the-main-thread"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Don’t Block the Event Loop (aka the Main Thread)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most solutions, there are advantages and disadvantages, and Node.js is not an exclusion of this. Since we know Node.js runs using the event loop, aka as the main thread, blocking the loop will indeed prevent the system from running other instructions regardless of whether they belong to a single process or multiple different processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Didn’t you say the event loop “triggers intensive operations and move them aside, resuming a process once the operations get a response”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to clarify the event loop’s ability to “resume” an I/O operation process doesn’t mean it will be capable of getting away around with an intensive CPU operation. The beauty of an I/O operation is to use external CPU processing power to execute a process. However, &lt;strong&gt;if our Node.js application is the one using intensive CPU processing power to execute power, it means we cannot execute other sets of instructions until the heavy processing power instruction completes. This is called blocking the event loop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#confusing-javascript-and-nodejs-threading-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Confusing JavaScript and Node.js Threading Process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to not say Node.js is single-threaded because the JavaScript programming language is single-threaded. This is incorrect. JavaScript can run in different programming environments, and Node.js being among the most popular environments using JavaScript. Therefore, it is a common misconception to think JavaScript is single-threaded. When speaking about single-threaded or multi-threaded, we should look at how the programming environment operates rather than how the language in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-about-worker-threads-in-nodejs-does-it-make-nodejs-multithreaded"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What About Worker Threads in Node.js? Does it Make Node.js Multi-threaded?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the implementation of worker threads in v10.5.0 allows the use of threads that execute JavaScript in parallel, Node.js event loop architecture is single-threaded based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really happens when spawning multiple threads using &lt;strong&gt;worker_threads&lt;/strong&gt; is the generation of multiple V8 engines sharing memory. Workers threads are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations. This frees up the main thread’s event loop from CPU-heavy processes and keeps it available for what is best for intensive I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expense of generating worker threads doesn’t result in a positive impact around I/O intensive work as in the end, each thread will have the same mechanism: one event loop per thread, which won’t be any different than opting not to use worker threads. Node.js’s built-in asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than workers can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, each thread will use the same Node.js architecture which is single-threaded based. You can achieve multithreading by generating multiple nodes or Node.js V8 engines which in isolation are single-threaded. It is still correct to say Node.js is not multi-threaded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to build login form in html and using pure css in few lines of codes. Let's make today login form using pure css. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.First we need a code editor, &lt;br&gt;
  I am using VS code editor. &lt;br&gt;
2.Let's make index.html and &lt;br&gt;
  style.css file in our &lt;br&gt;
  working folder. &lt;br&gt;
3.Let's add following code in y our editor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q_5KXayw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xe5tdae34iawf9x0j5pn.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q_5KXayw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xe5tdae34iawf9x0j5pn.jpg" alt="reset code"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Now,time to work on style &lt;br&gt;
  file. &lt;br&gt;
5.First, reset all auto margin &lt;br&gt;
  and padding of browser.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WcpTFfhO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a2pus2sk1pafrkhajoft.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WcpTFfhO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a2pus2sk1pafrkhajoft.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
6.Let's work on wrapper class &lt;br&gt;
  style,add following code in &lt;br&gt;
  css file. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xrVfGRUH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tku05owjm34ig66wrq0v.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xrVfGRUH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tku05owjm34ig66wrq0v.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
7.Now add style on inside &lt;br&gt;
  wrapper class elements, I &lt;br&gt;
  did it and code is below&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running Dapr on Kubernetes</title>
      <author>Ivan Cvitkovic</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 10:53:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cvitaa11/running-dapr-on-kubernetes-89g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cvitaa11/running-dapr-on-kubernetes-89g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The distributed application runtime, Dapr, is a portable, event-driven runtime that can run on the cloud or any edge infrastructure. It puts together the best practices for building microservice applications into components called building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each building block is completely independent so you can use one, some, or all of them in your application. Building blocks are extensible, so you can also write your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dapr supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks such as .NET, Java, Node.js, Go and Python. That means you can write microservice apps using your favorite tools and deploy them literally anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yQ1_eJLG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://docs.dapr.io/images/overview.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yQ1_eJLG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://docs.dapr.io/images/overview.png" alt="Architecture Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, building blocks are just HTTP or gRPC APIs that can be called from application code and use one or more Dapr components. They abstract some of the major challenges during development such as service-to-service communication, state managment, pub/sub, observability and more. Building blocks do not depend on underlying technology. This means if you need to implement, for example, pub/sub functionality you can use Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, Azure Service Bus or any other supported broker that interface with Dapr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example we will show how to run Dapr on the Kubernetes cluster with two .NET applications. First one will send messages to Apache Kafka while the second one will read those messages and store them in Redis. Communication to Kafka and Redis will be realized using the Dapr Client, which means that we will not have any dependencies on NuGet packages like &lt;code&gt;Confluent.Kafka&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;StackExchange.Redis&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WHagNN1g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvitaa11/dapr-demo/main/Architecture_diagram.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WHagNN1g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cvitaa11/dapr-demo/main/Architecture_diagram.jpeg" alt="Architecture Diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prerequisites"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prerequisites
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demo requires you to have the following installed on your machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes CLI &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/"&gt;kubectl&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes cluster, such as &lt;a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/cluster/setup-minikube/"&gt;Minikube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop"&gt;Docker Desktop&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, clone the repository and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the right directory:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/cvitaa11/dapr-demo
cd dapr-demo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-setup-dapr-on-your-kubernetes-cluster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 - Setup Dapr on your Kubernetes cluster
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need is an RBAC enabled Kubernetes cluster. This could be running on your machine using Minikube/Docker Desktop, or it could be a fully-fledged cluser in Azure using &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/"&gt;AKS&lt;/a&gt; or some other managed Kubernetes instance from different cloud vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a cluster, follow the steps below to deploy Dapr to it. For more details, look &lt;a href="https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr/#install-dapr-on-a-kubernetes-cluster"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ dapr init -k
⌛  Making the jump to hyperspace...
ℹ️  Note: To install Dapr using Helm, see here: https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-kubernetes/#install-with-helm-advanced

✅  Deploying the Dapr control plane to your cluster...
✅  Success! Dapr has been installed to namespace dapr-system. To verify, run `dapr status -k' in your terminal. To get started, go here: https://aka.ms/dapr-getting-started
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dapr&lt;/code&gt; CLI will exit as soon as the kubernetes deployments are created. Kubernetes deployments are asyncronous, so you will need to make sure that the dapr deployments are actually completed before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-setup-apache-kafka"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 - Setup Apache Kafka
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to setup Apache Kafka on your Kubernetes cluster is by using &lt;a href="https://helm.sh/"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; package manager. To install Helm on your development machine follow this &lt;a href="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
We will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts"&gt;Bitnamy Library for Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; to launch Zookeper and Kafka message broker.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-release bitnami/kafka
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-setup-redis"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 - Setup Redis
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Apache Kafka, easy way to spin up Redis on your Kubernetes cluster is by using Helm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install redis bitnami/redis
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To verify the installation of Kafka and Redis run &lt;code&gt;kubectl get all&lt;/code&gt; and you should see similiar output:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NAME                             READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-create-dapr-components-in-kubernetes-cluster"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4 - Create Dapr components in Kubernetes cluster
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deploy pub/sub and state store components make sure you are positioned in the right directory and then apply Dapr YAML manifests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd dapr-components
kubectl apply -f .\kafka.yaml
kubectl apply -f .\redis.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-deploy-net-core-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5 - Deploy .NET Core applications
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when all prerequisites are ready we can deploy our apps. To deploy .NET Core publisher and consumer applications make sure you are positioned in the right directory and then apply Kubernetes manifests.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd k8s
kubectl apply -f .\publisher.yaml
kubectl apply -f .\consumer.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each manifest contains &lt;code&gt;Deployment&lt;/code&gt; object for the application and &lt;code&gt;Service&lt;/code&gt; object for accessing the application through a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;localhost:8081/swagger&lt;/code&gt; and you will se our publisher app with a POST method on &lt;code&gt;MessageController&lt;/code&gt;. This action sends a message to &lt;em&gt;newMessage&lt;/em&gt; topic on Kafka pub/sub component. Communication between application and message broker is not performed directly. Dapr is running as a sidecar container inside publisher pod and handles the entire process of sending a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our consumer application is running on &lt;code&gt;localhost:9091&lt;/code&gt; and is subscribed to &lt;em&gt;newMessage&lt;/em&gt; topic on Kafka pub/sub component. When new message arrives it reads the content and trough the Dapr client saves it to Redis state store uneder the key &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test the entire process we can run Redis client pod and check if content is stored. First of all we will export password to REDIS_PASSWORD variable:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then run the client with the following command:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl run --namespace default redis-client --rm --tty -i --restart='Never' \
    --env REDIS_PASSWORD=$REDIS_PASSWORD \
   --image docker.io/bitnami/redis:6.0.12-debian-10-r3 -- bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and connect using Redis CLI:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;redis-cli -h redis-master -a $REDIS_PASSWORD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that you are connected to Redis you can use command &lt;code&gt;HGETALL message&lt;/code&gt; that will return content of the message we sent to Kafka. With this we have confirmed that the whole process works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out more about Dapr, the best place to start is the official &lt;a href="https://dapr.io/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Keep your software updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use different passwords for different accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never give away your private key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t click on unknown or suspicious links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a secure Internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escrow. Escrow in the financial sense means an arrangement where a third party (not the buyer or the seller)  holds funds in safekeeping pending the completion of a promised obligation. And enables users to get guaranteed transactons. It is best if it is open source software so that users can verify the integrity of the smart contract and the absence of errors in the code. &lt;br&gt;
Reviews and rating system. On the Paxful website, users can distinguish reliable counterparties from unscrupulous or scammers. They can be positive, neutral or negative. You can leave a response instantly after the successful completion of the transaction (or its failure). &lt;br&gt;
Customer support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-3-monetization-of-the-cryptocurrency-exchange"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3. Monetization of the cryptocurrency exchange
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publication fee. &lt;br&gt;
Buyer creates an escrow account&lt;br&gt;
One of the two parties, either the Buyer or Seller, will initiate the transaction. This process begins when the user inquires about the offering and creates an account on CryptoExchange. With an account set up, the two parties can solidify the terms of their agreement.&lt;br&gt;
Advertisements. Advertising promotion fees, posters, contextual advertising and paid links - all this is used on the site and in the Paxful application to increase the profitability of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-4-marketing-strategy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 4: Marketing Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paxful cryptocurrency exchange was launched in 2014 and is a peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace, has recently entered India. In the first 21 weeks of 2020, Paxful has recorded a minimum of $1 million in weekly volumes. Since the beginning of May 2020, the weekly traded Bitcoin volumes have grown setting three consecutive all-time highs – with the week ending 17th May recording a total of $1.521 million (ATH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-5-development-approaches"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 5. Development approaches
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Template Solution. You can create a crypto exchange like Paxful using ready-made software. You can get it for free, for example, on GitHub, or buy for 300 - 1000 dollars. Free solutions usually have poor functionality and are not well tested for errors and other vulnerabilities. Paxful clones software sold may vary by manufacturer.&lt;br&gt;
Development from scratch. A more complex and expensive option to create a Paxful clone software, but it gives you more control over the development process and allows you to implement unique software solutions. The cost of creating a P2P crypto exchanger from scratch usually varies from 20 to 50 thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 6. Get the consultation from the experienced clone script providers
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is usually developed by well-experienced and qualified experts. They take care of everything from development, design, testing, and deployment, allowing you to focus on just the customization part. There are many advantages involved with purchasing and deploying a Paxful clone script for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/bharadwaj6262/top-data-science-competition-platforms-3g4n</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, friends!! How are you? Hope you are doing well! In this blog, I am going to share some of the Top Data Science competition platforms that you should check. Ok then, let's go deep into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaggle is one of the most popular platforms in the world for Data Science!&lt;/strong&gt; And there are a lot of competitions on Kaggle that you can enter to sharpen your Data Science skills. These competitions range from identifying wheat using image analysis to predicting lung function decline due to pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These competitions allow the brightest minds in data science to compete and obtain some solutions to serious problems in the world(while winning a cash prize is just a bonus!). So if you are new to data science competitions, then you should start with Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some easy competitions you can practice on and then move on to the active world-changing competitions with hefty cash prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://idao.world/"&gt;International Data Analysis Olympiad (IDAO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Data Analysis Olympiad is a data science competition that is open to everyone, whether they be undergraduate, postgraduate, or Ph.D. students or even company employees or new data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This competition aims to increase the skills of the professionals in data science so that they can adequately fill the industry demand in this field.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two rounds of IDAO. The first round is a data science competition where the participants are provided a labeled training set and asked to predict the test data. The second round focuses more on efficiency and so the participants have to solve the same problem as the first round but with tight restrictions on time and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drivendata.org/"&gt;DrivenData&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DrivenData is an online platform that aims to solve some of the biggest social challenges in the world using innovations in data science&lt;/strong&gt;. consequently, it has various online challenges that last two or three months and various data scientists compete in these challenges to find the best solution for difficult predictive problems that occur in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the online challenges include detecting hateful content in memes, predicting dengue disease spread, predicting damage to buildings by earthquakes, etc. Science these challenges aim to solve problems and learn more about data science, the code submitted by the winners is released under an open-source license so that everyone can learn and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.topcoder.com/"&gt;Topcoder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topcoder has many different challenges that allow participants to learn more about data science also win prices at the same time! Most of the challenges offer reward money but some are just there to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most famous challenge is the annual Topcoder open which has various competition tracks based on data science, design, competitive programming, and software development&lt;/strong&gt;. The most successful candidates are invited for a free one-week trip on the on-site finals, where they can win lots of prizes also learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topcoder also has smaller regional events throughout the year that are not as big as Topcoder Open but still allow different people to participate and improve their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://codalab.org/"&gt;Codalab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codalab is an open-source platform that has various data science competitions&lt;/strong&gt;. These competitions do not have a high range of cash prizes, but they still offer participants the opportunity to learn more about data science and create efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These competitions are a great way to learn more about collaboration and finding solutions with a team as Codalab focuses on the programming and a code-building of data in the competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most popular of these include the Liver Tumor segmentation challenge, Microsoft COCO image captioning challenge, MAFAT Radar Challenge, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reading and writing data across different AWS accounts with Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow v2.x</title>
      <author>Ricardo Sueiras</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 10:33:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws/reading-and-writing-data-across-different-aws-accounts-with-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-v2-x-3319</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws/reading-and-writing-data-across-different-aws-accounts-with-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-v2-x-3319</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading and writing data across different AWS accounts in you Apache Airflow DAGs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regular readers will know, I sometimes lurk in the Apache Airflow slack channel to see what is going on. If you are new to Apache Airflow, or want to get a deeper understanding then I highly recommend spending some time here. The community is super welcoming and eager to help new participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during a recent session I came across an interesting problem that one of the builders was having, which was how to access (read/write) data in an S3 bucket which was in a different account to the one hosting Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post will be a quick look at the setup, the error that occurred and how to configure MWAA so that you can read/write data confidently across your different AWS accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The problem
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A customer was using MWAA 2.0.2, and within their workflow, they were trying to upload data to an S3 bucket in a different AWS account to what their MWAA environment was running in. When they triggered their DAG, they were getting errors such as the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt; An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation: Access Denied
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help with troubleshooting, the customer had created a test DAG that would try and read/write files to a sample S3 bucket in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using boto3, the Python SDK for interacting with AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Apache Airflow operators - airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.s3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using the pandas Python library - using s3fs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the test DAG that the customer put together&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import logging
import random
from datetime import timedelta
import pandas as pd
import boto3
from airflow.models import Variable
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.s3 import S3Hook
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago


def save_file_to_s3():
    n = random.randint(100, 10000)
    filename = f'demo_{n}.csv'
    local_file_path = f'/tmp/{filename}'
    demo_data = pd.DataFrame({'num_legs': [2, 4, 8, 0],
                              'num_wings': [2, 0, 0, 0],
                              'num_specimen_seen': [10, 2, 1, 8]},
                             index=['falcon', 'dog', 'spider', 'fish'])
    demo_data.to_csv(local_file_path, index=False)

    bucket_name = Variable.get('TEST_BUCKET')
    folder_name = Variable.get('TEST_FOLDER')
    s3_key = f'{folder_name}/boto3_{filename}'
    logging.info(f'local_file_path: {local_file_path}, bucket_name: {bucket_name}, key: {s3_key}')

    logging.info('Uploading CSV to S3 with boto3')
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    try:
        s3.meta.client.upload_file(local_file_path, bucket_name, s3_key, ExtraArgs={'ACL': 'bucket-owner-full-control'})
    except Exception as e:
        logging.info(e)
        pass
    logging.info('Done uploading CSV to S3 with boto3')
    logging.info('Uploading CSV to S3 with S3HOOK')
    s3_hook = S3Hook()
    s3_key = f'{folder_name}/s3hook_{filename}'
    try:
        s3_hook.load_file(local_file_path, bucket_name=bucket_name, key=s3_key, acl_policy='bucket-owner-full-control')
    except Exception as e:
        logging.info(e)
        pass
    logging.info('Done uploading CSV to S3 with S3HOOK')

    logging.info('Uploading CSV to S3 with pandas')
    demo_data.to_csv(f's3://{bucket_name}/{folder_name}/pandas_{filename}', index=False)
    logging.info('Done uploading CSV to S3 with pandas')


def run_dag():
    save_file_to_s3()


dag_default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'email': ['airflow@example.com'],
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 0,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=2)
}

with DAG(
    'demo',
    default_args=dag_default_args,
    description='description',
    schedule_interval="0 10 * * *",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    tags=['test'],
) as dag:
    test_dag = PythonOperator(
        task_id="test_dag",
        python_callable=run_dag
    )

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What was interesting, was that when they ran the DAG, the boto3 function would write the file to the target S3 bucket, but the other two failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-approach"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The approach
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if I could reproduce this issue, so the approach I took was to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ set up an environment running the same version of MWAA as the customer, but initially use an S3 bucket in the SAME account to make sure that everything works as expected, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ setup a new S3 bucket on a different AWS account and repeat to see if I could reproduce the error, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ review CloudTrail and MWAA logs to see if I could identify any issues and fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The setup
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer was running a standard MWAA 2.0.2 environment in one AWS account, so I quickly provisioned an environment (using my CDK application &lt;a href="https://dev.to/aws/using-aws-cdk-to-deploy-your-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-environment-12cf"&gt;which I have blogged about before&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deployed the above DAG, and then had to do a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new S3 bucket (in my case, I called this "ricsue-airflow-s3hook" and within this bucket, I created a folder called "s3permissions")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adjusted the permissions for the MWAA execution role (which you can find by opening up your MWAA environment in the AWS console) to include the new bucket I just created
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::airflow-ricsue-cdk-demo/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::airflow-ricsue-cdk-demo",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ricsue-airflow-s3hook/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ricsue-airflow-s3hook"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;within the MWAA console, using the Admin menu option in the Apache Airflow UI, I created two new variables: TEST_BUKCET (with a value of "ricsue-airflow-s3hook") and TEST_FOLDER (with a value of "s3permissions")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had completed that, I enabled it and then manually triggered it. It failed with the following error:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2021-09-06 12:36:26,255] {{customer-s3.py:26}} INFO - local_file_path: /tmp/demo_2025.csv, bucket_name: ricsue-airflow-s3hook, key: s3permissions/boto3_demo_2025.csv

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whilst the boto3 and Apache Airflow operators had worked, the Python library (pandas) had not. This is because they were not installed on the Apache Airflow worker nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I amended the requirements text to add the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fsspec
s3fs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once uploaded, the MWAA environment had to be updated. This took approx 20 mins, but once it completed, I was then able to trigger the DAG successfully. No errors, and when I looked in the local S3 bucket, I could see the following files:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;boto3_demo_9977.csv
s3hook_demo_9977.csv
pandas_demo_9977.csv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, the first step completed - we have everything working as expected. Now to change the DAG to write those files to an S3 bucket in a different AWS account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-error"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The error
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reproduce the same setup as the customer, I had to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new S3 bucket in a different AWS account - (in my case, I called this "ricsue-airflow-s3hook-diffawsaccount" and within this bucket, I kept the same folder called "s3permissions")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to UPDATE the Apache Airflow variable, TEST_BUCKET. From within the Apache Airflow UI, I edited the value to point to this new bucket and the different AWS account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this easier, I had two browsers running with Chrome running my AWS account with MWAA, and Firefox running a different AWS account with just the Amazon S3 bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had made those changes, I triggered the DAG again. I did not expect ANY of these ways to upload the file to work given that these are two separate AWS accounts, but I wanted to baseline. Sure enough, I got the following error with the DAG failing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see, all three methods failed. Exactly what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was strange was that the customer was not seeing this issue, and was able to write to the target S3 bucket using boto3. Lets see how to reproduce that in my environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-fix"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The fix
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within your Amazon S3 bucket, you have the ability to define bucket policies that allow access to read/write files from other AWS accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the NEW AWS account, I created the following bucket policy for the new bucket I had created ("ricsue-airflow-s3hook-diffawsaccount"). This is what I added:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::704533066374:role/mwaa-2-eks-role"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject*",
                "s3:GetBucket*",
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:PutObject*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ricsue-airflow-s3hook-diffawsaccount/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ricsue-airflow-s3hook-diffawsaccount"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The policy containers the arn of the MWAA execution role for my MWAA environment in my original AWS account, configures allowed actions (in this instance, I have narrowed it down to these actions - GetObject* , GetBucket* , List* , and PutObject* ) and then configured the target S3 buckets resources (here it is all resources under this bucket, but you could also reduce the scope to just certain folders if you wanted to)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saved this, and then re-ran the DAG. Success, it all worked.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But wait, that does not describe the customer problem. They could get it working with boto3, so what is going on then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I altered the bucket policy so that it had fewer permissions, specifically removing the List* as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::704533066374:role/mwaa-2-eks-role"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject*",
                "s3:GetBucket*",
                "s3:PutObject*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ricsue-airflow-s3hook-diffawsaccount/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ricsue-airflow-s3hook-diffawsaccount"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when I re-ran the DAG, boto3 worked, but the S3 Hook and the pandas failed with permissions errors:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, we can close that loop. We now understand under what scenarios this might work (target S3 bucket policy not having the right permissions for the various methods of uploading files) and we can address/solve this as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I showed you how you can set up your S3 buckets so that you can use them to read and write data from your MWAA environment. I showed you how this works whether you are doing this via boto3, using the Apache Airflow S3 operator,  or doing this via a third party Python library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Magic URL Login to Appwrite</title>
      <author>Torsten Dittmann</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 10:17:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/appwrite/introducing-magic-url-login-to-appwrite-2l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/appwrite/introducing-magic-url-login-to-appwrite-2l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Appwrite 0.10 introduces &lt;strong&gt;Magic URL&lt;/strong&gt; as an authentication method, which allows users to create an account without providing a password and login with a URL sent via an E-Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature is especially useful if you want to provide a passwordless authentication process for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XwPWEfwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/koceo7503ykvehk3cibc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XwPWEfwx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/koceo7503ykvehk3cibc.png" alt="Appwrite Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚙️ Setup
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's learn how we can add Magic URL Authentication to a Web Application using our &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-web"&gt;Web SDK&lt;/a&gt;. The same can be done with our &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-flutter"&gt;Flutter SDK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-android"&gt;Android SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to add our Web SDK to our project with NPM like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;appwrite &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you're using a bundler (like &lt;a href="https://rollupjs.org/"&gt;Rollup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/"&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt;), you can import the Appwrite module when you need it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To install with a CDN (content delivery network) add the following script to your HTML file before you use any Appwrite services:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appwrite"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to initialize your SDK code with your project ID which can be found in your project settings page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Init your Web SDK&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;appwrite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appwrite&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setEndpoint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;http://localhost/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your Appwrite Endpoint&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;455x34dfkj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Your Appwrite Project ID&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#create-a-magic-url"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🎩 Create a Magic URL
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your SDK is setup, access the &lt;strong&gt;Account service&lt;/strong&gt; and call the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountCreateMagicURLSession"&gt;&lt;code&gt;createMagicURLSession()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method. The method accepts an e-mail address and a redirect URL as arguments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Initiate the Magic URL login&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createMagicURLSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name@example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Success&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Failure&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountCreateMagicURLSession"&gt;&lt;code&gt;createMagicURLSession()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method completes without error, the request sends the user an email with a URL containing a secret key for the next step. When the user clicks the link, they are redirected back to the URL you provided with the secret key and userId values attached to the URL query string. This link is valid for 1 hour. If the e-mail passed did not belong to any existing user - this request will also create a user for the passed e-mail address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#login-with-a-magic-url"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🔐 Login with a Magic URL
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the user is able to initialize the authentication process, we need to complete it by handling the redirect from the URL provided in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountUpdateMagicURLSession"&gt;&lt;code&gt;updateMagicURLSession()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method and call it with the secret and userId values from the URL's query string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that in order to avoid a &lt;a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md"&gt;Redirect Attack&lt;/a&gt; the only valid redirect URLs are the ones from domains you have set when adding your platforms in the console interface.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlParams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;URLSearchParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;urlParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;appwrite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;updateMagicURLSession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;secret&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Failure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;a href="https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account?sdk=web#accountUpdateMagicURLSession"&gt;&lt;code&gt;updateMagicURLSession()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; succeeded, the user is now logged in. Note that once a link is used, it cannot be used again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;

      <title>Making digital currency; How to create a new cryptocurrency
</title>
      <author>ahmadradindev</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 10:09:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/ahmadradindev/making-digital-currency-how-to-create-a-new-cryptocurrency-2c7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/ahmadradindev/making-digital-currency-how-to-create-a-new-cryptocurrency-2c7</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many startups have made a lot of money by creating a digital currency and selling tokens in the initial public offering. Creating a new digital currency may seem like an impossible process to most people. While making digital currency is possible if you have enough knowledge in this field. In this article, we will introduce you to the methods of making a digital currency and at the end, we will answer some common questions in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are new digital currencies being created?&lt;br&gt;
Even if virtual money has been available to the public for a long time, Bitcoin is the first known and most successful cryptocurrency in the cryptocurrency market. Many cryptocurrencies have been created today, the most popular of which are Bitcoin, Ripple, and Atrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some unique features make companies and individuals think about creating cryptocurrencies. The most important features of digital currency are cryptography, security and confidentiality, no need to monitor a central institution, transparency of transactions, fast transactions, and ease of transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-difference-between-coins-and-digital-currency-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The difference between coins and digital currency tokens
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people mistakenly use tokens and quins as synonyms. While Token and Quinn are different. The most important thing that distinguishes a token from a quin is the lack of an independent blockchain. Tokens are created on the platform of other blockchains. But Quinn has an independent blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important difference between coins and tokens is that coins are used to buy and sell and are considered a method of payment. While most tokens can be used for use in an application or as an asset. Bitcoin, Atrium, Ripple, and Light Coin are the most popular coins in the digital currency market. Tetra, Chainlink, Dai, and Avi are also in the category of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#digital-currency-making-training-introducing-3-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Digital currency making training; Introducing 3 methods
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-one-create-a-new-digital-currency-by-creating-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method one: Create a new digital currency by creating tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make digital currency is to create tokens. As we have said, a token is a digital currency that does not have its independent blockchain and has been created and launched in the context of another blockchain. For this reason, when a token is generated, there is no need to work on the rules of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making tokens is cost-effective for blockchain developers because they do not need the astronomical cost of designing a blockchain to achieve their goals. Of course, it is also important to note that many digital currencies, when in their infancy, are implemented on another blockchain platform to save costs, but once they have been sufficiently developed, a dedicated blockchain for They are used to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The token can be created on all blockchain platforms that use smart contracts. Atrium is one of the most popular token-building platforms. At the time of writing, Atrium has hosted more than 80% of the tokens on the market. Bainenschin, Ias, Kazmas, Thezos, and Theron are other common platforms for making tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atrium's programming language is solidity. Solidarity uses concepts that exist in other programming languages ​​such as PHP. It is a high-level programming language that has all the capabilities and capabilities needed for blockchain software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-2-create-digital-currency-by-copying-and-modifying-current-blockchains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 2: Create digital currency by copying and modifying current blockchains
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to build digital currency is to use open-source blockchains. Open source blocks are made available to the public with programming code after they are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atrium and Bitcoin programming codes are also open source and can be accessed by anyone on GitHub. Many blockchains have been launched following the example of these two digital currencies. For example, by making a few changes to the Bitcoin blockchain, the LightCoin network is created.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 3: Create a digital currency by creating a new blockchain
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build digital currency through the new blockchain&lt;br&gt;
Building and designing a blockchain network is another way to create a new digital currency. In a blockchain, data is stored in blocks and forms an interconnected chain. This structure creates an immutable storage system. The blocks are connected using hashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new blockchain requires deep programming knowledge and a lot of time. In the following, the steps of creating a new digital currency through making blockchain are outlined in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the consensus mechanism&lt;br&gt;
Consensus mechanisms are protocols for verifying transactions performed in blockchain without the need for a third party (intermediary). Proof of work and the stock proof is currently the most well-known and basic blockchain consensus mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the blockchain platform&lt;br&gt;
The correct choice of blockchain platform depends on the consensus mechanism you have chosen. The best blockchain operating systems are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum&lt;br&gt;
Waves (WAVES)&lt;br&gt;
Hyperledger Fabric&lt;br&gt;
NEM&lt;br&gt;
IBM blockchain&lt;br&gt;
Nxt (NXT)&lt;br&gt;
HydraChain&lt;br&gt;
BlockStarter&lt;br&gt;
BigChainDB&lt;br&gt;
EOS&lt;br&gt;
Quorum&lt;br&gt;
IOTA&lt;br&gt;
CoinList&lt;br&gt;
MultiChain&lt;br&gt;
Open chain&lt;br&gt;
Chain Core&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design the nodes&lt;br&gt;
You need to decide how the blockchain works and design the nodes accordingly. For example, will the licenses be private or public? Will the hosting be on-premises web systems or cloud systems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specify the blockchain architecture&lt;br&gt;
Before launching a digital currency, you need to be sure of all aspects; Because you can not change multiple blockchain parameters after startup. For example, you need to specify what address blockchain will follow to track exchanges of different cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design the user interface&lt;br&gt;
If your user interface is not good, the cipher project will fail. You need to make sure you are using the latest version of FTP servers, databases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frequently-asked-questions-about-making-new-digital-currencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frequently Asked Questions about Making New Digital Currencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does making a digital currency always lead to profitability?&lt;br&gt;
No. More than a few hundred thousand digital currencies have been launched on various platforms, many of which have failed. For this reason, all aspects of work must be well weighed before creating a digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the reason for the failure of some new digital currencies?&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, this perspective often causes us to become overwhelmed when it's time to start a new digital currency. That's why we see so many teams being forgotten after spending so much money and energy to create a new digital currency, without gaining popularity. One of the main reasons for their failure is that they failed to do good marketing. Therefore, before any action, the marketing system must be well defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the first step in building a new digital currency?&lt;br&gt;
The first step in creating a new digital currency is to have a well-defined digital currency white paper. White paper in the world of digital currencies means a comprehensive and complete report of the problem that the introduced project seeks to solve. Project objectives should be clearly defined within the white paper. A standard and complete white paper include an abstract, introduction, problem definition, product description, technical details, descriptions of the new digital currency, details of the public offering, and introduction of the development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost to create a new digital currency?&lt;br&gt;
Creating new passwords is not an easy task and will probably require some financial resources; Unless you can handle things like development, documentation, and marketing. The cost of building an encrypted currency depends on several factors, and no specific number can be specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concluding-remarks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Concluding remarks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new dedicated currency may seem like an attractive and profitable offer at first, but we must not forget that there are many challenges in this direction. For this reason, sufficient market research must be done before any action is taken. On the other hand, the necessary capital must be provided for manufacturing and marketing. Otherwise, the digital currency project is likely to fail in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/zernonia/10-amazing-og-image-inspiration-5h67</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designing an eye-capturing &lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt; can be easy, and can be difficult.&lt;br&gt;
That's why, let's look at some of the awesome design that I've curated here. But before that, just in case you don't know what is &lt;code&gt;og:*&lt;/code&gt;, here's a small preview of what og can do to display your website beautifully on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MoBAExFQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bd9c6edpeb1ko47n3j0v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MoBAExFQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bd9c6edpeb1ko47n3j0v.png" alt="Facebook display OG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is og? Well, we will leave it for another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  SaaS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-calendly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a popular software, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://calendly.com/"&gt;Calendly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; no doubt has one of the most simple and beautiful &lt;code&gt;og:image&lt;/code&gt;. Just a simple screenshot of your landing page is sufficed. If you are building a Software-as-a-Service, this approach is highly encouraged!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BIVXD6IQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.ctfassets.net/k0lk9kiuza3o/6GX3BEB2StTLRWYuFW9UBj/23d815c203c7f9dbd25a024ce1842ee8/Homepage.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BIVXD6IQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.ctfassets.net/k0lk9kiuza3o/6GX3BEB2StTLRWYuFW9UBj/23d815c203c7f9dbd25a024ce1842ee8/Homepage.png" alt="Calendly og:image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  2. Billi
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://billi.app/"&gt;Billi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is another software that has a beautiful preview link when shared on social media.(Facebook, Twitter, Discord, etc.). The emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Device&lt;/strong&gt; as shown in the og already provides the visitors that this is a mobile apps before landing on their websites. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build your chat bot with DialogFlow </title>
      <author>Hari Krishnan</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 10:04:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hariraghupathy/build-your-chat-bot-with-dialogflow-3i6g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hariraghupathy/build-your-chat-bot-with-dialogflow-3i6g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is dialog flow ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialog flow is a NLP platform that helps us to provide new ways for users to interact with our product, let the product be anything like a mobile app, web app, interactive voice response system, bots etc. Before going with the implementation we have to have some basic idea about some terminologies of dialog flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPLEMENTATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a dialog flow agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an agent ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agent represents an &lt;code&gt;individual chat bot&lt;/code&gt; and the chat bot is literally a took that takes user input as text or speech and translates it to structured data format which we can use for further evaluation in our app. For easy understanding, consider &lt;code&gt;Dialog flow as a virtual call center&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;agent is a customer service representative&lt;/code&gt; who has been trained to solve a variety of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case let's create an agent which would help our users to update their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create intents for the agent. An agent can have multiple intents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an intent ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an agent receives input (end-user expression) from the user, the agent has identify the intention of the query or information from the user. For this we have to create multiple intents which will be auto identified by the agent with the help of pre-existing machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the personal information agent, we can create our first intent called the UpdatePersonalInfo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create training phrases for the intent we have created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are training phrases ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are occurrences or short phrases from the user that will trigger this intent. The machine learning algorithm is going to use Natural Language Processing to figure out which phrases are similar to the one's we add here. The more data we add here, we will get more accurate results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our UpdatePersonalInfo intent, we can add training phrases like &lt;code&gt;Change my display name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;How to change my name ?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;How to change my email ?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;How to update my personal information ?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;I want to update my personal information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are parameters ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user triggers an intent, usually there are multiple pieces of information required in order to successfully solve the problem, which can be achieved by using parameters. We can set optional and mandatory parameters that dialog flow will try to collect from the user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creating parameters, dialog flow will require us to map the pre-defined &lt;strong&gt;entities&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;code&gt;@sys.any&lt;/code&gt; to automatically validate the input from the user, if it is an email parameter we can have the entity as &lt;code&gt;@sys.email&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also set up the prompts for the parameters which dialog flow will use to query the user for the mandatory information. For example, for the name parameter, the prompt will be &lt;code&gt;What is your name ?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulfillment &lt;code&gt;(Default response or via webhook)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the previous step if the user receives some input from the end-user, if we don't have any additional work to do in the backend, we can &lt;code&gt;simply define a response in the dialog flow console&lt;/code&gt;. But in a lot of cases, we have to make a call to an api which would be required to fetch responses from a completely separate system and for this, &lt;code&gt;we need to use a webhook&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabling the webhook will allow us to write custom code on the backend server to format the responses dynamically and handle anything else that the user is trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
