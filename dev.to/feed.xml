&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this tutorial we will explore how to share geospatial data on the web, in a simple and efficient way. You can use the provided dataset or use your own dataset, in order to implement the pipeline to make it available with a REST API, using a stack of free and open source software.&lt;br&gt;
We will conclude by exploring the deployed service using a swagger endpoint and postman, but "sky is the limit" in terms of client applications which could consume this dataset.&lt;br&gt;
In order to complete this, you will only need some basic knowledge of docker and docker-compose. The links used in the tutorial are listed bellow. Have fun!🙃&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey to Becoming a Google Developer Student Clubs Lead</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/theinsightfulcoder/my-journey-to-becoming-a-google-developer-student-clubs-lead-5cg2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, it's  &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-ashish/"&gt;Sai Ashish Konchada&lt;/a&gt;  back after a hiatus for good. The past few months have been a rollercoaster ride, a wave of happy hormones with nervous adventures. It gives me immense pleasure to announce that I've been selected as the first-ever Google Developer Student Clubs Lead at my college. In this post, we will be looking into the journey from the application to the selection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-what-is-google-developer-student-clubs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. What is Google Developer Student Clubs?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the official  &lt;a href="https://gdsc.community.dev/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Google Developer Student Clubs are university-based community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/earTjC0iSjg"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Developer Student Clubs(GDSC) are like your college/ university clubs, powered by Google Developers. Every year, Google selects leads from across the globe who align with the vision of GDSC and want to empower their community. This year, there are around 352 leads selected across India. There are many first-time leads,  as well as leads who continue the legacy initiated by the founder/former lead. It is not necessary if your college has an existing GDSC, then a lead will definitely be selected from your campus for the following year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-can-become-a-google-developer-student-club-lead"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who can become a Google Developer Student Club Lead?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per the  &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc/leads"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, these are the eligibility criteria to become a lead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a minimum of one year left until graduation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program at a college or university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can commit to the program for one year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passionate about creating impact in the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong technical understanding of computer programming and/or software engineering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have experience with event planning or leading a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have some connection to the local developer community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host an event ideally once a month, and at least every 3 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-what-are-the-roles-and-responsibilities-of-a-lead"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. What are the roles and responsibilities of a lead?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 basic responsibilities of a lead include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-startinggrowing-a-club"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  i. Starting/Growing a club
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rrFJiryr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635850852805/8zSMX4ylo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rrFJiryr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635850852805/8zSMX4ylo.png" alt="Google Developer Student Clubs Shree L R Tiwari College of Engineering" width="880" height="223"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're the first-ever lead of a GDSC, you found and set up the club. For this, you might have to talk to your respective Teacher Incharge of such programs at your college, taking permission from the respective Head of Department and Principal for the same. This varies from college to college, so get in touch with a senior or teacher for the same. Being the Technical Head of my college I already was in touch with my respective HOD and Technical Incharge. I wrote a letter to them, explaining about GDSC, its benefits, the impact it creates, and permission for the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get the approval, you have to find a Faculty Incharge and form your Core Team. Find a faculty in charge, who actively takes the initiative for promoting such activities in your college, manages any scheduling conflicts, and provides insights about the events you conduct, suggests improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forming the core team depends on you. You have the complete freedom to choose the number of members in your team, the hierarchy, and the domains you want to have. It is recommended to have 5 people in your core team as at the end of the year, Google sends 5 members(apart from the lead) the Graduation kit consisting of goodies. However, as mentioned earlier you can have more than 5 people and choose the top 5 people working diligently towards the club activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 widely followed approaches in forming the core team. The first one is the Interview process. You create an announcement, people apply for the respective roles, you shortlist, conduct interviews, and choose members. The other one is that if you already know the people in your college and see people fit for the role, you choose them. My suggestion is to choose people who possess not only strong technical knowledge but also the ability to deliver sessions, connect with people, solve their individual doubts, give creative ideas for the growth of the clubs. You can choose to add a set of Behavioral questions to test this aspect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're the lead of an already existing GDSC, get in touch with your former lead, understand their vision, the events they've conducted, how they organized and dealt with various situations, how they can collaborate with existing GDSCs and other organizations, how to approach speakers and sponsorships for events, etc. Your lead is the best person you can find to elaborate in-depth about the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ii-host-workshops"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ii. Host Workshops
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x3S-EXLG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635851401403/Xd8Axw2--.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x3S-EXLG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635851401403/Xd8Axw2--.png" alt="Introduction to Hacktoberfest.png" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After forming the core team, you can kickstart your journey with the Orientation session. You'd be provided with a timeline of events conducted by Google. You can choose to conduct those events as well as events of your own. I'll be writing a separate blog on how to create, promote and conduct your GDSC events once you become a lead. This is one of the workshops we conducted, where we introduced students to open source, how to contribute to it, and get started with Github. You can find the recording of the workshop &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/c4BA3sV98Y4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iii-build-projects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  iii. Build projects
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ox4cpKOI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635851211586/oKuLHKZJB.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ox4cpKOI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635851211586/oKuLHKZJB.png" alt="Solution Challenge GDSC" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to hosting events and conducting hackathons, an integral part is the hands-on experience. GDSCs across the globe are known for creating impact among society. A GDSC should identify problems in their university or local community which could be solved via technology. One example to solving a university problem could be to build an online proctoring software, or automatic attendance system, or automation of daily tasks custom-built according to the needs of the university. Apart from these, GDSCs can host demo days, where they display the projects built by the teams of their club and also participate in the annual solution challenge. Read in-depth about this amazing global challenge  &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#3-how-can-i-apply-to-become-a-google-developer-student-club-lead-at-my-campus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. How can I apply to become a Google Developer Student Club Lead at my campus?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t8finO4r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635854403775/XJVeJjdG3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t8finO4r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635854403775/XJVeJjdG3.png" alt="Become a Google Developer Student Club Lead at your campus" width="880" height="263"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications to apply for becoming a lead, opens once every year depending on the region you belong from.  You can view the timeline and apply to become a lead  &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc/leads"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-the-google-developer-student-clubs-lead-application-form-2021"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. The Google Developer Student Clubs Lead Application Form 2021
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---lfmR2cB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635854449803/ghpYXd_Y5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---lfmR2cB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635854449803/ghpYXd_Y5.png" alt="The Google Developer Student Clubs Lead Application Form 2021" width="880" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you apply to become a lead, it redirects you to Advocu where you fill out your application to become a lead. You've to fill out your basic details, share links to your work and account on Facebook, Github, LinkedIn, Medium, Qwiklabs, Stack Overflow, Twitter, Portfolio, and website link(if any). I strongly recommend you to build a strong profile on these platforms and be actively engaging, sharing your knowledge with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then comes the 3 major questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your motivation to run a Google Developer Student Club at your College?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your experience in leading a project or a team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What technology do you find most interesting and why? What is your experience with this technology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please tailor these questions according to &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; skills, experience, and expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't take model answers or points from other applicants &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be real&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always proofread and use a Grammar tool, such as Grammarly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have keywords in your answers. If technology is asked, mention all the names of technologies you have working knowledge on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be active in leading clubs/communities from the very beginning. Experience proves your leadership, communication, and community building skills rather than plainly stating it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mention statistics where necessary. Example: In the Technical Carnival conducted in our college last year, we had a total of 600 active participants. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned earlier, have a strong online presence and community contribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, you've to record a 90-second video and show us why you are the right person to be a GDSC Leader at your College&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose the best points and practice beforehand.  You don't need to have a professional mic, camera, or edit videos in order to get selected. Make sure you are perfectly audible and visible. You can also choose to display your points in a presentation but make sure you are visible in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-timeline-for-gdsc-selection-2021-and-the-interview-experience"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Timeline for GDSC Selection 2021 and the Interview Experience
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had applied to become a GDSC Lead on 20th April 2021, the deadline being 11th May, 2021.  After applying, you get a mail with the subject, Thank you for applying [Developer Student Clubs Application Process - Sai Ashish Konchada]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tMi8Zxu1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635840806946/YuvSjAxdm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tMi8Zxu1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635840806946/YuvSjAxdm.png" alt="Thank you for applying Developer Student Clubs Application Process - Sai Ashish Konchada" width="502" height="493"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get shortlisted among the application process, you get an email with the title, Next Steps [DSC Application Process - Sai Ashish Konchada]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mptHpZm8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635854544528/Mfr4iGIBO.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mptHpZm8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635854544528/Mfr4iGIBO.png" alt="Next Steps DSC Application Process - Sai Ashish Konchada" width="501" height="797"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scheduled an interview call for May 18th. The interview lasted for 15 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and created a friendly atmosphere by mentioning to treat it as a discussion rather than an interview. To the best of my memory, a few of the questions were to talk about myself, the GDSC program, my previous community experiences, my plans for GDSC. If any lead is reading this, I urge them to share their interview experience too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 15, I received an email - [Google Developer Student Clubs] Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QZ9Qgcot--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635841907672/ip8IX2mUd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QZ9Qgcot--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1635841907672/ip8IX2mUd.png" alt="Google Developer Student Clubs Congratulations Mail" width="502" height="709"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I got selected as the Google Developer Student Clubs Lead for my campus! As per the instructions, I acknowledged my confirmation and began laying the foundation of  &lt;a href="https://gdsc.community.dev/shree-l-r-tiwari-college-of-engineering-thane/"&gt;GDSC SLRTCE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's a wrap! I hope this blog post finds an aspiring lead, answers his/her doubts, and gains insights about the Google Developer Student Clubs Program. If you've any queries, drop them down in the comment section below and I'll try to answer it as soon as I can. Until the next one, cheers to learning 🥂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi developers, I am Yash Makan and this is not the kind of post where I will tell you guys something which will help you in any way. But before clicking the back button, I would like you to stay. First I would like to tell you a little story... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Yash Makan a 17yo boy living in a small city in India, it all started in the year 2018 when I first stepped on this beautiful journey. It’s been 4 years of dedication, motivation and belief that I am here. This year I got my very first job as a full-stack app developer &amp;amp; I am loving it. For next year, I’ve decided to move and live independently on my own. I would like to embark on this journey of life and take full responsibility for myself. I love my parents and to be quite honest they are sad that I have to leave so early but they completely believe in me and that’s what makes me motivated. I’ve decided to skip the college education(BTech) and learn on my own and help the community as I learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am simply telling you this because I want you guys to take the step not from next year but from today itself. I want that everyone should do stuff whatever they love or their gut tells. I know that there will be difficulties in the path but It’ll all pass away and the rest will be happiness for you and your loved ones. I hope you all the very best and wish you everything you need from life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace ✌🏼&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, I want to thank you guys for your support &amp;amp; love. I love to be a part of the community and my only regret is that I should have joined early on. I cannot believe what I’ve achieved in the past 1.5 months and it’s all because of you guys, so THANK YOU! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data visualisation with React and Nivo</title>
      <author>Damian Piwowarczyk</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 09:00:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/przpiw/build-data-visualisation-components-with-react-and-nivo-1d7e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/przpiw/build-data-visualisation-components-with-react-and-nivo-1d7e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I will walk you though how you can build interactive charts on your website with Nivo &amp;amp; React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-nivo-and-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Nivo and why?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nivo is an open-source React visualization library built on top of d3js. It allows for server-side rendering and supports svg, canvas, and HTML charts. Nivo provides 27 highly customizable char types. It has nice motion and trasitions and it is very responsive. Nivo documentation is developer-friendly and contains many examples/templates and storybooks.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
In this tutorial, we will build &lt;strong&gt;PieChart&lt;/strong&gt; that takes data from a file and renders SVG pie chart. We'll be able to change our chart based on selected values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6o5QMt3z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d900ic4gi5jldy1kitgu.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6o5QMt3z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d900ic4gi5jldy1kitgu.gif" alt="Image final product" width="880" height="880"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We going to use nextjs starter for this application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app statsViewer &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;statsViewer &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;data.js &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;components &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;PieCharDemo.jsA
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add @nivo/core
yarn add @nivo/pie
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imported &lt;code&gt;ResponsivePie&lt;/code&gt; component will take a large number of props as it needs specific styling and file with data. Except that the parent component will need a height and width set.&lt;br&gt;
Beyond props used in this example, there is a bunch of other props that let us do pretty styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's edit &lt;code&gt;PieChartDemo.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ResponsivePie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;@nivo/pie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PieChartDemo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;500px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ResponsivePie&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;padAngle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cornerRadius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeOuterRadiusOffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

              &lt;span class="na"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="na"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="na"&gt;itemTextColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;code&gt;data.js&lt;/code&gt; file that I look created based on data from hashnode. I took numbers and convert them to percentages instead. &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalFollowers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;594.2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalMostPopularPosts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;434&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;convertToPercent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toFixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;tagsByNumOfFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;General Programing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;convertToPercent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;228.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;convertToPercent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;100.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Dev Blogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;convertToPercent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;totalMostPopularPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Lastly we import our PieChartDemo component and fed it with data. I used useState hook and wired it to select input so we rerender PieChart component and feed it other data.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../styles/Home.module.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyResponsivePie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../components/MyResponsivePie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;../data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSelected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tagsByNumOfFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setSelected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tagsByNumOfFollowers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tags&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;followed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;mostPopularPostsThisWeek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;popular&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;week&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyResponsivePie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;To conclude, Nivo is a great library that has many components with out-of-the-box templates and rich documentation. The number of props maybe look overwhelming especially for beginners however, it gives us developers the power of customization that other chart libraries may be limited to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article was helpful to some of you guys. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#javascript-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  JavaScript Functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are an integral part of many programming languages, and JavaScript is not an exception. In JavaScript, &lt;code&gt;functions&lt;/code&gt; are the first-class citizens. You create them, assign them as a value, pass them as arguments to other functions, also return them as a value from a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These flexibilities help in code reusability, clean code, and composability. Today we will learn about &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order Functions&lt;/code&gt; to use functions to their full potential in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to learn from video content as well, this article is also available as a video tutorial here: 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0Lw9eNuUJI"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't forget to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/tapasadhikary?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; for the future content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-higherorder-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are Higher-Order Functions?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order Function&lt;/code&gt; is a regular function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as a value from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a function that takes a function as an argument.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Define a function that takes a function as an argument.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCapture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Invoke the passed function&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Invoke the function by passing a function as an argument&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCapture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Canon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let us take another function that returns a function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Define a function that returns a function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Take the returned function in a variable.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Now invoke the returned function.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logs 'Hi' in the console&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Alternatively - A bit odd syntax but good to know&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()();&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logs 'Hi' in the console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of the examples above are examples of Higher-Order functions. The functions &lt;code&gt;getCapture()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;returnFunc()&lt;/code&gt; are Higher-Order functions. They either accept a function as an argument or return a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note, it is not mandatory for a &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order function&lt;/code&gt; to perform both accepting an argument and returning a function. Performing either will make the function a Higher-Order function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-use-higherorder-functions-how-to-create-higherorder-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why use Higher-Order Functions? How to create Higher-Order Functions?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we understand what a Higher-Order function is. Now, let us understand why we need one and how to create it? How about doing it with a few simple examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem-code-pollution-and-smell"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem: Code Pollution and Smell
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take an array of numbers,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let's write code to increment each array element by a number and return the modified array. You may think about writing it as a function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;incrArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Iterate through each elements and&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// add the number&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if we do,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;incrArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;14, 5, 52]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great so far. Now, if I ask you to write code to decrement each of the elements of the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; array by a number and return the modified array? You may think about solving it in a couple of straightforward ways. First, you can always write a function like,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;decrArr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that's lots of code duplication. We have written almost every line of the &lt;code&gt;incrArr()&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;code&gt;decrArr()&lt;/code&gt; function. So, let's think about the reusability here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you may want to optimize the code to have one single function performing both these operations conditionally.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;doOperations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;op&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;op&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;op&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;decr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, now we rely on a third argument to decide if the operation is to increment or decrease the array's number. There is a problem too. What if I ask you to multiply each element of an array by a number now? You may think about adding another &lt;code&gt;else-if&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;doOperations()&lt;/code&gt; function. But that's not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every new operation, you need to change the logic of the core function. It makes your function polluted and will increase the chance of &lt;code&gt;code smells&lt;/code&gt;. Let's use the &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order&lt;/code&gt; function to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-solution-higherorder-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Solution: Higher-Order Function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is create &lt;a href="https://blog.greenroots.info/what-are-pure-functions-and-side-effects-in-javascript"&gt;pure functions&lt;/a&gt; for the increment and decrement operations. These functions are supposed to do only one job at a time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Increment the number by another number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Decrement the number by another number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;decr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we will write the &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order function&lt;/code&gt; that accepts a function as an argument. In this case, the passed function will be one of the pure functions defined above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;smartOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;operation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Check is the passed value(pad) is not a number.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// If so, handle it by assigning to the zero value.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;isNaN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;operation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Please observe the above function closely. The first parameter is the array to work on. The second parameter is the operation itself. Here we pass the function directly. The last parameter is the number that you want to increament or decerement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's invoke the function to increment array elements by three.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;smartOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;incr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;15, 6, 53]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How about trying the decrement operation now?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;smartOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;decr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;10, 1, 48]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Did you notice that we didn't make any changes to our function to accommodate a new operation this time? That's the beauty of using the Higher-Order function. Your code is smell-free and pollution-free. So, how do we accommodate a multiplication operation now? Easy, let's see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a function to perform multiplication.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, invoke the Higher-Order function by passing the multiplication operation function, &lt;code&gt;mul()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;smartOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;mul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Output,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;36, 9, 150]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's incredible. Long live &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order functions&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inbuilt-higherorder-functions-in-javascript"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In-built Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, there are plenty of usages of higher-order functions. You may be using them without knowing them as Higher-Order functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, take the popular Array methods like, &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt;, and many more. All these functions take another function as an argument to apply it to the elements of an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; method that filters the array elements based on the condition we pass to it as part of the function argument.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [8, 90]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#higherorder-functions-vs-callback-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Higher-Order Functions vs Callback functions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always some confusion between the Higher-Order functions and callback functions. Higher-Order Functions(HoF) and Callback Functions(CB) are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher-Order Functions(HoF): A function that takes another function(s) as an argument(s) and/or returns a function as a value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Callback Functions(CB): A function that is passed to another function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the &lt;code&gt;Higher-Order function&lt;/code&gt; is a fundamental concept built in the JavaScript language. We need to find opportunities to leverage it as much as possible in our coding practices. Higher-Order function in conjunction with the pure function will help you keep your code clean and side effects free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will leave you with this article on &lt;code&gt;Pure Function&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Side Effects&lt;/code&gt; in JavaScript. I hope you enjoy reading it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Things to Know Before You Start Tailwind CSS</title>
      <author>Kaushal Joshi</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 08:32:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/clumsycoder/things-to-know-before-you-start-tailwind-css-4ebj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/clumsycoder/things-to-know-before-you-start-tailwind-css-4ebj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rising popularity of Tailwind CSS, many of us might jump directly on Tailwind just to catch up with the hype. It won't take them much of their time to realize that it is not like any other traditional CSS framework. They might not even get a full picture of Tailwind and end up hating it thinking it's harder than plain CSS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my attempt to cover everything that you need to know to use Tailwind CSS in your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog focuses on CSS concepts that are essential to know for using Tailwind CSS. It is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a tutorial to get started with it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation"&gt;Official documentation&lt;/a&gt; has covered that part pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#utility-first-frameworks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Utility First Frameworks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason why Tailwind is different from other frameworks is that it is a utility based framework, whereas frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma are component based frameworks. Now, what's the difference?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Component based frameworks provide a set of components that are used by adding predefined classes to HTML elements. For example, Bootstrap has a total of 24 components that we can use by simply adding related classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tailwind CSS on the other hand is a utility framework. It doesn't limit your design by predefined opinionated components but provides powerful building blocks that are useful to create a unique design for your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind achieves this by having a class for every CSS property. Additionally, we can add our valid CSS properties to make a new tailwind class as per our needs. This gives total freedom and flexibility while designing the front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this comes with a cost. Component based libraries don't require you to know much about plain CSS. You refer to the documentation and use the code that you need. Tailwind being a low level utility based framework doesn't work in that way. You need to have a profound understanding of CSS to use Tailwind in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intermediate-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intermediate CSS
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one word that describes CSS - overwhelming. Though Tailwind gives you flexibility and saves time requires to type everything explicitly, your knowledge of plain CSS is considered as the main pre-requisites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sizing-units"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sizing Units
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially, &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt;.  All utility classes use &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; for styling. Tailwind has classes from smallest rem unit  &lt;code&gt;0.125rem&lt;/code&gt; (2px) to all the way up to 24rem. Additionally, you can add units as per your choice in &lt;code&gt;tailwind.config&lt;/code&gt; file (which can be &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; or anything else too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#responsive-design"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Responsive Design
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind is mobile first approach to styling. So whatever you write is suited for the smallest screen size defined while configuring tailwind. By default, the smallest utility class is &lt;code&gt;sm&lt;/code&gt; that sets media query of a minimum width of 640px. You are supposed to mention the breakpoint if you are adding classes for bigger sizes than that.&lt;br&gt;
That's why, knowing about responsive design, sizing units and media queries are a must to create anything eye-pleasing with Tailwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flexbox-amp-grid"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Flexbox &amp;amp; Grid
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating layouts using grid and flexbox classes is easy as compared to traditional ways of using them. However, you might find it confusing because many classes conflict with each other resulting in a single class that is used with both layouts.&lt;br&gt;
I was talking about &lt;code&gt;justify-{value}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;align-{value}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;place-{value}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt;. These classes serve the same purpose for flexbox as well as grid. Having a clear understanding of them would help you to save hours of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-important-concepts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Other Important Concepts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not it; CSS is more than that, and so is Tailwind. Units, responsive design and Flexbox/Grid need a special mention because once you understand how these things work, it won't be difficult for you to use Tailwind with its max out capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, here are a few more things that are good to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS Transition and Transform Property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio"&gt;Aspect Ratios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight"&gt;Preflight&lt;/a&gt;: Tailwind has a set of base styling  practices built on top of &lt;a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize"&gt;modern-normalize&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not mentioning padding, margin, box sizing, float and z-index because I believe that if you don't know how to work with them, you should think about sticking to plain CSS for some more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-to-use-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When to Use Tailwind?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have intermediary experience with plain CSS and know how CSS is supposed to work, you can use Tailwind pretty much anywhere you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your front end stack has a component based library such as react, using tailwind will allow you to use it with its maximum reusability and scalability of Tailwind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-not-to-use-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When NOT to use Tailwind?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not even consider using Tailwind if you don't have intermediate experience with CSS. You might not face issues in the very beginning but as your project gets bigger, it'd get messier and confusing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are building websites with Vanilla JS, you might not use Tailwind at its full potential. Using same class names for every different component would make the code redundant, non-readable and messy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are building prototypes and time/deadline is a major factor, using tailwind will slow you down. Tailwind is best suitable for big projects which give you enough time to focus on design as well as logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, using Tailwind with projects where backend logic or backend services is more important than design must be avoided. Because you'd end up spending more time on design when your focus should be on logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tailwind CSS is a utility based framework so you have to combine multiple utilities and create a component by yourself. That's why knowing about plain CSS is a must. You should have a clear understanding of sizing units, responsive design and media queries. Knowing about conflicting flexbox and grid properties would also save your confusion when you start building projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don't jump to Tailwind if you are not comfortable with plain CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Tailwind when you struggle with fundamentals will only lead to frustrations. But once your fundamentals are clear, no one can stop you from harnessing the full potential of Tailwind CSS! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have scheduled more blogs about starting Tailwind CSS so if you're interested, do subscribe to the newsletter and follow &lt;a href="https://clumsycoder.hashnode.dev/"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you think there's anything that can be improved or added, I am happy to hear your opinion. I am most active on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clumsy_coder"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/7JKaushal"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Designing! 🎨&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>peviitor.ro - diferențierea</title>
      <author>Boga Sebastian Nicolae</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 08:25:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sebiboga/peviitorro-diferentierea-14h2</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sebiboga/peviitorro-diferentierea-14h2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Un &lt;code&gt;motor de cautare&lt;/code&gt; este diferit de platformele de recrutare prezente pe piata muncii in prezent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sa luam cateva elemente si sa mentionam diferențele:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cont-de-utilizator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cont de utilizator
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pentru a avea acces la informatia prezentata de motorul de cautare peviitor.ro &lt;code&gt;nu ai nevoie de un cont de utilizator&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ejobs&lt;/strong&gt;: Pe platforma ejobs ai nevoie de un cont de utilizator. Ei te incurajeaza sa iti creezi un profil care poate deveni in timp CV-ul tau. Diferenta intre ejobs si peviitor.ro este ca acest motor de cautare: &lt;em&gt;peviitor.ro&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;nu are nevoie de datele tale personale&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bestjobs&lt;/strong&gt;: La fel ca si pentru ejobs, ei iti recomanda sa iti creezi un profil - cont de utilizator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIN&lt;/strong&gt;: La fel ca si pentru bestjos si ejobs, si platforma LinkedIN recomanda sa ai un cont de utilizator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cariere.ro&lt;/strong&gt;: La fel ca si pentru ejobs si bestjobs sau LinkedIN, si aceasta platforma te incurajeaza sa iti creezi un profil de utilizator sau un profil de companie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#duplicare-de-continut"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Duplicare de continut
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ai putea fi tentat sa spui ca prin aceasta diferentiere prezentata, ejobs ofera mai mult decat un motor de cautare. Partial adevarat insa, tinand cont de faptul ca pe platforma oamenii de HR &lt;code&gt;trebuie sa re-opereze anunturile de angajare&lt;/code&gt;, duplicand contintul de pe website-ul lor -sectiunea cariere, atunci putem sa reconsideram afirmatia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#informatia-completa"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Informatia completa
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nu toate locurile de munca ale unei companii sunt prezente si pe ejobs sau alte platforme unde oamenii de HR trebuie sa re-opereze manual anuntul de angajare.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;peviitor.ro &lt;code&gt;isi propune sa agregheze absolut toate locurile de munca oferite de o companie&lt;/code&gt; nu doar cateva anunturi. Consideram ca este important sa ai acces la informatia completa. Luam in serios dreptul cetateanului de a fi informat, care este un drept si nu un favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#date-actualizate"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Date actualizate
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cand o oferta de munca expira, adica acel loc de munca este ocupat, prima preocupare a persoanei din HR este sa dezactiveze anuntul de pe website-ul propriu al companiei iar dezactivarea manuala de pe platformele de tip ejobs se face putin mai tarziu. Astfel, avem prezente pe platformele de recrutare oferte de locuri de munca expirate. &lt;br&gt;
In motorul de cautare peviitor.ro &lt;code&gt;vei gasi informatia actualizata&lt;/code&gt;. Cel putin o data pe zi aducem informatiile de pe website-ul companiei si reimprospatam indexul motorului de cautare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#viteza-de-raspuns"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Viteza de raspuns
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tehnologiile pe care le-am ales la implementarea solutiei tehnice ne &lt;code&gt;garanteaza faptul ca timpul de raspuns va fi cel putin surprinzator&lt;/code&gt;. Daca ne uitam la Google - care este un motor de cautare doar ca nu e specializat pe locuri de munca, observam ca aduce sute de mii de raspunsuri in sub o secunda. &lt;br&gt;
Ne-am pus problema: ei cum au reusit? Si tot ce am dezvoltat se invarte in jurul motorului de cautare, indexului si scraperului.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#solutie-open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Solutie OPEN SOURCE
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daca celelalte platforme de recrutare se bazeaza pe un soft proprietar al unei companii, noi, in dezvoltarea motorului de cautare peviitor.ro am dezvoltat solutia tehnica avand in gand solutiile OPEN SOURCE. De ce open source? Pentru ca noi consideram ca toti pot contribui la succesul acestui proiect, cei care vor, desigur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#pretul"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Pretul
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daca pentru companii a publica un anunt de angajare pe ejobs sau bestjobs sau alte platforme de recrutare implica niste costuri, pe platforma &lt;code&gt;peviitor.ro totul este GRATUIT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am prezentat aici cateva dintre aspectele care ne diferentiaza. Mai sunt si altele pe care le vom dezvalui pe masura ce dezvoltam proiectul. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A/B testing with the JAMstack</title>
      <author>Marvin</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 08:03:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mfrachet/ab-testing-with-the-jamstack-22mp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mfrachet/ab-testing-with-the-jamstack-22mp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The JAMstack has been talked about in recent years like a way to create static websites that scales very well in many different ways.&lt;br&gt;
Since it becomes more and more mainstream, it made sense to people to think about how to apply older patterns that we like in this&lt;br&gt;
quite particular context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will share with you &lt;strong&gt;my vision&lt;/strong&gt; of A/B testing (or feature flagging, everything written below may apply to both) using the JAMstack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#but-first-why-do-we-use-the-jamstack"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  But first, why do we use the JAMstack?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamstack.org/"&gt;jamstack.org&lt;/a&gt;, we use it because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's about building &lt;strong&gt;simple static pages&lt;/strong&gt; (HTML files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the job is made at build-time, no potential leak at runtime, it's more &lt;strong&gt;secured&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;static pages are basically HTML files and thus &lt;strong&gt;load very fast&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we benefit from &lt;strong&gt;cheap hosting&lt;/strong&gt; (putting files on a server and there we go)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's &lt;strong&gt;highly scalable&lt;/strong&gt;, just put the files on another machine and scaling is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it already exists great tools to create amazing sites (&lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/"&gt;Gatsbyjs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;Nextjs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/"&gt;etc...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-do-we-use-ab-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why do we use A/B testing?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People use A/B testing to measure which variant of a website is more appreciated by their users. The idea is simply to provide different visual representations of some data and check which one attracts more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--irfewGZz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/ab-tests.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--irfewGZz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/ab-tests.png" alt="Visual representation of two different variants of an A/B tests" width="507" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the visitors of the variant A come more often than the visitors of the variant B, then we can assume that variant A is a more viable solution to represent the data on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-use-ab-testing-in-non-jamstack-applications"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we use A/B testing in non JAMstack applications?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In applications that are not built on top of the JAMstack, the idea is quite straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When opening the application, it will make a request to a remote server to get the different available variants. Then, based on some conditions in the codebase, we are able to display the good variant to the good user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an example of a client-side A/B test written with &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;Reactjs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useABVariant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Preparing the application...&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;variant&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's the A variant!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's the B variant!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we see in the snippet, the code is executed in the user's browser. Also notice &lt;strong&gt;the loading information while the request is pending&lt;/strong&gt; before being able to display the variant content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a tiny sandbox allowing to switch on and off a feature flag to display a new variant of a homepage. When using services like &lt;a href="https://launchdarkly.com/"&gt;LaunchDarkly&lt;/a&gt;, this is exactly the kind of actions you're provided with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-ab-testing-on-the-jamstack-is-different"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why A/B testing on the JAMstack is different?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember one of the main arguments of building on top of the JAMstack is &lt;strong&gt;fast page loading&lt;/strong&gt; (performance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with A/B tests the "standard way", &lt;strong&gt;we need to make an HTTP request to get the different variants&lt;/strong&gt;. Making an HTTP request means that &lt;strong&gt;there is a delay&lt;/strong&gt; between the moment we ask for the variants and the moment we get them back from the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that &lt;strong&gt;making the HTTP request is so critical&lt;/strong&gt; that we can't show anything else than a loading information to the user before resolving the variants and being able to show them the good content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a static environment, we are waiting for a dynamic information to display meaningful information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When A/B testing the "standard way", using runtime information will &lt;strong&gt;make the application performances worse by increasing the time for the displaying the first meaningful content&lt;/strong&gt;. Loading static pages should be "instant" but relying on an HTTP request and an intermediate loading state before displaying the content will take extra time and decrease the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some scenarios, &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; performance score can drop by around &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; points (up to you to determine if it's significant or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that some tools helping building applications using the JAMstack &lt;strong&gt;don't even run JavaScript at all&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that it's not possible to rely on HTTP requests to access remote data at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-make-ab-testing-in-a-jamstack-fashion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to make A/B testing in a JAMstack fashion?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JAMstack is about &lt;strong&gt;building static pages&lt;/strong&gt;. Taking this notion to the extreme, we can imagine creating a dedicated set of static pages for different variants and host them in different places, like for example, different machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FouN6kE3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/machine-ab.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FouN6kE3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/machine-ab.png" alt="Visual representation of two machines hosting two different variants of an A/B test" width="851" height="603"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The machine 1&lt;/strong&gt; owns all the statically generated HTML pages impacted by the variant A and &lt;strong&gt;the machine 2&lt;/strong&gt; owns all of the statically generated HTML pages of the variant B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since pages are statically generated at build time, we can rely on environment variables to display the good variant content:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB_EXPERIMENT_VARIANT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB_EXPERIMENT_VARIANTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;AB_EXPERIMENT_VARIANT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's the A variant!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's the B variant!&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to rely on some kind of proxy to route the different users to one of the two variants and make sure they always see that variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;strong&gt;we can't rely on runtime information to store the variant&lt;/strong&gt;, like an authenticated user id for example. We need to rely on something else. Hopefully, &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies"&gt;HTTP Cookies&lt;/a&gt; exist that allow for a client-server kind of data sharing. We can benefit from them to store the actual variant requested by the user and make sure that they will always get routed to that variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---zS66SKK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/cookie-ab.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---zS66SKK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/cookie-ab.png" alt="Visual representation of a proxy routing an HTTP request to the good machine for an A/B test" width="851" height="1263"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#observations-on-this-approach"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Observations on this approach
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first observations to push upfront is that &lt;strong&gt;we have kept the page loading performances provided by default by the JAMstack&lt;/strong&gt;. We don't have to wait for runtime computations to display content on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second observation is about the tradeoffs we decided to make: we shifted the A/B testing responsibility &lt;strong&gt;closer to the infrastructure layer&lt;/strong&gt;. The proxy has an important role to play in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that we need more "places" to put the different variants: 1 variant corresponds to 1 website that corresponds to 1 set of static pages that should entirely be hosted. &lt;strong&gt;The more we have variants, the more we may pay for hosting&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DJdzBuH---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/all-variants.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DJdzBuH---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/a-b-testing-with-the-jamstack/all-variants.png" alt="A visual representation of a project having 4 different variants" width="880" height="626"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also one side effect that I find positive (but it can feel negative) is that it can be hard to combine multiple A/B experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that we have 2 pages and that we want to run an experiment on both the pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can be a visual representation of these scenarios at the hosting level?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should we create 4 different websites, one for each variant?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should we create N different websites with combinations of variants?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My expectations is that there will be solutions allowing to make A/B testing at the file level itself, and not at that site level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#references"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  References
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;a href=""&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; for hosting your websites, they have a feature called &lt;a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/split-testing/"&gt;Split-testing&lt;/a&gt; that allows for these kind of testing using a branch based approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other references in mind concerning A/B testing or Split Testing on top of the JAMstack, feel free to drop them on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mfrachet"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flow control using JS</title>
      <author>Manu Martinez</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 07:38:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/flow-control-using-js-3f2m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/whitehatdevv/flow-control-using-js-3f2m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's one of the most &lt;strong&gt;important topic&lt;/strong&gt; when you are learning how to &lt;strong&gt;write&lt;/strong&gt; code with &lt;strong&gt;JS&lt;/strong&gt; 🤔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to understand what does it mean, what is exactly &lt;em&gt;flow control&lt;/em&gt;, when your code needs to take a decision about which sentence should be run it's made with &lt;strong&gt;FLOW CONTROL&lt;/strong&gt; 😇. There are different methods to control flow using JS, let's going to see some examples: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#if-else-clause"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  if - else clause
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most &lt;strong&gt;typical&lt;/strong&gt; one, it gives us a lot of control about code execution, we can &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; which code should be run&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// run here is condition is true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// run here is condition is false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;basic syntax&lt;/em&gt; you must use 😁, it's really easy, you have a condition which is evaluated and depending on that you will run one side or &lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;OMG!!&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it gives us a lot of power. Let's try one more example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myMum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Maria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myMum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My mum contains a string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My mum is not a string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you have just seen, this code checks if this &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and run the following sentences according to the condition, &lt;strong&gt;obviously&lt;/strong&gt; this condition is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the you will see &lt;code&gt;My Mum contains a string&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; 😇. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover you are able to evaluate multiple conditions using &lt;code&gt;logic operators&lt;/code&gt;, AND &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and OR &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AND &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;: It means that all the conditions must be true due to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; of the entire condition.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It returns true due to both sides are true.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OR &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;: It means that at least one of the conditions must be true to get a final &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// it returns true due to at least one side is true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It gives us more powerful tools to check multiple conditions using the same &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; clause 🤖&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myMum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Maria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;myMum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My mum contains a string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My mum is not a string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you have just seen, it will print &lt;code&gt;My mum contains a string&lt;/code&gt; because two conditions are true and I have used an &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; logic port. &lt;br&gt;
I recommend you to practise some conditions using JS to &lt;strong&gt;understand better&lt;/strong&gt; ☺️ how to use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#switchcase-clause"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Switch-case clause
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows you to check multiple &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; conditions and take decisions depending on that value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It will run when the conditions is match `valor1` &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valor2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It will run when the conditions is match `valor2` &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valorN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It will run when the conditions is match `valorN` &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// It will run when all the conditions are false&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has a lot of power and bring us the opportunity to check &lt;strong&gt;multiple possible values&lt;/strong&gt; easily, instead, we can use multiple &lt;code&gt;if-else&lt;/code&gt; clauses, but your code will not be legible 🤒. It comes to bring us more &lt;strong&gt;organisation&lt;/strong&gt; when we need to check conditions that can take a lot different values, Let's see an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1 negative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// foo is 0, then the following block will be run&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Break allow us not to run case1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Break allow us not to run case2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, you can run the same for conditions that need to perform the same &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;, let's see an example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;giraffe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;giraffe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Bird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This animal will live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;elephant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This animal will not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you have just seen, we will take the same action if animal math &lt;strong&gt;one of the four&lt;/strong&gt; case exposed 😇.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you have seen how to check conditions and how to make your code take &lt;strong&gt;decisions&lt;/strong&gt; in execution time about possible values of your &lt;strong&gt;expressions&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all for &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; post!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A11y tips: add a skip link</title>
      <author>Carlos Espada</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/carlosespada/a11y-tips-add-a-skip-link-222m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A skip link is &lt;strong&gt;a link located at the beginning of the page and that allows the user to jump directly to certain blocks&lt;/strong&gt; (main content, main search, important asides...) without having to go through all the previous elements that are repeated throughout of the entire site (logo, main navigation...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;especially useful for users who navigate with the keyboard&lt;/strong&gt;, and it can also be an aid for those who navigate using headings or landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several rules to follow to build a good skip link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It must be an internal link (starting with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be the first focusable element on the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May or may not be visible to all users all the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is hidden from startup, it should be visible when you receive the keyboard focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When clicking on it, the focus should move to the target element. For greater security in this behavior, it is better to add &lt;code&gt;tabindex="- 1"&lt;/code&gt; to that target element and thus make it focusable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although all content should be contained in a landmark region, &lt;strong&gt;the skip link can be located outside of any landmark&lt;/strong&gt;. Some validators will flag it as a warning but it is not a violation of the WCAG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see some examples of skip links on the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/"&gt;British Government&lt;/a&gt; page or on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Try navigating with the keyboard from the address bar and see how it behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
