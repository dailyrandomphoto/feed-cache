&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to code. Actually, I have always been interested in learning about computers, my desire to learn code arrived much later. As a student, I had a friend who was studying computer tech, and whenever I had a problem with my computer (be it a software update, hardware issue etc), I would watch him work on it, take mental notes, and the next time something similar occured, I would try to fix it myself. I was so intrigued about all things tech and computers back then that whenever I heard words like "program", "developer", "internet", "code", etc., I felt totally curious and wanted to know more about them. However, as an accounting professional with a hectic work schedule, I had no time to indulge my curiosity about an industry I was so passionate about. Additionally, due to my lack of background in STEM, I thought there was no way I could break into tech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the pandemic, and the lockdown left me with extra time on my hands. I started reading online and I discovered that &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/over-65-percent-of-new-developers-are-self-taught-im-surprised-its-not-100-percent"&gt;lots of developers are self-taught&lt;/a&gt; and (like me) had no formal background in tech. This motivated me greatly, and I realised that maybe there is hope for me after all. So I started researching how to learn to code and while doing that, I heard about &lt;a href="//freecodecamp.org"&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;, and coincidentally ran into &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-code-book-club/"&gt;this article about a virtual meetup for developers to learn together&lt;/a&gt; on Discord. It was amazing that I stumbled upon that post at the time I did, because before then I had never heard of Discord and not long after joining, I learned about the &lt;a href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/06/08/code-in-place-makes-cs-accessible-to-thousands-worldwide/"&gt;Stanford Code in Place&lt;/a&gt; free Python course. It was during the application process for this online class that I first discovered what programming was all about. I don't know if anybody else remembers their first time learning code, but it was so exciting for me, I decided to &lt;a href="https://theconsistentdeveloper.hashnode.dev/learn-in-public-my-first-time-writing-code"&gt;blog about it&lt;/a&gt;. I promised myself I was going to pick up other learning resources at the end of the class to continue my coding journey but that was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to enrolling in the &lt;a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/"&gt;Code-in-Place&lt;/a&gt; course, I created an account on The Odin Project and &lt;a href="//freecodecamp.org"&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; where I started taking basic HTML lessons. However, I took a break once the Python class began, so I could concentrate on the course fully. As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to continue studying web development after the class. However, between my still-exhausting fulltime work schedule and other life dynamics, I never went back to coding. I signed up for courses on &lt;a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/"&gt;PluralSight&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href="https://help.pluralsight.com/help/google"&gt;Google Africa Developer Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; 2020 program but later dropped out because I selected the wrong learning track. My freecodecamp and The Odin Project courses were waiting for me but I kept pushing back my start date, until there were no more days left in 2020, and I realized I had not actually done any coding at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my list of resolutions for this year, learning to code was at the top. The first half of 2021 came and went and I realized I hadn't managed to do as much coding or learning as I really wanted. Other commitments and hindrances kept cropping up - there was always something else I had to do. But I was determined to learn how to code. Each time I receive a newsletter from a developer community (like Hashnode, &lt;a href="https://dev.to/"&gt;Devto&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://code.quora.com/"&gt;Quora code groups&lt;/a&gt;) I've subscribed to, I'm reminded all over again how much I'd like to be a part of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the second half of 2021 approached, it dawned on me that another year was drawing to a close without me accomplishing my dream. I didn't want that, so I decided to make a new plan, which is to commit to learning to code for at least one hour every day. I've been trying out this new plan since mid-July when I finally logged into my &lt;a href="//theodinproject.com"&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt; account again for the first time since leaving it last year. However, because of my tendency to procrastinate and not finish things, I'll be employing a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device"&gt;commitment device&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/"&gt;learn in public&lt;/a&gt; by blogging on what I've learned each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, I have created a series on Hashnode titled &lt;a href="https://theconsistentdeveloper.hashnode.dev/series/what-i-learnt-today"&gt;#mytechjourney&lt;/a&gt; in which I will be documenting what I learn each week. I already drafted five posts on what I've learned since July, however, I wanted to post this article first before publishing them. Having done so now, I'll be publishing every week. 🤞 Now I realize that this is not going to be easy; distractions will arise as usual, and other commitments (work, life, etc.) will require my time, but I intend to see this through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, thanks for reading! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Previously published &lt;a href="https://theconsistentdeveloper.hashnode.dev/how-i-plan-to-learn-to-code-before-2022"&gt;on my blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linux Capabilities Set and Bits</title>
      <author>olaboyejo</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 08:02:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/boyeolowoyeye/linux-capabilities-set-and-bits-f1o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/boyeolowoyeye/linux-capabilities-set-and-bits-f1o</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://dev.to/boyeolowoyeye/linux-capabilities-overview-5dgb"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, the concept of Linux capabilities was introduced. In this post, I will be exploring the capability sets and capability bits in a bit more detail. This is a prelude to future posts that will examine the practical use cases of capabilities in &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dockerd&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fork/execve&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#capabilities-sets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Capabilities Sets
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capabilities are properties of threads (or processes). They have thread-level granularity. Applications also have a concept of capabilities and this will be explored separately in more depth when we investigate the &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt; use cases. A thread has the following capability sets; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#effective-capability-set"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Effective Capability Set
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the set of privileged activities that the kernel performs permission checks on before a thread can accomplish a task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inheritable-capability-set"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Inheritable Capability Set
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capabilities in this set are transferable between parent and child processes after an &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt; system call for privileged programs. This will be discussed in more detail in a future post dealing with &lt;em&gt;fork/clone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt; system calls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#permitted-capability-set"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Permitted Capability Set
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The permitted set serves as a limiting superset for the effective set. The capabilities that are not set in the permitted set cannot be enabled in the effective set except;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The the program file capability set contains the capability in its permitted set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The program it (the thread) is executing is with the set-user-ID-root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also limits the capabilities that can be inherited if the &lt;em&gt;CAP_SETPCAP&lt;/em&gt; capability is not present in a thread's effective capability set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ambient-capability-set"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ambient Capability Set
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capability set is useful when a non privileged thread needs its privileges preserved during an &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt; system call. The ambient capability set allows the transfer of capabilities during the &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt; systems call. They are preserved across a process that is unprivileged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bounded-capability-set"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bounded Capability Set
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This capability set is a limiting superset for capabilities that can be added to the inheritable during an &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt; syscall. It is also a limiting factor for permitted set because its AND'ed to the permitted set during &lt;em&gt;execve&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#threadprocess-capability-sets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Thread/Process Capability Sets
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capability sets attached to a thread or a process can be read from the &lt;em&gt;/proc/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;/status&lt;/em&gt; file where &lt;strong&gt;pid&lt;/strong&gt; is process or task ID. For example to see the capabilities the current process is using, we can run the command below;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/$$/status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;$$&lt;/strong&gt; is a special bash parameter representing the current process so the command below will print the current process ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $$ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file &lt;em&gt;/proc/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;/status&lt;/em&gt; contains a lot more information about the process ID under observation. The screen-dump below is a grep of just the capabilities section of the output of my current shell process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ echo $$
13575
boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ grep Cap /proc/13575/status
CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 0000000000000000
CapEff: 0000000000000000
CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capabilities sets introduced earlier can be seen in the output above. They are in hexadecimal form with each character representing a nibble(four bits). The individual capabilities are bit positions in the 64 bit output for each capability set. Setting the bit(1) in the position enables the respective capability, while clearing it (0), disables the capability for the capability set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangement of the capabilities in the 64 bit data structure is defined in the header file &lt;em&gt;/usr/include/linux/capability.h&lt;/em&gt;. The content of this file is determined by the kernel version so you will find that different kernel versions can have varying levels of support for capabilities. The bit positions are numbered from 0 to the latest supported by the kernel. To check the latest capability supported on a system;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output from my system is shown below. It does not have the &lt;em&gt;CAP_BPF&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CAP_PERFMON&lt;/em&gt; capabilities introduced in Kernel version 5.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ uname -a
Linux hp7940m1 5.4.0-80-generic #90-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 9 22:49:44 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/cap_last_cap 
37
boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;cap_last_cap&lt;/em&gt; file output of 37 means that the kernel has support for positions 0 - 37 which means that 38 capabilities are supported. This can be seen in the capability bounding set for the current shell process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CapBnd: 0000003fffffffff
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An examination of the values shown there are nine f(1111 in binary) characters and one 3(11 in binary) character. That gives 36(9X4) + 2 ones which means there are 38 bit positions set which is all the capabilities supported on the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see a human readable translation of the hexadecimal representation, you can use the &lt;em&gt;capsh&lt;/em&gt; utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$ capsh --decode=0x0000003fffffffff
0x0000003fffffffff=cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read
boye@hp7940m1:~/Documents/dev/capabilities_show$    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output above shows the capabilities enabled in the capability bounding set  for the current shell process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the foregoing, we have enough background to see the practical applications of capabilities. We will start that examination with &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing Domain Driven Design: Part III</title>
      <author>Salah Elhossiny</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 07:53:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/salah856/implementing-domain-driven-design-part-iii-pe8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/salah856/implementing-domain-driven-design-part-iii-pe8</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#business-logic-in-entities-requiring-external-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Business Logic in Entities Requiring External Services
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simple to implement a business rule in an entity method when the business logic only uses the properties of that entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the business logic requires to query database or use any external services that should be resolved from the dependency injection system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Remember; Entities can not inject services! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common ways of implementing such a business logic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implement the business logic on an entity method and get external dependencies as parameters of the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a Domain Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain Services will be explained later. But, now let's see how it can be implemented in the entity class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Example: Business Rule: Can not assign more than 3 open issues to a user concurrently &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jz25aHsf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7b0misvijlzutn4zjaaf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Jz25aHsf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7b0misvijlzutn4zjaaf.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AssignedUserId property setter made private. So, the only way to change it to use the AssignToAsync and CleanAssignment methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AssignToAsync gets an AppUser entity. Actually, it only uses the user.Id, so you could get a Guid value, like userId. However, this way ensures that the Guid value is Id of an existing user and not a random Guid value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;IUserIssueService is an arbitrary service that is used to get open issue count for a user. It's the responsibility of the code part (that calls the AssignToAsync) to resolve the IUserIssueService and pass here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AssignToAsync throws exception if the business rule doesn't meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if everything is correct, AssignedUserId property is set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method perfectly guarantees to apply the business logic when you want to assign an issue to a user. However, it has some problems: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes the entity class depending on an external service which makes the entity complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes hard to use the entity. The code that uses the entity now needs to inject IUserIssueService and pass to the AssignToAsync method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#repositories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Repositories
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Repository is a collection-like interface that is used by the Domain and Application Layers to access to the data persistence system (the database) to read and write the Business Objects, generally the Aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common Repository principles are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deﬁne a repository interface in the Domain Layer (because it is used in the Domain and Application Layers), implement in the Infrastructure Layer (EntityFrameworkCore project in the startup template).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not include business logic inside the repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repository interface should be database provider / ORM independent. For example, do not return a DbSet from a repository method. DbSet is an object provided by the EF Core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create repositories for aggregate roots, not for all entities. Because, sub-collection entities (of an aggregate) should be accessed over the aggregate root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Do Not Include Domain Logic in Repositories &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this rule seems obvious at the beginning, it is easy to leak business logic into repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Example: Get inactive issues from a repository &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7THuv6G0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9w07ijbmv11tqsm9jzc2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7THuv6G0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9w07ijbmv11tqsm9jzc2.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIssueRepository extends the standard IRepository&amp;lt;...&amp;gt; interface by adding a GetInActiveIssuesAsync method. This repository works with such an Issue class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see the implementation to understand it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IR456m_b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rnjb18wwg1uboway2qr5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IR456m_b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rnjb18wwg1uboway2qr5.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Used EF Core for the implementation. See the EF Core integration document to learn how to create custom repositories with the EF Core.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we check the GetInActiveIssuesAsync implementation, we see a business rule that deﬁnes an in-active issue: The issue should be open, assigned to nobody, created 30+ days ago and has no comment in the last 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an implicit deﬁnition of a business rule that is hidden inside a repository method. The problem occurs when we need to reuse this business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say that we want to add an bool IsInActive() method on the Issue entity. In this way, we can check activeness when we have an issue entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see the implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wq0TPgAs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ppgchfp1hkzq96jgvq4i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wq0TPgAs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ppgchfp1hkzq96jgvq4i.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to copy/paste/modify the code. What if the deﬁnition of the activeness changes? We should not forget to update both&lt;br&gt;
places. This is a duplication of a business logic, which is pretty dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good solution to this problem is the Speciﬁcation Pattern!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#speci%EF%AC%81cations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Speciﬁcations
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A speciﬁcation is a named, reusable, combinable and testable class to ﬁlter the Domain Objects based on the business rules. ABP Framework provides necessary infrastructure to easily create speciﬁcation classes and use them inside your application code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's implement the in-active issue ﬁlter as a speciﬁcation class: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FH7ov5dm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4r6k86wzohmctpu4pkd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FH7ov5dm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w4r6k86wzohmctpu4pkd.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speciﬁcation base class simpliﬁes to create a speciﬁcation class by deﬁning an expression. Just moved the expression here, from the repository. Now, we can re-use the InActiveIssueSpeciﬁcation in the Issue entity and EfCoreIssueRepository classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using within the Entity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speciﬁcation class provides an IsSatisﬁedBy method that returns true if the given object (entity) satisﬁes the speciﬁcation. We can re-write the Issue.IsInActive method as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hOEcp6OS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6l5r85vzsba3frzhvdt9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hOEcp6OS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6l5r85vzsba3frzhvdt9.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just created a new instance of the InActiveIssueSpeciﬁcation and used its IsSatisﬁedBy method to re-use the expression deﬁned by the speciﬁcation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-with-the-repositories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using with the Repositories
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, starting from the repository interface:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J15gvybA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/50vfielyv2o5aivnnnw6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--J15gvybA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/50vfielyv2o5aivnnnw6.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renamed GetInActiveIssuesAsync to simple GetIssuesAsync by taking a speciﬁcation object. Since the speciﬁcation (the ﬁlter) has been moved out of the repository, we no longer need to create different methods to get issues with different conditions (like GetAssignedIssues(...), GetLockedIssues(...), etc.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated implementation of the repository can be like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qyPg2SfP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1wdusqprthwutr7u1e6i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qyPg2SfP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1wdusqprthwutr7u1e6i.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since ToExpression() method returns an expression, it can be directly passed to the Where method to ﬁlter the entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can pass any Speciﬁcation instance to the GetIssuesAsync method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dyB8qH6r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f1mrj0wz7m3hvu27g7ko.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dyB8qH6r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f1mrj0wz7m3hvu27g7ko.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#with-default-repositories"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  With Default Repositories
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, you don't have to create custom repositories to be able to use speciﬁcations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard IRepository already extends the IQueryable, so you can use the standard LINQ extension methods over it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bdoZKwIQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/01e6dq2hnfwt8l8w8pyx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bdoZKwIQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/01e6dq2hnfwt8l8w8pyx.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AsyncExecuter is a utility provided by the ABP Framework to use asynchronous LINQ extension methods (like ToListAsync here) without depending on the EF Core NuGet package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#combining-the-speci%EF%AC%81cations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Combining the Speciﬁcations
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One powerful side of the Speciﬁcations is they are combinable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume that we have another speciﬁcation that returns true only if the Issue is in a Milestone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WXFgjmgc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pglafxq91iuuecbzmlmx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WXFgjmgc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pglafxq91iuuecbzmlmx.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Speciﬁcation is parametric as a difference from the InActiveIssueSpeciﬁcation. We can combine both speciﬁcations to get a list of inactive issues in a speciﬁc milestone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cNXnobb8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/njexp10xp3xitqjneydn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cNXnobb8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/njexp10xp3xitqjneydn.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example above uses the And extension method to combine the speciﬁcations. There are more combining methods are available, like Or(...) and AndNot(...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#domain-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Domain Services
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain Services implement domain logic which: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depends on services and repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs to work with multiple aggregates, so the logic doesn't properly ﬁt in any of the aggregates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain Services work with Domain Objects. Their methods can get and return entities, value objects, primitive types... etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they don't get/return DTOs. DTOs is a part of the Application Layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Example: Assigning an issue to a user &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how an issue assignment has been implemented in the Issue entity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5CVJQmfT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p7k1kbwrgpa6wt22ustt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5CVJQmfT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p7k1kbwrgpa6wt22ustt.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we will move this logic into a Domain Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, changing the Issue class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SNimynQ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cxjg4iii8ysuid0k0pvm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SNimynQ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cxjg4iii8ysuid0k0pvm.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removed the assign-related methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changed AssignedUserId property's setter from private to internal, to allow to set it from the Domain Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to create a domain service, named IssueManager, that has AssignToAsync to assign the given issue to the given user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nftg-usk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yzbvkqiris7o08tvfv3x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nftg-usk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yzbvkqiris7o08tvfv3x.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IssueManager can inject any service dependency and use to query open issue count on the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem of this design is that Issue.AssignedUserId is now open to set out of the class. However, it is not public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is internal and changing it is possible only inside the same Assembly, the IssueTracking.Domain project for this example solution. We think this is reasonable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domain Layer developers are already aware of domain rules and they use the IssueManager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application Layer developers are already forces to use the IssueManager since they don't directly set it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a tradeoff between two approaches, we prefer to create Domain Services when the business logic requires to work with external services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Example: Assigning an issue to a user &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e6O7d1KO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00n5hdkchnzsvwjiinjg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e6O7d1KO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/00n5hdkchnzsvwjiinjg.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An application service method typically has three steps those&lt;br&gt;
are implemented here;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the related domain objects from database to implement the use case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use domain objects (domain services, entities, etc.) to perform the actual operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the changed entities in the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-transfer-objects"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data transfer Objects
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DTO is a simple object that is used to transfer state (data) between the Application and Presentation Layers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Application Service methods gets and returns DTOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Common DTO Principles &amp;amp; Best Practices &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DTO should be serializable, by its nature. Because, most of the time it is transferred over network. So, it should have a parameterless (empty) constructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should not contain any business logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never inherit from or reference to entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input DTOs (those are passed to the Application Service methods) have different natures than Output DTOs (those are returned from the Application Service methods). So, they will be treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input DTO Best Practices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not Deﬁne Unused Properties for Input DTOs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deﬁne only the properties needed for the use case! Otherwise, it will be confusing for the clients to use the Application Service method. You can surely deﬁne optional properties, but they should effect how the use case is working, when the client provides them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule seems unnecessary ﬁrst. Who would deﬁne unused parameters (input DTO properties) for a method? But it happens, especially when you try to reuse input DTOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not Re-Use Input DTOs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deﬁne a specialized input DTO for each use case (Application Service method). Otherwise, some properties are not used in some cases and this violates the rule deﬁned above: Do not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deﬁne Unused Properties for Input DTOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it seems appealing to reuse the same DTO class for two use cases, because they are almost same. Even if they are same now, they will probably become different by the time and you will come to the same problem. Code duplication is a better practice than coupling use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of reusing input DTOs is inheriting DTOs from&lt;br&gt;
each other. While this can be useful in some rare cases, most of the time it brings you to the same point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RTDyhBQT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/of6cps5nyj37p6pfg0lv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RTDyhBQT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/of6cps5nyj37p6pfg0lv.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IUserAppService uses UserDto as the input DTO in all methods (use cases). UserDto is deﬁned below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QFK2fBQA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ouurgz4ga35ih1ereaj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QFK2fBQA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0ouurgz4ga35ih1ereaj.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Id is not used in Create since the server determines it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Password is not used in Update since we have another method for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CreationTime is never used since we can't allow client to send the Creation Time. It should be set in the server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A true implementation can be like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a-tmNEuN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8lbzt0vggw97qh8foo9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a-tmNEuN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q8lbzt0vggw97qh8foo9.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the given input DTO classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9AbR-eVA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3qv39o58wf8c5qfibytj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9AbR-eVA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3qv39o58wf8c5qfibytj.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input DTO Validation Logic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implement only formal validation inside the DTO. Use Data Annotation Validation Attributes or implement IValidatableObject for formal validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not perform domain validation. For example, don't try to check unique username constraint in the DTOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Using Data Annotation Attributes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---SgCpu-P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u9ag3x2q5chshavrfo84.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---SgCpu-P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u9ag3x2q5chshavrfo84.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABP Framework automatically validates input DTOs, throws AbpValidationException and returns HTTP Status 400 to the client in case of an invalid input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Output DTO Best Practices &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep output DTO count minimum. Reuse where possible (exception: Do not reuse input DTOs as output DTOs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output DTOs can contain more properties than used in the client code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return entity DTO from Create and Update methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Returning Different DTOs from different methods&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SGgPOebc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kpksezv4t53cj2300bgj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SGgPOebc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kpksezv4t53cj2300bgj.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example code above returns different DTO types for each&lt;br&gt;
method. As you can guess, there will be a lot of code&lt;br&gt;
duplications for querying data, mapping entities to DTOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IUserAppService service above can be simpliﬁed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d_VyUlcI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kyz54wbict5gwd0qrc1q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d_VyUlcI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kyz54wbict5gwd0qrc1q.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a single output DTO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DhfzBiYC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xbt6udkz4j2f2nen91g8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DhfzBiYC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xbt6udkz4j2f2nen91g8.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removed GetUserNameAndEmail and GetRoles since Get method already returns the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GetList now returns the same with Get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create and Update also returns the same UserDto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>You don't know useEffect</title>
      <author>Trung Hieu Nguyen</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 07:29:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/trunghieu99tt/you-don-t-know-useeffect-4j9h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/trunghieu99tt/you-don-t-know-useeffect-4j9h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;useEffect is one of the most common React Hooks which every ReactJS developer should know. But using useEffect the right way is not easy as you might think. Today, I will go through some notes which I think many newbies go wrong when using useEffect and solution to get rid of those issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-quick-overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Quick overview
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we should start with some basics about useEffect. We all know that useEffect is a React Hook which is used to handle side effects function (for who doesn't know what's a side effect function - it's just a function that interacts with the outside world. I.e: Log something to screen, create a file, save data to database, change DOM....). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know about React lifecycle, useEffect will do the job of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount. Yes, 3 methods in 1 hook. Therefore, the use cases of useEffect will be use cases of those above methods: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do something when state/props change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning stuffs on unmount / before next render&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more than that....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax: The syntax of useEffect is very simple:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deps_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first argument will be a side effect function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second argument will be an array of dependencies which determine whether that useEffect would run or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-dive-deep-into-useeffect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Dive deep into useEffect.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-forms-of-useeffect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  a. Forms of useEffect
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we'll talk about 3 forms of useEffect. I don't know if it's right to call "form", but at least it makes sense to me (hope it will make sense to you guys too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form of useEffect is determined by the second argument: array of dependencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the deps_arrray is optional, you aren't forced to pass the second argument. In case if only pass the first argument, we have the first form of useEffect&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, the function passed to useEffect will run on every render of the component. It's used when you need to do something on every render of the component. But you should be careful when use this form of useEffect if you don't want to mess up with infinity render or memory leak. You should avoid using this form of useEffect as much as possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This effect is called on every render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return..&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everytime your component is re-rendered, you will see that log. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pass an empty array as second argument of useEffect, you will have the second form of it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's opposite with the first form, the function passed to useEffect will run only one time (after the first render). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Effect has been called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Except for the first render, you won't see the log "Effect has been called" anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third form of useEffect is when you pass array with some variable in the array of dependencies&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;variableA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;varibleB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,...]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, func will be run every time there's a change with any element in array of dependencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCounter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This will run every time counter changed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;counter: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;⚠️ There's a thing you need to notice: Even if you pass an array of dependencies or not, and you just intend to run the function in the third form of useEffect when one of the dependencies changes,  the useEffect will always run on the first time component is mounted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;run only once&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Change a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Change b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the first render, you'll see three logs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;once&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;change&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So even though a and b aren't changed at all, those useEffect associated with those variables still run on the first render. This will be a big deal if you have multi useEffect that triggers some side effect that are heavy (i.e: API call). For example, you have to render a list with pagination and search query&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./styles.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;call api first time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Call api when query changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Call api when page changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time your component is mounted, you will see three logs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;changes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;changes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine if you listen to changes of many other fields and on each of useEffect for those fields, you trigger API calls (or any other side effect function), so for the first time your app is rendered, a lot of unnecessary API calls will be triggered which can affect the performance of your app and cause some bugs that you might not expect (in case you don't really need to fire all API call or side effects function of all useEffect) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get rid of that issue, there're some ways, but I will introduce to you guys the common way - which's my favorite one to deal with that problem. You can create a variable to check if component is mounted or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isMounted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isMounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Call api when query changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isMounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Call api when page changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;call api first time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;isMounted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the result on first mount&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also notice about the order of useEffect, I didn't put them in that order for nothing. In order to make that solution works, you must put the variable that holds value for the first render/mount (or whatever you want to call it) in last useEffect.  React goes through useEffects in order&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#b-dependencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  b. Dependencies
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, I mentioned the list of dependencies passed to useEffect, by doing that, you can "listen" to any change of each element in the dependency list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that : most of the time you will work with object and function, if you pass variable with object/function type to dependency list, sometimes your program might work not as you expected. Let's consider the below example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;list changed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is a random function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Use effect of someFunc's called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fakeList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;number 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;number 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"App"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Variable a: &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Increase a&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;call someFunc()&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fakeList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, try click button "Increase a",&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will get this (not in the first render)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;changed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s called
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each time we click "Increase a" the useEffect listen to changes of someFunc and list are triggered,  even though we didn't touch or change someFunc, fakeList (Notice that I wrapped List component with memo to prevent it from re-rendering if props - list changed). It's because when comparing objects/functions, React will compare their references. So when click the button Increate a → App component will be re-rendered (due to change of state) → someFunc and fakeList are renewed , so on each render, someFunc and fakeList will have new references, therefore, React will mark that someFunc and fakeList are changed and run useEffect associated with them. You should care about this thing to prevent unnecessary re-render and unnecessary useEffect trigger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, React will compare objects/functions by their references. There are 2 common cases that you should count when working with dependencies of type object/function: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case 1: Objects/functions are the same, but the references are different (the case in our example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case 2: Objects have different values, but their references are the same (this case happens when you partially update the object but don't trigger a re-new action).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the above 2 cases will affect our useEffect which leads to unexpected behavior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There're many solutions to avoid those cases, I'll introduce to you guys the approach that I usually use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first case: Memorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, to do that, we will come up with 2 new hooks (maybe you guys heard about it before: useCallback and useMemo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For quick ref, you guys can see the differences of these hooks here: &lt;a href="https://codethisshit.vercel.app/reactjs-interview-questions-part-1#264ff63883964394878fa7834261d338"&gt;The difference between useCallback and useMemo&lt;/a&gt; or read for detail on the official site: &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback"&gt;useCallback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo"&gt;useMemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change our code a little bit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useMemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;list changed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is a random function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Use effect of someFunc's called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fakeList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useMemo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;number 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;number 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"App"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Variable a: &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Increase a&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;call someFunc()&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fakeList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wrapped someFunc with useCallback (actually, if you use someFunc as one of the dependencies of useEffect and don't wrap it by useCallback, in case your IDE/text editor is integrated with ESLint,  you would get a warning like this: The 'someFunc' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 19) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the definition of 'someFunc' in its useCallback() Hook) and also wrap our fakeList with useMemo. Because of studying purpose, we will let the list of dependencies of useCallback and useMemo are blank for now, but in real-life projects, when using these hooks, you should be careful about their dependency list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if we run our program and click the Increase a button. We won't see the log come from useEffect of someFunc and list anymore (except for the first render). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Every line in your code comes with a cost!. useCallback and useMemo will consume the memory of your program (since it needs to store the value somewhere) so you should be careful when using these hooks, only use them when it's really necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second case, I will not give example because the way to get rid of that problem is to simply listen to the attribute not the object. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the best practice with the dependency list of useEffect is that you should always deal with primitive type as long as you can to avoid unexpected result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code for this section can be found here: &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/hopeful-cherry-md0db?file=/src/App.js:356-388"&gt;https://codesandbox.io/s/hopeful-cherry-md0db?file=/src/App.js:356-388&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#c-clean-up-function"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  c. Clean up function
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In overview section, I said that useEffect can do the job of componenWillUnmount life cycle. it's return function in useEffect&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do cleanup stu&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The return function will execute "clean up" stuff before next time function in that useEffect is called. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the above example, it's equivalent to execute some code in componentWillUnmount since the form of useEffect in the above example is #2 which only runs once after the first render of the component. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it's kind of abstract. So we will go through some examples, hope you guys will get it after these examples.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;first render list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;unmount list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a list&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;clean up on change isListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"App"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle List&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isListVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each time you click "Toggle List" you'll see two logs: One from useEffect of form #2 from List and one is from useEffect of #3 listens for change of isListVisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UPFYDxGY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/py934l3n48z4skdgsbwl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UPFYDxGY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/py934l3n48z4skdgsbwl.png" alt="IsListVisible"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why clean up is necessary. So let's consider below example: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's change above example a little bit:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;interval from list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;unmount list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a list&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;clean up on change isListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"App"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;onClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setIsListVisible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Toggle List&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;isListVisible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I added a setInterval to List, it will log every 1 min. But the point here is: even though List is unmounted, the interval will still running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q5z16V-K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pyexabefygm0d0ywpws6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q5z16V-K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pyexabefygm0d0ywpws6.png" alt="setInterval image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the component is unmounted, some side effects we put to that component's still running. In our example, it's just an interval, but in real life, what if it's a bunch of API calls, a bunch of other side effect stuff, imagine that they still run even if their components are unmounted, it's could be a black hole that affects our app performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, to resolve the issue, we could simply add clearInterval to our clean up function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listInterval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;interval from list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;unmount list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;listInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;This is a list&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know that if you're newbie, sometimes you'll not notice about clean up stuffs, but they're really necessary and you should spend time considering about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code for this section can be found here: &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/flamboyant-andras-xo86e?file=/src/App.js:69-357"&gt;https://codesandbox.io/s/flamboyant-andras-xo86e?file=/src/App.js:69-357&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3summary"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3.Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I've gone through some deep information about useEffect. Besides the notes that I mentioned, there're much more cases you should notice when using useEffect to make your app work the best way it could. So keep learning and if you have any questions or corrections, please drop a comment and I will check it out. Thank you. Bye bye. 😈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello folks, if you want to become a Salesforce developer and looking for the best online training courses then you have come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt; is not only that customer relationship management that used by companies to organize their works and keep the workflow up, but it is also a vast platform where developers can use to create apps, develop it, customize it and deploy it on a server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these purposes, Salesforce has launched many certification programs that allow you to learn how this platform work and how to use it, such as the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-crack-salesforce-platform-app-builder-certification-exam.html"&gt;Salesforce Platform App Builder&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-crack-salesforce-administrator-certification.html"&gt;Salesforce Administrator&lt;/a&gt; and the Salesforce Development Training, which is required to become a Salesforce developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce Development Training is a certification that teaches you how to program salesforce apps with a programming language called Apex, which is too similar to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-java-programmer-roadmap-f9db163ef2c2"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; to create the backed of the software and visual-force to create the front-end of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means any business requirement can't be done with simple built-in features; the developer will code that specific requirement. This skill has an average annual salary of $95,423, and one of the top highest paid jobs in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/these-are-the-highest-paying-tech-jobs-programmers-can-aim-to-increase-their-pay-c59e1eeb6904"&gt;IT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/02/top-10-highest-paying-technical-jobs-programmers-software-developers.html"&gt;Software development&lt;/a&gt; in general.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to make Coverage in Golang?</title>
      <author>Francisco Javier Sánchez Fuentes</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 06:28:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fransafu/how-to-make-coverage-in-golang-3je3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fransafu/how-to-make-coverage-in-golang-3je3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we'll to check about coverage in Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can download the &lt;a href="https://github.com/fransafu/coverage-golang-example"&gt;Source code&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions in the README.md.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Run the tests and save the coverage profile in "coverage.out"&lt;/span&gt;
go &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-coverprofile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;coverage.out ./...

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# View the coverage profile in your browser&lt;/span&gt;
go tool cover &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;coverage.out
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#coverage-in-golang"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Coverage in Golang
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, we have to create an &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; entity and store it in memory. This is the structure of the project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
├── README.md
├── cmd
│   └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── internal
    └── user
        ├── storage.go
        ├── storage_test.go
        └── user.go
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-need-to-write-the-program"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  we need to write the program
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to declare the &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; entity, the filename for this is 'user.go' (in the "internal" folder in called &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Package user describe user entity attributes and manage user storage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint64&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;FirstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;LastName&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Age&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="kt"&gt;uint16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now, we have to create the user storage. In the same package, the &lt;code&gt;storage.go&lt;/code&gt; was created with the following structure and methods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStorage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;// Count total users in the database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#we-need-to-test-the-program"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  We need to test the program
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, we have three methods of adding, searching, and counting your own users in storage. But we have to test that, so we add the &lt;code&gt;storage_test.go&lt;/code&gt; file with its test. The following code has three tests that make 100% coverage for UserStorage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user_test&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"testing"&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"github.com/fransafu/coverage-golang-example/internal/user"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TestUserStorage_SaveUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStorage&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FirstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Francisco"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LastName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sanchez"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TestUserStorage_SearchUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LastName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Sanchez"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AddUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FindUserByID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TestUserStorage_EmptySearchUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UserStorage&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FindUserByID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you thinking about improving the tests with "Test Suite" or "Test Group", yes, this is the way, but for now, these examples are simple and atomic for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-the-coverage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get the coverage
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the coverage in a Golang project you can use the "./..." wildcard and the Golang CLI will search for all tests declared in a project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Run the tests and save the coverage profile in "coverage.out"&lt;/span&gt;
go &lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-coverprofile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;coverage.out ./...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, we have the file &lt;code&gt;coverage.out&lt;/code&gt; that contains the coverage information but we need to view the results, the following command line shows the coverage program in the browser.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# View the coverage profile in your browser&lt;/span&gt;
go tool cover &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;coverage.out
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now you can check all files that contain declared tests. If you don't declare a test file, you won't have coverage for that module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's all for now, thanks for reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:)!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 tips to get Your Site Noticed by Search Engines</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are building a production application that you want to be used by real-world users, &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;) plays a pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-seo"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt;?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Engine Optimization&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of improving the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;traffic&lt;/strong&gt; to a website from &lt;strong&gt;Search Engines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more the number of users visiting your website, the more will be the &lt;em&gt;engagement with your content&lt;/em&gt; and the higher the likelihood that it would &lt;em&gt;yield more revenue&lt;/em&gt;. Here are a few tips that can significantly boost your &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; and help you rank higher on any &lt;strong&gt;Search Engine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-meta-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Meta tags
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the easiest one to implement. &lt;strong&gt;Meta Tags&lt;/strong&gt; defines the &lt;em&gt;meta data&lt;/em&gt; for the page and also enables you to add additional details to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EX_QKGL0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hys3cwyy0l01kb43d3i2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EX_QKGL0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hys3cwyy0l01kb43d3i2.png" alt="Additional Info using Meta"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can generate the &lt;strong&gt;Meta Tags&lt;/strong&gt; for your website using any &lt;strong&gt;Meta Tag Generator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some common &lt;strong&gt;Meta Tags&lt;/strong&gt; that you should include are given below. Fill up the details and add them inside the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Basic SEO --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;httpEquiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"cache-control"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"max-age=&amp;lt;age in seconds&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"utf-8"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"theme-color"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;theme color hex&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"keywords"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"comma separated keywords"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;httpEquiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Content-Type"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text/html; charset=utf-8"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"language"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"English"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"description"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"image"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/image-link.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"thumbnail"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/image-link.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"og:type"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"website"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;property=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"og:url"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&amp;lt;url for the website&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-use-semantic-html"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Use Semantic HTML
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another easy one for beginners. Even though picking up &lt;strong&gt;Semantic HTML&lt;/strong&gt; is a tad difficult, once you get the hang of things, using &lt;strong&gt;Semantic HTML&lt;/strong&gt; becomes almost unconscious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common &lt;strong&gt;Semantic HTML&lt;/strong&gt; Tags are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;section&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;strong&gt;section&lt;/strong&gt; tag is used to group the content into different sections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt; tag is used to define the header for a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;nav&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;strong&gt;nav&lt;/strong&gt; element defines a set of navigation links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt;: Just like the &lt;strong&gt;header&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;footer&lt;/strong&gt; tag is used to define the footer for a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;aside&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;strong&gt;aside&lt;/strong&gt; element defines some content aside from the main content (placed in a sidebar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt; element specifies the main content of the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A demo for the tags might be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"brand-logo.png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#sec-1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"#sec-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sec-1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;section&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"sec-2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://ext-1.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;External Link 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://ext-2.com"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;External Link 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-reduce-load-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Reduce Load Time
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; performance killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s----yVoL68--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o6f834o7kcjqn8rj17pr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s----yVoL68--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o6f834o7kcjqn8rj17pr.png" alt="Page Load Bounce Rate"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bounce Rate&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the percent of users who leave the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, &lt;em&gt;the attention span of humans is less than even a goldfish&lt;/em&gt;. As you can see from the above graph, &lt;em&gt;the higher the time required to load the page&lt;/em&gt;, the more likely it is that the &lt;em&gt;users will abandon the page and move on to another website&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reduce the page load time by &lt;strong&gt;Lazy Loading&lt;/strong&gt; less used parts of the page like &lt;strong&gt;Opened Accordions&lt;/strong&gt; and removing anything that slows down your website (and &lt;em&gt;optimizing&lt;/em&gt; the unremovable parts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-use-appropriate-keywords"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Use appropriate keywords
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of every effective &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; strategy is &lt;strong&gt;keyword research&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Search Engines&lt;/strong&gt; use the &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt; to determine which content is relevant to a particular &lt;strong&gt;search query&lt;/strong&gt;, and how the page should rank in searches for a particular term. That's what gives a Web Page its &lt;em&gt;Search Ranking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might be thinking &lt;em&gt;"I will just spam my website with the right keywords"&lt;/em&gt;. Why this might not be a good idea is discussed in the next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-content-is-king"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Content is king
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vPCGVudK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9btg45r27um05n9j43hg.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vPCGVudK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9btg45r27um05n9j43hg.jpg" alt="Content is king"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeting &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt; to improve &lt;strong&gt;Organic Rankings&lt;/strong&gt; no longer works with &lt;strong&gt;Search Engines&lt;/strong&gt;, but choosing the right &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt; is still crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, the &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; has become &lt;strong&gt;Return on Investment&lt;/strong&gt; focused, and even though you do get ranked based on &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt;, ultimately how long your users engage with the content dominates the rank for the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have engaging content, the &lt;strong&gt;Bounce Rate&lt;/strong&gt; will go up and ultimately the ranking of your website will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summing-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summing Up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we went through why &lt;strong&gt;SEO&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial, as well as a few tips to significantly boost your website ranking on &lt;strong&gt;Search Engines&lt;/strong&gt;. Another essential thing to keep in mind is registering your website at &lt;a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/"&gt;Google Search Console&lt;/a&gt;, else &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; won't even be aware that your website exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this you in your new project and you do Get Noticed in the &lt;strong&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am a beginner, how should I learn Front-End Web Dev?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First get the fundamentals of &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CSS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;JS&lt;/strong&gt; down; Learn any &lt;em&gt;front-end framework/library&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Vue&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt;); Then keep making &lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt; or make &lt;strong&gt;Open Source Contributions&lt;/strong&gt; to attain mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
