      <guid>https://dev.to/aparnasharma13/10-tips-to-credibility-for-your-saas-startup-in-2022-mii</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular business opportunities today is Software as a Service (SaaS). When it comes to building a SaaS startup with credibility from the start, it can be difficult to secure a place in the extremely competitive startup environment, as I also belong to a Saas startup that is &lt;strong&gt;Newsdata.io&lt;/strong&gt; which provides &lt;a href="https://newsdata.io/"&gt;news API&lt;/a&gt; services, and we have used many of these tips to improve our brand’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a new SaaS startup doesn’t achieve even a fraction of the credibility of an established business, it could quickly fall into that unfortunate majority. To keep up with the competition, startups need to work quickly to establish their credibility. To help you out, at SaaSworthy we’ve put together a list of the top 10 ways to build credibility as a new SaaS startup in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-a-saas-startup"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is a SaaS startup?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS (Software as a Service) startups are companies that use software to provide a service to their customers. It hosts applications and makes them available to clients via the Internet or a web application, which implies that the software is hosted on a SaaS Boot server and can be accessed remotely by the user. These companies design, develop, host, and update their own products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top 10 ways to build credibility as a new SaaS startup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the top 10 ways to boost your credibility as a new SaaS startup in 2022. Take a close look at them to get a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-make-the-most-of-testimonials"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Make the Most of Testimonials
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using customer testimonials to increase your startup’s credibility is one of the easiest ways to do this. Testimonials are opinions of large companies, specialists, or important figures in your sector. The credibility increases as the expert’s followers notice their reviews of your product and most likely want to try it for themselves. Collect testimonials from internet reviews, social media, and polls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testimonials have a greater impact on the perceived trustworthiness of an online business than trust seals or even the entire reputation of the business. Share as many positive testimonials as possible. Perhaps you could devote an entire page of your business website to customer testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using video testimonials instead of written testimonials. They might also work better because viewers can see the emotion in the influencer’s face and voice and as a result, they trust you more. The more a testimonial is relevant to the objectives and needs of the prospect, the more credibility it will induce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-establish-a-social-media-presence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Establish a Social Media Presence
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to be present where your potential customers are, which is usually on social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Potential clients often use social media to assess the legitimacy of a new startup or SaaS organization. Those who follow you on social media, actively or passively, support your brand by helping you get more people to trust you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a habit of posting regularly and responding to comments and requests from your audience. Plus, enhance your social media pages by writing a compelling bio including your company logo and cover photo, updating your office hours on Facebook and LinkedIn, and sharing your contact details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to gain the trust of your audience, facilitate contact and communication with your organization. Being active on popular social media platforms is extremely crucial. Here you can help customers who contact you and engage them with news and information relevant to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-share-your-accomplishments-and-mentions-in-the-press"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Share your accomplishments and mentions in the press
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your customers know if your SaaS startup has been recognized at an awards ceremony or received positive publicity for a recent event. Share it with interested parties, promote it on your LinkedIn profile, and display your media mentions and awards on your website. These help to build credibility. If the media portrayed you positively, your product is probably trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show your results to everyone. Don’t hesitate to show your customers, suppliers, and employees that you are satisfied with your results and the progress of your business. Highlight accolades or accomplishments on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great strategy for building your media presence is to use free web services to find out about printing opportunities for your agency. They can offer advice to journalists on how to be included in news articles. Whichever way you want to advertise your results, make sure they speak to your trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-get-customer-feedback-on-your-product"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Get customer feedback on your product
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a BrightLocal survey, 57% of customers will only buy from a business with four or more stars. And 90% of them will read 5–10 product reviews online before trusting a business. Positive reviews from past and current consumers are essential for building credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a study, 88% of customers trust online reviews as much as personal advice. Therefore, contact customers directly to ask for detailed feedback on the items they liked and offer them an incentive in return for their time. Look for reviews from happy customers and create a dedicated testimonials page on your website to show potential customers how many satisfied customers your startup has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a review is relevant and clearly demonstrates the benefits of using your product, it is guaranteed to build the trust of readers. It could be much more effective if it’s posted on a third-party site rather than yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-use-guest-blogs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Use Guest Blogs
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building your credibility, internet exposure is your gateway to success. Since building a huge number of subscribers takes time, you can leverage other people’s audiences through guest blogging on their websites. Guest blogging is one of the most effective methods of building your startup’s credibility and showcasing your brand and voice to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guest blogging could help strengthen your startup’s reputation. There are several sites that welcome well-written guest contributions. Start by posting at least one highDA guest post every week and gradually increase the frequency. To increase the number of visitors to your SaaS site, include a CTA in your author profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic from these websites could lead to visibility and leads. Use your professional knowledge to post on other blogs and websites after you have created an intriguing and well-written blog. Provide your readers with information about the industry, product advice, and other things that are helpful or answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-offer-free-trials-for-your-paid-products"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Offer free trials for your paid products
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many customers can understandably be reluctant to trust something that is still in its infancy. Additionally, 92% of customers only believe suggestions from credible sources. Give them a free trial, so they can explore all of your features to welcome them into your party and prove how great you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way when you start downloading they will be better prepared and more secure to buy it. Salesforce offers consumers a 30-day free trial without the need for credit card information or software installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider offering discounts or free products to people who leave positive reviews. You can also attract more customers by offering premium versions of your product that unlock cool features when they pay extra. As a result, Dropbox increased its subscriber base from 100,000 to 400,000 by providing 16GB of storage for free as part of its referral program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-leverage-the-reputation-of-your-partners"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Leverage the reputation of your partners
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably already created a network of trusted people who are associated with your startup and believe in your value offering. You may already have a prestigious management and investor team. use it for the benefit of your startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for ways to showcase the knowledge and connections of people currently associated with your business. You can ask board members to make important phone calls or reports on your account. Invite your close circle of partners to share information about your startup on social networks and promote it on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, offer complete profiles of members of your board of directors and testimonials from important partners on your website and in corporate communications. Don’t limit yourself to the founding team. Overestimating the scope of the collaboration or claiming an endorsement that doesn’t exist are the fastest ways to lose credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-build-highquality-backlinks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Build high-quality backlinks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building high-quality external links is a unique SEO technique that still matters a lot to your online credibility. Getting high-quality backlinks shows buyers that you are trusted by trusted sources. So make an effort to include backlinks to your content from credible and relevant websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this does not have a direct influence on search rankings, it will increase the credibility of your material. Of course, the ideal approach to getting high-quality links is to create high-quality content that provides real added value to readers. Getting backlinks from meaningful link aggregators like sites.gov, .edu, and.org helps increase your website authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-designed landing page should have a CTA that attempts to convert visitors immediately. It is one of the most frequent and effective ways to increase the number of visits to your website. However, adding shoddy and spam links to your content can damage your site’s SEO and cause it to downgrade in search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#9-use-of-trust-seals"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  9. Use of trust seals
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business reliability is one of the most common concerns of customers, and this is especially prevalent with new SaaS startups storing sensitive data in the cloud. , 76% of customers won’t buy anything from a website if they don’t recognize the Trustmark or trust seal. These are often the deciding factors that prevent a prospect from trusting you with their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have seals from companies like McAfee or MasterCard, customers feel comfortable sharing their personal information with you because they know their data is encrypted and all payments are secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a seal of trust on your website or landing page helps build customer trust, but where it is also crucial. Next, make your trust seals visible in important areas like the lead capture form, site header/footer, and gateway checkout page so customers have reassurance every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#10-provide-only-the-best-version-of-your"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. Provide Only the Best Version of Your
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Products If you want to increase your startup’s credibility over the years, you need to build and deliver the best products and services available. Make sure your product or service is of the highest quality. Consumer claim or problem with your product as soon as possible. This way, you can make sure you are providing the best product or service available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for your customer service. You can, indeed, have an A + product, but if you don’t provide courteous, reliable, and knowledgeable customer service, your startup’s credibility will deteriorate quickly. The more information you provide about the product or service, the more likely people are to trust you with their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help develop and maintain your credibility, you must deliver the best of the best to customers in everything from products to customer service. Being honest about your business is what will decide its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I have been able to shed some light on the different ways to build credibility as a new SaaS startup with the help of this article. There is no doubt that following the methods mentioned above will help your new SaaS startup gain credibility. Commit to maintaining your credibility as much as building it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is The Difference Between Deep Learning and Machine Learning?</title>
      <author>images.cv</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 09:12:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/imagescv/what-is-the-difference-between-deep-learning-and-machine-learning-4mi6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/imagescv/what-is-the-difference-between-deep-learning-and-machine-learning-4mi6</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deep-learning-vs-machine-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deep Learning vs Machine Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions on the internet is to know the difference between deep learning and machine learning.&lt;br&gt;
Deep Learning is a subsidiary of machine learning that uses a hierarchical level of artificial neural networks to carry out the process of machine learning. Artificial neural networks mimic the functions of the human brain with many nodes connected together like a web. The hierarchical functions of deep learning systems allow the machines to process data with a nonlinear approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-machine-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is machine learning?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a domain of artificial intelligence that equips the system with the ability to automatically learn from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning emphasizes on the development of programs that can access data and use it to learn and improve the systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automated process begins with observation. This might include examples, experience, or instructions. The algorithm can also look for patterns in the data and detect its future occurrences. The fundamental operating principle is to allow the automatic learning of computers without any human intervention whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Type of Machine Learning methods:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Supervised Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These algorithms can apply learned patterns in the past to new data using the labeled samples to predict forthcoming events. The predicted output is compared with the correct one to correct the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Such algorithms are used when the information used to train the predictive model is neither labeled nor classified. Unsupervised algorithms have the ability to uncover a framework from unlabeled data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforcement Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These algorithms determine the error and rewards by interacting with the environment. Software Engineers can determine the ideal behavior within a context to optimize performance.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Machine Learning Algorithms:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html"&gt;Support Vector Machine (SVM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is a linear model which classifies (categorizes) using a straight line. It creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes. A simple example would be to arrange apples and oranges into classes using SVM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html"&gt;K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is one of the simplest classification algorithms. It uses a database that comprises several data points separated into classes. KNN uses these points to predict a new sample point. The number of samples used to predict is represented by K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html"&gt;K Means Clustering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is an unsupervised learning algorithm. Clustering is a technique for finding similarities in data. We do not have predefined labels or class values. You’ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster while keeping the centroids as small as possible.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction-to-deep-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction to Deep Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning is a subdivision of machine learning that deals with algorithms aimed at mimicking the function of the human brain. Deep Learning creates artificial neural networks to achieve this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the massive success of deep learning is its development side-by-side with the data expansion. &lt;br&gt;
The massive amount of data known as big data, comes from various sources like social media, ecommerce, etc. &lt;br&gt;
This data is widely available and anyone can use it to improve the performance of their models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast amount of data is greatly unstructured and virtually impossible for humans to comprehend. Organizations realize the great potential that might come from extracting this data. This is why companies are using AI for support.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Let us now discuss basic deep learning techniques and algorithms…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning/deep-learning/tensorflow/deep-neural-nets/"&gt;Deep Neural Networks (DNN)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At the basic level, a neural network with some level of complexity at least two layers qualifies as a deep neural network. It is known as a deep net in short. Deep nets process data in a sophisticated mechanism by using complex mathematical functions. All modern-day complex algorithms are known as deep neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn"&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a neural network, we assume that all inputs and outputs are independent of each other. However, in many cases, neural networks are not suitable such as predicting the next word in a sequence. In such a case we need the context of the previous word in the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks use information coming in a sequence. &lt;br&gt;
We call them recurrent because the same operation for every element in the sequence is performed with the output dependent upon the previous computations. They have a memory that stores whatever has been calculated so far. They differ from neural networks in the sense that they do not use feed-forward rather internal state memory to process inputs. &lt;br&gt;
RNNs have a limitation about short-term memory that is overcome using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) that can remember information for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn"&gt;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In deep learning, convolutional neural networks are used to analyze and process visual imagery. They are known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks based upon the shared weight architecture. They are used in image and video recommendation systems, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, natural language processing, etc.&lt;br&gt;
CNN use regularized versions of a multi-layer perceptron. CNN automatically and adaptively learns the hierarchy of features through backpropagation and passes through the layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Birds Eye View of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CNN's are a model for deep learning that is useful for processing data with a grid pattern. They are particularly useful for images due to their inherent grid pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN's consist of three layers known as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. &lt;br&gt;
Convolution and pooling layers perform the extraction of useful features whereas the final layer connects the extracted features with the output that could be classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convolution layer consists of mathematical operations such as a linear operator known as convolution or reduction in the dimensionality of the image. Since images are stored as an array of pixels, and a small grid of parameters known as the kernel, a feature extractor can be applied at each position in the image-making CNN's highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of one layer serves as the input to the next layer so that the extracted features are processed in a hierarchy becoming more complex with progression. Training minimizes the difference between the true labels and the model output by using mathematical algorithms called backpropagation, gradient descent, etc.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that performs better when the data sets are large and/or complex. &lt;br&gt;
If your business relies on a lot of complicated datasets, deep-learning algorithms may be worth exploring to see if they can help improve your bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post has been an introduction to what deep learning is and how it differs from other types of machine learning methods out there. We hope this helps you get started with understanding the basics of these technologies so you can make more informed decisions about which tools will work best for your company's or your personal needs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I have shared the best Coursera courses to learn about &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/08/top-10-coursera-certifications-to-learn-cloud-computing-aws.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Computing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/6-best-software-development-and-project-management-books-for-tech-leads-and-project-managers-5a82a6fbed6b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/08/top-10-coursera-certifications-to-learn-Data-Science-Visualization-and-Data-Analysis.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as many Coursera projects for hands-on learning and today, I am going to share the best Coursera courses and projects one can join to learn &lt;strong&gt;Full-stack Development&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;essential web development skills&lt;/em&gt;] to become a professional web developer in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about these Coursera courses and projects is that you can join them with &lt;em&gt;Coursera Plus&lt;/em&gt;, which means you don't need to buy them individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coursera plus subscription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you can enter all of these courses without extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Development is a very in-demand skill as every organization, business and now even celebrities need web pages. The demand for both frontend and backend developers has been increasing steadily since last 2 decades but the COVID just accelerated the Digital push and so is the demand for IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am not really sure how good 2022 would be compared to 2021 I am certain with one thing that demand for web developers will only go to increase this year. This means more jobs, better jobs, and better salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a great time for web developers to learn new skills like React.js or Angular and full-stack development and switch companies. This not only helps you to earn better but the rush of adrenaline when you join a new company will also help you to learn new skills and make you a better developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to learning, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2F"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite places to go because of its well-structured and in-depth courses from top companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM as well as from the world's top universities like the University of Michigan, Illinois, Duke University, Stanford, etc. They collaborate with more than 200 leading institutions and companies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, If you are planning to join multiple Coursera courses or specializations then consider taking &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;Coursera Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; subscription which provides you unlimited access to their most popular courses, specialization, professional certificate, and guided projects. It cost around $59 per month or $399/year but it's completely worth your money as you get unlimited certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P13cSFNs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9dfq8xeqiv5vng8jer20.gif" alt="Coursera Plus Discount coupon" width="880" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  10 Best Coursera Web Development Specialization and Projects for Beginners to Learn in 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;without any further ado, here is the list of best online courses, specialization, and hands-on projects from Coursera a beginner can join to learn Web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-fullstack-web-development-with-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Ffull-stack-react"&gt;Full-Stack Web Development with React&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React.js is one of the most important skills for a web developer to learn in 2022. The demand for React developers has gone up in the last few years as more and more companies, both big and small have adopted React for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been suggesting developers to &lt;a href="https://javinpaul.medium.com/top-5-courses-to-learn-react-js-in-2019-best-of-lot-fa02cd96cdf0"&gt;learn React.js&lt;/a&gt; for the last 2 years and 2022 is no different in this regard, learning React in 2022 can be the best thing for you, and when it comes to learning React this Coursera specialization is a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most popular Coursera programs to learn Full-stack web development. This one is offered by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This specialization contains 3 courses to teach you frontend development with React.js and Bootstrap and backend development using &lt;a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/top-5-nodejs-and-express-js-online-courses-for-web-developers.html"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java67.com/2020/06/top-5-courses-to-learn-mern-stack-for-web-development.html"&gt;Express.js&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/5-best-mongodb-courses-to-learn-nosql-for-beginners-in-2020-42df5af5496c"&gt;Mongo DB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about social proof, more than 27K students have joined this course and it has an amazing 4.7 rating out of 5, which is quite amazing. If you want to become a full-stack web developer with REact.js then I highly recommend you t join this Coursera specialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the link to join this React.js course&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Ffull-stack-react"&gt;Full-Stack Web Development with React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Ffull-stack-react"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--847k9L6q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pE8pPZy1FD0/YclCJ8otuKI/AAAAAAAAqoc/lEd6C3GInGkzO5yWptYcCLIYxrH3Sz1gQCNcBGAsYHQ/w374-h196/XDP%25257ESPECIALIZATION%252521%25257Efull-stack-react.jpeg" alt="Best React.js course on Coursera" width="374" height="196"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-full-stack-web-development-with-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Ffull-stack-mobile-app-development"&gt;Full Stack Web Development with Angular&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from React.js if there is another framework that is worth learning for web developers then it is Angular which is backed by Google. While React.js is certainly more popular than Angular, there are still many companies using Angular for their projects and there are a lot of Angular jobs available in the market. I did a quick search in indeed and it revealed more than 13K Angular jobs in the USA itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means Angular is definitely worth learning for web developers and this is one of the best Coursera specializations to learn Angular from a Fullstack developer's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is similar to the first course in this list, but this one uses Angular, another popular web development framework for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the first course, which is about React and is supported by Facebook, this one is based on Angular and is endorsed by Google. This one is also offered by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about social proof, more than 4.8K students have joined this course which is quite less compared to the React course and one more reason to choose React.js over Angular, if you want to learn only one frontend framework. It also has an amazing 4.7 rating out of 5, which is quite great and speaks a lot about the quality of the course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the link to join this course&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Ffull-stack-mobile-app-development"&gt;Full Stack Web Development with Angular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Ffull-stack-mobile-app-development"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C0ByotBn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VWo0qDc4quU/YclCWjALVmI/AAAAAAAAqok/GZHk4oGfmAEG2cCh1_erm_gy7Wl3xhTLACNcBGAsYHQ/w385-h202/1-J636VWZ8SXCCgbHV0ELxPg.jpeg" alt="Best Coursera course for Full stack web development with Angular" width="385" height="202"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most popular web design course on Coursera. This course is offered by the University of Michigan and this will teach you web design, basics of web development, and coding in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first two courses are for people already familiar with web development this course is for the complete beginner who wants to start with web development and coding in 2022.  This specialization contains 5 courses to teach you essential web development skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Responsive web design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also comes with a final project which you will build as part of this specialization. Talking about the social proof, more than 230K people have joined this course to learn web design and development and I highly recommend this course to beginners who wants to start their web development career in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have told you before Responsive design is one of the essential skills for professional web development, and this Coursera course will just teach you that. This course is offered by the Goldsmiths, University of London, and taught by expert trainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another beginner-level course on Coursera to learn Web development offered by the University of California, Davis. This is a beginner-level course and it will take approximately 22 hours to complete this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the first two specializations on this list, this is don't a specialization or collection of course but a single course where you will earn web development from scratch. You will learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a real-world website in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about social proof, more than 181K students have joined this course and it has an amazing 4.7 rating out of 5 from close to 3.1K participants, which is quite phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UI Design and UX design is one of those skills that can make or break your web application. If you have used, well-designed apps and products like iPhone then you know that how well thought and intuitive design can make your products better, the same goes with web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your web application is not well designed and has poor UI and UX elements then the user will not like it and it's more likely to fail to achieve its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why it's important for web designers and web developers to have a basic idea of UI and UX design and this Coursera Project can help you to learn basics of user interface design from a web developer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are just starting with building UI like creating HTML pages then you can join this guided project to learn some UI essentials and get skills to improve user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  10. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprojects%2Fintro-css-web-development"&gt;Introduction to CSS in Web Development&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have told you before, CSS is another important skill for both web developers and designers but mastering CSS is very tough. There are so many attributes and concepts like classes, flexbox, grids, a layout which can confuse even experienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Courser project will help you to start with CSS in a hands-on and guided way as you will learn  CSS by following live instructions. This is like someone sitting next to you and guiding you on how to do it and also overseeing that you are doing it in the right way or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are just starting with CSS then I highly recommend you to join this 2-hour long CSS course on Coursera Project Network. More than 3K students have already joined this course and it has on average 4.6 ratings which are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, If you are planning to join multiple Coursera courses or specializations then consider taking &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fcourseraplus"&gt;Coursera Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which provides you unlimited access to their most popular courses, including all of them listed here,  specialization, professional certificate, and guided projects. It cost around $399/year but it's completely worth your money as you get unlimited certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;amp;mid=40328&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fprojects%2Fintro-css-web-development"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O5Nxbnl4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-K9xn2tDXZNw/YclDHzQqLtI/AAAAAAAAqpY/6hY92AL2tPo47bod_f_q1zmQREqSx90_wCNcBGAsYHQ/w395-h207/XDP%25257ECOURSE%252521%25257Eintro-css-web-development.jpeg" alt="Best CSS course from Coursera" width="395" height="207"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all about the &lt;strong&gt;best web development courses and projects on Coursera&lt;/strong&gt;. The best thing about these courses and web development projects is that you don't need to join them individually, instead, you can just join Coursera Plus and get access to all of these best web development programs. I have specially chosen the courses and projects which are part of Coursera Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Websites To Get Free Icons For Web Development</title>
      <author>Sk Shoyeb</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 08:33:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shoyeb001/5-websites-to-get-free-icons-for-web-development-nk6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shoyeb001/5-websites-to-get-free-icons-for-web-development-nk6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article I will discuss about &lt;strong&gt;5 websites to get free icons for web design&lt;/strong&gt;. Specially Frontend developers need custom and  modern icons when they develop a website. So this article will help you in finding icons quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fontawesome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://fontawesome.com/"&gt;Fontawesome&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fontawesome&lt;/strong&gt; is the world's most popular icon CDN. Most of developers use &lt;strong&gt;fontawesome&lt;/strong&gt; icons. Here you can get free web icons, social media brand icons, icons for logos, vector icons, material icons etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flaticon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.flaticon.com/"&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flaticon&lt;/strong&gt; is my personal favourite resource for downloading modern and custom icons, stickers. Here you can get stickers and icons of all things like vegetables, material icons, web icons, social media icons. These icons make your website more attractive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dryicons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://dryicons.com/"&gt;Dryicons&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dryicons&lt;/strong&gt; contains more than 6000 **vector graphics **and icons. These icons are also very colorful. You can use these in UI and UX design and web design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#icons8"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://icons8.com/"&gt;Icons8&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the famous resource for icons and design elements download. Here you can get free design elements, photos, graphics, svg, music for your video. I have used this 2 or 3 times before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iconfinder"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/"&gt;Iconfinder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iconfinder&lt;/strong&gt; is the world largest icon and &lt;strong&gt;graphic element marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;. Many developers don't know about this website. There are free and premium products. You can access over 200,000 icons, illustrations, 3d graphics for free. You can use these elements in your website or UI UX designs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this article is helpful to you. If yes, I just need a heart on this post. If I am missing any resource for icons tell me in comment box. Thanking you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons Learned from Building Businesses as a Technical Solo Founder</title>
      <author>Mo Boudra</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 07:58:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/moboudra/lessons-learned-from-building-businesses-as-a-technical-solo-founder-5dpb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/moboudra/lessons-learned-from-building-businesses-as-a-technical-solo-founder-5dpb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been working on my SaaS projects all by myself over the last four years, and I've had some failures and some success, here are some of the lessons that I've learned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may look easy from the outside, doing all the development, marketing, customer service and everything else required to run a business takes a lot of time and effort, but it's not impossible. There are countless examples of highly successful businesses operated by a one-person team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples that I know of are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a ref="nofollow" href="https://unicornplatform.com/"&gt;Unicorn Platform ($19k MRR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a ref="nofollow" href="https://bannerbear.com/"&gt;Bannerbear ($27k MRR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a ref="nofollow" href="https://nomadlist.com/"&gt;NomadList ($46K MRR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, they're all run by a single person doing all the things, including the development of the product. They're all very open about how they go about things and their blogs are a great source of inspiration!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tame-your-inner-perfectionist"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tame your inner perfectionist
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to let go of your ego and allow yourself to ship something that might embarrass you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, I am not talking about shipping a half-assed product or something that doesn't work . The hustle MVP mentality of building something functional in a weekend, and releasing it to see if anyone is desperate enough to buy your product is not sustainable either, there's a middle ground where you can be proud of your product but release with some rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason we think that when we release a project to the wild people will start flocking to the signup page, "you build it, they will come" right? but it's never the case, which yeah it is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've spent all this time building this great but no one knows about it yet, marketing is as important if not more important than the development of the product, so make sure you allocate some time for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, unless you already have an audience, it's going to be a long time form when you deploy your project to get paid customers that are not your family or buddies, so the earlier you launch that the earlier you can start getting real feedback and iterate on your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I get the urge to spend a whole day refactoring simple things I ask myself if this will bring more value to the customer, if in the same amount of time that it will take me to refactor this little thing I can provide more value elsewhere I try to do that instead. I know, easier said than done :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#focus-on-what-energizes-you"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Focus on what energizes you
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business needs constant attention and you have to be able to put in the hours, even when you don't want to, the worst thing is having to work in areas that you don't enjoy. Make sure you work on something that uses your strengths as much as possible, this will also give you a competitive advantage against the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why I decided to work on something like &lt;a href="https://geniebot.co"&gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt;, it's a problem that I am passionate about and I can see it evolve in many directions, which excites me and I know will keep me on my toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-it-for-the-right-reasons"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do it for the right reasons
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have realized that all my failed projects had something in common, they were all built for the wrong reasons. I was chasing a trend, trying to take advantage of a growth opportunity, or unconsciously copying someone else's idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When that happens it eventually gets to a point where you don't have the energy to work on it anymore and lose motivation, whenever you start a new project you should ask whether you can see yourself working on this in the next years and if you don't then the idea might not be worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to figure out the right reasons yourself as everyone has different priorities, my reason at the moment is that I'd like to make a living doing what I enjoy doing, so I start from there, and then pick something that can solve a real problem and turn it into a business, and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been proven that most of what makes a business successful is being consistent and relentlessly market and improving your product to solve real problems, so ensuring that you work on something that you'll be able to still enjoy during years is a pretty great indicator of future success.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this insightful! Share if you did :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am currently working on &lt;a href="https://geniebot.co"&gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that streamlines the process of building and deploying custom bots.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>＄Tracing Money in Development</title>
      <author>Yusuf Turhan Papurcu</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 07:26:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/yusufpapurcu/tracing-money-in-development-54dg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/yusufpapurcu/tracing-money-in-development-54dg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After nearly 1 month, I am here with %40 but noticeable progress. I was so busy so I had a little chances in weeks to develop this fun product. In 1 month I worked less than 10 hours for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have a really basic telegram bot 🎉🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am saying basic because this telegram bot has 2 commands at all. One command for expense logging and one command for income logging. It works and stores data to supabase. I think thats enough for first step. So before talking about our next steps lets talk about progress some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="//github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api"&gt;&lt;code&gt;go-telegram-bot-api&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a telegram bot client library. This library is useful enough to create this bot. Also I used &lt;a href="//github.com/supabase/postgrest-go"&gt;&lt;code&gt;postgrest-go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for implementing supabase. Also with &lt;code&gt;postgrest-go&lt;/code&gt; I can use local postgreSQL for testing. Thats a nice feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For testing I created very basic &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt;. Even I didn't write that. I copied from postgrest document :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thats the progress. Oh also I created a logo for this project. You can see it on &lt;a href="https://github.com/tracingmoney"&gt;github organization&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; in excalidraw and screenshooted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For next I will do some data science and I will create usage analysis for my expenses. I hope this project can reach its destination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to a stateful &amp; maintainable React Local Storage hook</title>
      <author>prakash chokalingam</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 07:09:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/prakash_chokalingam/introduction-to-a-stateful-maintainable-react-local-storage-hook-31ie</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/prakash_chokalingam/introduction-to-a-stateful-maintainable-react-local-storage-hook-31ie</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to storing a value on the client-side persistently, most of us will prefer browser storage (local or session storage) because of its simplified APIs to store and retrieve data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet maintaining these storages in large-scale applications are not so easy, especially with micro frontends architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hook &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webcored/react-local-storage"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides an awesome set of features to maintain the browser storage effortlessly for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#namespacing"&gt;Namespacing &amp;amp; Configurations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#stateful"&gt;Defaults &amp;amp; States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#migration"&gt;Versions &amp;amp; Migrations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#namespacing-amp-configurations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Namespacing &amp;amp; Configurations &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless it's documented, we don't know the storage keys being used in an application &amp;amp; we are not sure about the values of the keys as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key name conflicts are more common in micro-frontends. An app should control its own set of keys and it should not override the common or other app's key. Hence, namespacing plays a major factor to avoid these conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;delimiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the key is &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;, the storage key value is &lt;code&gt;dev#user&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-available-storage-configurations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  other available storage configurations,
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;storage: choose between local or session storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;storages: key configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;react: instance for state management (useState hook)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./storages/user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;delimiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sessionStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;storages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// user key configs&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#defaults-amp-states"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Defaults &amp;amp; States &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default state for keys in browser storage is the most required feature. It indulges a lot of programming effort to maintain the default state for every key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In @webcored/react-local-storage each key can have its config, and the default states for keys can be incorporated easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;/storages/user.js&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageKeyConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageKeyConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Guest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;guest@email.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The storages are simply accessible via the &lt;code&gt;useLocalStorage&lt;/code&gt; hook in a stateful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;/component.js&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLocalStorage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLocalStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And the dispatcher comes with painless APIs to invoke the storage programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  update
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;avatar.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reset"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  reset
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reset the storage to the default state.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remove"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  remove
&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#versions-amp-migrations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Versions &amp;amp; Migrations &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_NHloWYF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/reg6y36rod3svtanpir2.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_NHloWYF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/reg6y36rod3svtanpir2.gif" alt="versions" width="498" height="498"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the storages are persistent, changing its data structure quite often may be challenging, and it involves a lot of code changes per key. With @webcored/react-local-storage these data migrations can be simply handled with a version number &amp;amp; a migration callback in the key config.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageKeyConfig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storageKeyConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;defaults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Guest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;guest@email.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;guest.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// new&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;migration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;@webcored/react-local-storage supports versioning of keys by default. &lt;br&gt;
As per the above code block, the current version of user storage is incremented. While rendering, if the browser had an outdated version of storage, the migration method will be invoked. The migrated value will be considered as the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-highlights"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  other highlights
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports all data types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;typescript supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#checkout-the-sample-apps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  checkout the sample apps
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

...&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
typescript

&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-ts position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;useLocalStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'user'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
...&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h5&gt;
update&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js position-relative overflow-auto js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;userStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;span class="pl-s1"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;'new name'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-kos"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>RPA: Catalyst of Industrial Revolution 4.0</title>
      <author>K S Monish Kumar</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 06:56:59 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/monish3004/rpa-catalyst-of-industrial-revolution-40-53nj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/monish3004/rpa-catalyst-of-industrial-revolution-40-53nj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robotic Process Automation popularly known as RPA. It is used to automate a repetitive task such as sending 500 emails per day, extracting some data from any number of invoices which are partially structured and a storing it in a excel file which is structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was invented to convert unstructured data generated in the third industrial revolution into structured data by analyzing it. It is capable of mimicking human actions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) to handle RPA. The environment can be categorized into &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Code Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Code Platform is preferred by everyone as it is efficient in many ways. The major Platforms are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UiPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue Prism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation Anywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a automations that I have made which makes my life easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic everyone has to join meetings or classes virtually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#joining-classes-or-meeting-on-the-scheduled-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Joining classes or meeting on the scheduled time
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the link for the video for the automation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qs4yHUd32eKIKEmarNo7bDpO4BNL_5kw/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Video Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscribe for more automations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Awesome VSCode extensions for a better coding experience [ Part 1 ]</title>
      <author>Hyperloop007</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 06:52:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hyperloop/awesome-vscode-extensions-for-a-better-coding-experience-part-1--3i9b</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hyperloop/awesome-vscode-extensions-for-a-better-coding-experience-part-1--3i9b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself typing all the HTML boilerplate code when you decided to make a new project or imagine not being able to recall the name of that single property in css and searching the web for it. Why am I talking about all this? It's obvious because this kind of stuff would really suck. So, that brings us to the wonderful extensions that we have in vscode made by a lot of people and you can use them for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are vscode extensions anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSCode extensions let you add debuggers and various tools to your environment and works through various custom settings that the extensions bring with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSCode extensions are a great way to reduce your workload and make it easy for you to write your code and format it. You can even create your own vscode extensions but we won't talk about it here. There are a lots of extensions available on vscode as of today but I will mention some of which I find really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Auto Close Tag:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably figure out from the name here this extension automatically closes the HTML/XML opening tags you write. You can customize or change the settings from the vscode auto close tag settings.&lt;br&gt;
It can even be used to close the self closing tags in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---TaGmQfL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xwgs7zwzi13bqlguqjif.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---TaGmQfL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xwgs7zwzi13bqlguqjif.gif" alt="Image description" width="880" height="573"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Auto Rename Tag:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This very extension lets you rename both the opening and the closing tag at once saving you the pain of renaming the tags one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HjFaKrW0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ix2qhh1ykrcudrisciol.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HjFaKrW0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ix2qhh1ykrcudrisciol.gif" alt="Image description" width="880" height="573"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Bracket Pair Colorizer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension colors bracket pairs based on their positioning in the code i.e. bracket pairs adjacent to each other will have different set of color from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the code look really clean and makes it easy to figure out the block of code you want to go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zWo1vZOX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hlowfxqsmbh9j83c8ewq.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zWo1vZOX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hlowfxqsmbh9j83c8ewq.jpg" alt="Image description" width="859" height="421"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Indent Rainbows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is not all that different from the Bracket Pair Colorizer, just that it does the same with levels of indentations which can prove to be helpful in a language like python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VwlXPE51--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n0eh2rsmjybtnmuc3mu4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VwlXPE51--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n0eh2rsmjybtnmuc3mu4.png" alt="Image description" width="443" height="156"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Live Server:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much needs to be said about one of the most popular and useful extensions of all in vscode where you can see live previews and changes of your work with just a single click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8qdqkQeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9fdsh89duovgb9luf8v1.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8qdqkQeM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9fdsh89duovgb9luf8v1.gif" alt="Image description" width="880" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many more to come in part 2...&lt;/p&gt;
