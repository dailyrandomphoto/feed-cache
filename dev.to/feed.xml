      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Kotlin vs Java comparison is a very popular these days…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are considering getting into Android app development in 2021, you probably must have found yourself in this dilemma too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which language between Kotlin and Java is the best for Android development? I did a quick search online on Kotlin vs Java for Android development but I was not satisfied with the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Java vs Kotlin comparisons tend to compare both languages from the technical perspective of the language structure and design.&lt;br&gt;
In most instances, I also realized that the comparisons were geared towards a company that wants to transition their Java development team into Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I personally enjoyed reading these articles, because I’m a programmer, I kept wondering how a Kotlin vs Java comparison would be from a non technical point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to write this Java vs Kotlin comparison to target both experienced programmers as well as complete beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I am going to compare Kotlin and Java for Android while trying as much as possible to avoid showing you code or the very technical details of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also finish this article by outlining 3 reasons why I think you should learn Kotlin if your are complete beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how Kotlin also compares with the new Swift language, check out my other Kotlin vs Swift performance comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin&lt;br&gt;
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains than runs on the Java Virtual Machine(JVM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Google announced its official support for Kotlin as a native Android app development language, it has become popular pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of companies have moved in to embrace it for their Android development since its launch in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it do a better job that good old Java?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java&lt;br&gt;
Java is a multi-purpose object oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems but now owned by Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been ranked as the most popular language on Stackoverflow for years because of the number of Java developers who use it in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, most importantly, it has been the go to language for native Android app development as Android itself is written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it sound more robust than the little kid, Kotlin, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see about that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what each of these programming languages is, let’s dive right into the details of this Kotlin vs Java comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll compare Kotlin with Java in terms of syntax differences, developer productivity, community support etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin vs Java: Language Structure&lt;br&gt;
There are a lot of differences in the language structures of both Kotlin and Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we are going to compare these differences in terms of general language syntax and new features like null safety and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language Syntax&lt;br&gt;
Kotlin language syntax is precise and concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that you’ll need to write less Kotlin code to implement a similar functionality in a language like Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is one of the main advantages of Kotlin because you end up with less code which means fewers mistakes in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, ‘getters’ and ‘setters’ functions come in-build in Kotlin, so you don’t need to code your own.&lt;br&gt;
Java code, on the other hand, is a tad more verbose than Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’ll generally need to write more code to implement a similar feature in Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more code you write, the more you potentially introduce more errors or bugs in your final Android application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, often used functions like ‘getters’ and ‘setters’ don’t come in-build in Java, so you’ll have to code your own… this increases the amount of code you need to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Null Safety&lt;br&gt;
One of the most infuriating issues in Android app development is how to handle null pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android completely relies on NULL to denote the absence of a value, and this can completely destroy an application or make it crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin resolves this NullPointerException issue by incorporating inherent null safety feature by default in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kotlin compiler will not let you access a nullable variable without a proper check first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performing a null check on your variables every time helps avoid the NullPointerException which then prevents your app from crashing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java, on the other hand, allows you to assign null to any variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you try to access an object that has a null value, you’ll encounter the NullPointerException and your app crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, unlike Kotlin,all data types are nullable in Java, you’ll need to write extra code to handle these situations every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if null value handling has been your main problem with Java, Kotlin is what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a workaround, though, for making Kotlin types nullable if your need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability&lt;br&gt;
Can you mix Kotlin code with Java or vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what’s the advantage of being able to write both Java and Kotlin at the same time in the same app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People debate so much about whether to use Java or Kotlin in their Android apps, but they forget a third option…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the differences in the language structure and syntax between Kotlin and Java, both languages are 100% interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, while you can call Kotlin code from Java, you can also call Java code from Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Java and Kotlin classes can exist side by side and everything compiles just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already know both languages, you might find that certain features are easier for you to implement in Java while others in Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know what? Your Android app users won’t even notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Kotlin vs Java interoperability feature is a big plus in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin vs Java: Developer Productivity&lt;br&gt;
How does Kotlin compare with Java in terms of developer productivity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one enables you to develop your Android app faster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s compare Kotlin vs Java developer productivity by looking at the code compilation time as well as the general coding speed of a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compilation Time&lt;br&gt;
As compared to cross-platform mobile app development, developing an Android app using a native language takes longer compilation times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer compilations times impact developer productivity in that you take longer to view app code changes, which slows you down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does Java vs Kotlin compare in terms of code compilation time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin code, from my experience, takes longer to compile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is even gets worse with incremental code compilations, which means more time is spent just waiting for the code to compile before you can reload your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java, however, offers you very faster source code compilation times compared to Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Java code compiles faster than Kotlin, you’ll experience some gains in time saved when writing your Android code in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this alone amount to higher productivity in Java, though?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development Speed&lt;br&gt;
Your ability to write your code fast in a very key factor in determining your productivity in a software development tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by this I DON’T mean your keyboard typing speed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin, having a brief and concise syntax, means that you need to write less code in order to implement a similar functionality as compared to Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think about it in terms of…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to build more features in your app in an hour than you’d do in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because you’ll need more time to write code that implements the same feature in Java… this means your development speed is slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a developer needs less time to finish up their app in Kotlin than in Java, it reduces the project’s time-to-market, which means more productivity in Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codebase Maintenance&lt;br&gt;
How about maintaining the application code once it’s written in Java vs Kotlin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, since Kotlin apps have fewer lines of code as compared to Java, it means the maintenance needs of a Kotlin app will be less as compared to Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I say this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s because the concise nature of Kotlin enables you to read and modify code more efficiently because there is less surface area for bugs to hide Kotlin vs Java: Community Support&lt;br&gt;
When comparing Java vs Kotlin community support, we’ll look at which one has a bigger and more active community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an active community is key for any software development tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, both languages are developed and supported by great tech companies: Oracle for Java and JetBrains for Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An active community means you can easily get help when you are stuck or have some code optimization questions or fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Java beats the pants of Kotlin, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, really!&lt;br&gt;
Kotlin vs Java: Popularity&lt;br&gt;
Finally, let’s finish this Kotlin vs Java comparison by looking at their popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While comparing popularity, we’ll consider the language that’s already used in production by more companies and startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is used for Android development by many companies including: Pinterest, Uber, Trello, KickStarter, Coursera, Corda, Capital One, Evernote, BaseCamp 3, Netflix, Amazon, Twidere for Twitter, Shadowsocks &amp;amp; KotlinConf app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java is also being used in production by companies including: k-9 Mail, AmazeFileManager, Omni-Notes, Phonograph application, Pixel-dungeon, Telegram for Android, Qksms, VLC media player, MovieGuide, Bitcoin Wallet Android &amp;amp; SeeWeather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, clearly, both Kotlin and Java are ready for your Android project idea because many other companies already use them in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of market share, both languages are widely used, even though Java definitely has way more Android apps because it’s almost 20 years older than this kid, Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There goes the Kotlin vs Java comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you now ready to choose which language, between Java and Kotlin, is best for your Android app project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish this Java vs Kotlin comparison, here are 3 reasons why you should learn Kotlin instead of Java for Android app development in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 reasons you should learn Kotlin instead of Java in 2021&lt;br&gt;
Kotlin offers you interoperability with Java, so if you are already a Java developer, your transition can be incremental… at your pace.&lt;br&gt;
The Kotlin team is working on Kotlin multi-platform, a tool that will enable your to build your Android app but ship it to iOS ass well with the same code.&lt;br&gt;
Even though the Java community is much bigger, the Kotlin team is full of more excited and enthusiastic devs… which kind of sounds cool!&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion&lt;br&gt;
Both Kotlin and Java are great programming languages, first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, they are amazing tools for developing your Android application in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some people try to force down out throats some kind of “war” between the two Android development languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is NO war here boy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotlin does not replace Java, neither does Java replace Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java is Java while Kotlin is Kotlin. They are alternative ways of doing the same thing. So choose your preferred option and knock yourself out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when pundits tried to force an Android vs iOS war…?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it wasn’t no war at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are just two mobile platforms that solve the same problem differently. Android has its lovers while iOS has its lovers too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I hope this Kotlin vs Java comparison has helped you understand the differences between these two languages.&lt;br&gt;
By understanding their differences you can choose which does it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have time and resources to burn, I’d suggest you learn and build an app on both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, you’ll be your own judge as two which one between the two does a better job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you used Kotlin or Java for Android development before?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>React souce code visible 😲</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/dhanushxeno/react-souce-code-visible-4e57</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know that when you deploy your React application which is created using 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 or your own webpack configuration to a live website like Netlify, Vercel, Heroku etc, your entire source code is visible to everyone from the sources tab of the developer toolbar as shown in the screenshot of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an issue with the 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁-𝗮𝗽𝗽 but all of the source code is added because of the source map&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😲😲😲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you definitely don't want everyone to see your entire source code If it's a private repository or you're working on a client project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an easy way to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file with the name .env in your project folder with the below code inside it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so when you run 𝗻𝗽𝗺 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 or 𝘆𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 command from the terminal,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will generate a 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 folder with minified files without a source map that you can deploy to the production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decoding The Brain</title>
      <author>AaronDski</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 05:24:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aarondski/will-i-ever-learn-code-5619</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aarondski/will-i-ever-learn-code-5619</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer I am not a Medical Professional. This information is my own deduction on how the brain functions, when we learn something new. Links to my sources are below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a new language can be more difficult than some people might realize. Or is it? There are a number of reasons, excuses and justifications that we all can use to avoid learning a new language... to say that, "it's just too hard." I, for one, am guilty of this unhealthy mindset. &lt;em&gt;Is this the way things are always going to be?&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, &lt;em&gt;Is there no way of escaping the fact that there are just some things I won't be great at (or even mediocre, by some standards)?&lt;/em&gt; I needed to know, and so I did some research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, when you try to learn something new--like skills, sports, languages, coding, etc--there are many things happening simultaneously in your brain. I'm going to point out a few that stuck out to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) ##Dopamine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is released in the brain when we do something that we enjoy; it's the chemical that makes us feel good. Simple enough. But what if we need to learn something that we &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; really enjoy, or that we don't even remotely like? Well it certainly makes it harder to listen to someone teaching on the topic. What if you had to learn that thing you had no interest in, but there was a large sum of money waiting for you once you had mastered the topic? Would you be more interested then? I know I would be. &lt;br&gt;
There is a very simple tactic we can use to motivate ourselves: set small objectives that can be achieved daily, which help to move you toward your desired destination. By doing this, we are not only establishing self-discipline, but we are creating miniature, daily "wins" by achieving goals, which makes us feel good (Dopamine), and produces motivation in us... and we may even then start to enjoy the topic or task at hand. (Disclaimer: there will always be subjects/projects that are not enjoyable). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is not only a great way to find things that we enjoy, but it is also a very helpful tool in the learning process. When there is more dopamine involved in your studying, your brain will find ways to reference those memories or thoughts, thus reinforcing what you just learned. So if you are on a topic that you don't particularly like, find a "carrot" to dangle in front of you. You will be amazed at what the brain is capable of, when it has a reason to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) ##Neurons &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurons--you have around 85 billion of them. A neuron cell acts as a messenger, sending information in the form of nerve impulses (like electrical signals) to other neurons. This is how our brains access memories, operate our motor functions, and direct our speech, etc. So what does that mean when we are learning something new? Well, for everything that we already know, there are set pathways for our neurons to follow, but for things we &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; previously learned, a pathway has not yet been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the case when we don't know something: we "draw a blank" or just simply can't find the answer. In the event when we can come up with an educated guess or solution to something haven't learned, it is because our brains are trying to find a pattern or some common ground with something else we already know--a relative pathway for the information to move through. Say when you can't find a pathway, what does you brain do? It makes a new pathway, of course! You can think about making pathways like blazing a trail in a forest. Now we have a new pathway for the info to work with, but it's not that strong of a connection, (not a well-groomed, obvious trail). How do we make this connection stronger? Easy: use that pathway more. This is why repetition works so well to make things stick in your brain. Ever seen a cow trail? Same basic concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) ##BLC (Bilingual Language Control)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a joint study on BLC done by Marco Calabria, Albert Costa, David W. Green, and Jubin Abutalebie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This BLC ability is now established as the architecture of what our brain is assessing when it decides what language to use. This complex system involves cortical and subcortical (different areas of the brain) structures, each responsible for particular cognitive processes, such as goal maintenance, conflict monitoring, interference suppression, and selective response inhibition. Our brain will separate the 2 languages, so that they don't interfere with each other. Switching between languages is very hard at first, but the more you do it the less taxing it becomes. It is incredible to think that, without our instruction or even awareness, our brain is able to switch to a completely different way of thinking, in a matter of nano seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would surmise that this is applicable not only to spoken languages but to coding as well. Why not? They are "languages," after all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) ##Healthy Habits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A.) Work well with others.&lt;br&gt;
Collaboration and collaborative learning have been a part of our human nature for as long as we know. We are inherently social beings and social learners. When collaborative learning techniques are used to support instruction, students tend to be more engaged, retain information better, and have better outcomes than those who prefer to be "solo learners."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B.) Don't be stagnant.&lt;br&gt;
Be constantly learning new things, even if they are small things. When you learn, you are increasing/maintaining good and healthy neuroplasticity. In a way, our brains are like &lt;em&gt;Play-Doh.&lt;/em&gt; If you don't use your &lt;em&gt;Play-Doh,&lt;/em&gt; it gets hard and dried out. Our brains don't literally dry out, but you get the point. Use it frequently, or your brain will begin to lose functionality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.) Rest.&lt;br&gt;
Good sleep is one of the (if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) greatest ways for your brain to replenish, re-energize, and heal. A tired brain can't accomplish much.&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, taking breaks is more beneficial than you might realize. Spacing out your study time with small breaks (15-20 minute beaks every 2-or-so hours of studying) is very helpful in not getting "burnt out," because your brain is able to "take a breather between legs of the race" (as it were).&lt;br&gt;
My hypothesis is that it gives the brain time to strengthen and consolidate the connections between your neurons, and sort through necessary information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This greater understanding of how your brain functions and the use of supportive learning strategies can now allow you to help your brain to better learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note: Stay hydrated! Maintain a consistent intake of water... trust me! Your brain will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to fix domain change error</title>
      <author>Jeff Chavez</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 04:47:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jctechdev/how-to-fix-domain-change-issue-2gg1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jctechdev/how-to-fix-domain-change-issue-2gg1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried updating you website domain name then got an issue where the domain name is changed but you cannot log-in on your website? For example, you're changing your website domain name in the WordPress general settings from &lt;a href="http://www.yourdev.com"&gt;www.yourdev.com&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.yourdeveloper.com"&gt;www.yourdeveloper.com&lt;/a&gt;. The site domain has been changed but you cannot access it and all that you are seeing is the sample image below: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EYUuAb4k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wz0f3bssd5lntfrty6lx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EYUuAb4k--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wz0f3bssd5lntfrty6lx.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Today, we'll learn how to &lt;em&gt;retrieve your domain name after changing it in WordPress general settings&lt;/em&gt;. Note that this does not require database or PHP knowledge, and I am indebted to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzhFJAXj2yA&amp;amp;t=176s"&gt;Webdev Maestro&lt;/a&gt; for this resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log-in to your website &lt;strong&gt;CPanel&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--V2V8HVik--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b192evrzncxes3izupps.PNG" alt="Capture"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then go to the &lt;em&gt;file manager&lt;/em&gt; under &lt;strong&gt;files&lt;/strong&gt; section.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pwcusB9o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5tdx774k8qysp15dk0b3.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next is to find the &lt;strong&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/strong&gt; file in the main page of your public manager. If it is not there, you can find it in the &lt;strong&gt;public_html&lt;/strong&gt; folder.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mIsBmsXp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/41nqby64u3n43ob6vlld.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the &lt;strong&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/strong&gt; file, then hit view. Then locate define DB Name and take note of the particular name.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--H8ta2d8a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9lje3ei5vpxqcngs6740.PNG" alt="2"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, go back to your your &lt;strong&gt;CPanel&lt;/strong&gt; and under &lt;em&gt;databases&lt;/em&gt; click phpMyAdmin.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fVk81Nf_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dhb7mq9ibf9nw5ulsj3p.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the side bar, click on the plus "+" sign beside the name of the database that you have taken note earlier on the &lt;strong&gt;wp-config.php&lt;/strong&gt; to collapse the options. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yUjMJP71--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r1y612nt14btvqi66odx.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Then click on the name of your databases suffixed with &lt;strong&gt;"_options"&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vcj6uCdv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dl7b16gkif0u88furdu5.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll see that the &lt;em&gt;siteurl&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; have the domain name that you are changing your domain to which also gives you an error. Now, our goal is to &lt;strong&gt;change siteurl and home variables&lt;/strong&gt;. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rzPUCC6h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/50vogh2fq7pcfmq8dxjx.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;em&gt;pencil&lt;/em&gt; icon on the left to edit each variables. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Sk7AEB6Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pp839sw6fuflupn1o5b8.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then you'll get to the next page so that you can &lt;strong&gt;change the website URL to the old one&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure that you are updating it to the &lt;strong&gt;initial domain name&lt;/strong&gt; that you have before changing it. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kApcN1Xm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kbz76r3g4yx8k3zc5fa8.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure on the options down the page you have the settings below (save and then go back to previous page):
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_whB4pn8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4v76cuaicdvmsybae108.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the same for the &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; variable. If you can't find it on the first page then go to the next. 
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--c7Z7wFXz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hhn7wggzbjv58hizqm9r.png" alt="image"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once done, close the current tab, then go to the initial domain name and there you go, you'll have it back. &lt;strong&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/strong&gt; You are able to retrieve your website and domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have the same issue?&lt;br&gt;
Let me know what other fix resolution you have for this error.&lt;/p&gt;

  Hashtables and information retrieval
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central theme behind hash tables is smart information storage and retrieval. The data must be stored in such a manner that it becomes very easy to search it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to store a data of any thousand numbers ranging from one to a million. Using hashtables, we can efficiently store these numbers in a way which makes it easy for searching. This is possible only if we map the values to 'keys' The idea of hash table is to allow different possibilities of keys that might over to be mapped to the same location in an array. This is done with the help of 'hashfunctions' The hash function takes in a value and maps it to a key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example we might take the hash function as taking only the last three digits of the number. So, 45367 will go to the position 367, while 3769 will go to 769. In case of two numbers have same set of last three digits, we can use different algorithms to resolve collision. One way to do that is using 'chained hashtables' or linked hash tables. In this, lists are present in the hashtables instead of numeric values, where the values can be appended. The example below will make things more clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Simple hashtable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us now see how to make a simple hashtable from using a dictionary. The user enters say five values, and we map them to a table of length ten. If the values of the keys overlap, then error message is generated and new value is ignored. This collisionj management will be handled by the next version of hashtable, i.e. linked hashtables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this program, we use a simple hashfunction given be the modulus operator as - &lt;code&gt;key = value % length&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Please enter an integer "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#very simple hash function for length 10
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#to check if the element is already present in the position or not.
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"error-- value occupied!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
           &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OUTPUT-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Please enter an integer 2
Please enter an integer 43
Please enter an integer 56
Please enter an integer 63
error-- value occupied!
Please enter an integer 78
{8: 78, 2: 2, 3: 43, 6: 56}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise 1)&lt;/strong&gt;-Modify the above code to map Unicode characters to the hashtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#linked-hashtable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Linked hashtable.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now create a linked hashtable, i.e. hashtable of lists. This way, we solve the issue of the keys in the same position. If there are multiple values for the same list, then the values are appended on a list rather than ignoring them. This method is used for fast data retrieval&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Please enter a number "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#append to original list exists.
&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#make a new list
&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Please enter a number 23
Please enter a number 45
Please enter a number 65
Please enter a number 34
Please enter a number 79
Please enter a number 86
Please enter a number 54
Please enter a number 123
Please enter a number 457
Please enter a number 389
{3: [23, 123], 4: [34, 54], 5: [45, 65], 6: [86], 7: [457], 9: [79, 389]}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#retrieving-data-from-the-hashtable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Retrieving data from the hashtable
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can retrieve the data from the hashtable very efficiently. In the same way as we added the data, we now will remove and display it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;b=int(input("Please enter the value"))
key=b%10
print(a[key].pop(b))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Answers as usual in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Aatmaj-Zephyr/Learning-Python"&gt;learning python repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Hashtables are  one of the many many data structures present. For more information related to data structures and algorithms, please visit this series of blogs-&lt;a href="https://dev.to/ayabouchiha/series/13547"&gt;Data structures blog series by &lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I've recently picked up interest in contributing to this platform (forem/dev.to) so I've been reading the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm now stuck on the installation of ImageMagick. I run on Windows OS so im not sure if i'm to install ImageMagick on WSL or on my machine itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please help clarify. Thanks!!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily React - 2: State Sharing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a story to tell but the story is different each time I am in a different universe. So, I want to show audiences those stories whenever they travel through different universes. For example, the story in finite vector space will be a little bit different from inifinite vector space. In another example, Disney world will have different themes and rides from Universal Studios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My story is different a set of math universes that are rather focused on the different math textbooks and different proofs that each textbook brings in each book. So, I need to control the title of the book state and the axioms in each book state. I wanted to sync it and here it is how I did it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello Friends, I have listed over 15 best css accordion designs made with HTML, CSS, and JS. Check out these excellent accordion examples which are available on Codepen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#awesome-accordion-design-2021-step-by-step"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Awesome Accordion Design 2021 step by step
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-1-creating-a-new-project"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 1 — Creating a New Project
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we need to create a new project folder and files(index.html, style.css) for creating a simple accordion design. In the next step, you will start creating the structure of the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#step-2-setting-up-the-basic-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 2 — Setting Up the basic structure
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add the HTML code to create the basic structure of the project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"en"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"X-UA-Compatible"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"IE=edge"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"viewport"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;How to create accordion with css only&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"style.css"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:wght@200;400&amp;amp;display=swap"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"stylesheet"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the base structure of most web pages that use HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following code inside the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"accordion_outer"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"container"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Section 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"details"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Step 3 — Adding Styles for the Classes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this step, we will add styles to the section class Inside style.css file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;'IBM Plex Sans'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#dae9f9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;max-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1140px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;details&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#f2f4f6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;18px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#fff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;10px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>As a developer, do you even bother with containerisation?</title>
      <author>Anthony Lapenna</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/deviantony/as-a-developer-do-you-even-bother-with-containerisation-3bob</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there, trying to understand a bit better on how developers are actually using containers and solely for the purpose of developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying containers to production is another concern and whether it concerns you or not is another discussion :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that docker-compose is a pretty common tool for creating a local development stack but are you using any other tools to use containers locally or do you actually don't bother with containers because what you want is just write code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy to discuss!&lt;/p&gt;
