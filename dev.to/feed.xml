      <title>A little rant and a big opportunity</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/noriller/a-little-rant-and-a-big-opportunity-k8m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard about it... “the great resignation”, “IT professionals shortage”, and the seeming coming apocalypse of what this is bringing... and that brings me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-little-rant"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My little rant
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; to be dying down and after almost two years basically without leaving home... I want nothing more than some change right now. So, I’ve been trying for the last few months to get a job abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... depending on your passport and the country you’re aiming for, it’s not just about finding a job. You need visa sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative, if you don’t have the “right” passport, is to apply for a resident visa (or some other type of visa that would also let you work there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch and source of my rant is: visa sponsorship is cheap!&lt;br&gt;
When you compare with how much a developer makes, it’s only a fraction of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is not everything, and some, me included, would see that as a “perk” when comparing companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big companies already know that and sponsor visas, but somehow... many companies are already digging their graves in anticipation of the day they won’t find more people... but won’t even consider hiring foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-i-ask-why"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And I ask: &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it that feel people are not qualified enough?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because let me tell you... I heard a story from a guy that have 15+ years of experience happy to get a job paying less than 30K USD/year, which is very good where I live, but, as you might be thinking, that can be a fraction of what a junior fresh out of college makes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about English (or the language of the country)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another story I heard is about a Ruby developer at a Conference... he was coding when someone went to talk to him, he didn’t speak English, but with whatever rudimentary English he had and some gestures... he got a job!&lt;br&gt;
(This one is from a podcast I follow, and I don’t remember all the details, but that's the gist.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is... that language (natural language, that is) is not really a barrier. It’s a lot easier to learn English than it is to learn (and be good at) a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or is it the bureaucracy?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that the root of all evil? Or is it something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-big-opportunity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The big opportunity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies still have to learn to live in a global world... they have to be open to getting people from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are companies that connect companies to developers from all around the world, but they are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is still something that the company has to... “subscribe” to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#or"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OR
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone will have to make a “bridge” of sorts, making hiring someone from abroad so stupid easily as hiring someone locally/in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one who makes the “Uber of hiring foreigners”, will certainly make a killing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I say that, I’m talking about something where I, a job seeker, will use and the hiring company will know that if they like me, that “bridge” will take care of the rest.&lt;br&gt;
(Just ask and I will tell you exactly what I’m thinking about it.)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-little-opportunity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; opportunity
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, this is my shameless self-promotion section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m up for grabs and you can interactively interview me (yes, you’ve read that right!) at:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use built-in Proxy object in javascript</title>
      <author>Gajanan Patil</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 16:02:57 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/gajananpp/how-to-use-built-in-proxy-object-in-javascript-3kh1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; object allows you to add custom get, set, delete behaviour on your existing object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one useful way of using &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt;, which will allow us to &lt;strong&gt;query json array with value rather than index&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// our array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;789&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;tablet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;laptop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// define custom hooks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create proxy object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;customItems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;handlers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now you can access our array with name instead of index 😀&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;customItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;laptop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logs =&amp;gt; { id: '1011', name: 'laptop'}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can play with the above code here :-&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="runkit-element"&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
    
  &lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
    // our array
const items = [
    {
        id: '123',
        name: 'phone'
    },
    {
        id: '789',
        name: 'tablet'
    },
    {
        id: '1011',
        name: 'laptop'
    }
]

// define custom hooks
const handlers = {
    get: (target, prop) =&amp;gt; {
        return target.find(item =&amp;gt; item.name === prop)
    }
}

// create proxy object
const customItems = new Proxy(items, handlers)

// now you can access our array with name instead of index 😀
console.log(customItems['laptop'])
// logs =&amp;gt; { id: '1011', name: 'laptop'}


  &lt;/code&gt;

      <title>Making digital currency; How to create a new cryptocurrency</title>
      <author>martin tyeman</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 15:41:53 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/martintyeman/making-digital-currency-how-to-create-a-new-cryptocurrency-30b</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many startups have made a lot of money by creating a digital currency and selling tokens in the initial public offering. Creating a new digital currency may seem like an impossible process to most people. While making digital currency is possible if you have enough knowledge in this field. In this article, we will introduce you to the methods of making a digital currency and at the end, we will answer some common questions in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are new digital currencies being created?&lt;br&gt;
Even if virtual money has been available to the public for a long time, Bitcoin is the first known and most successful cryptocurrency in the cryptocurrency market. Many cryptocurrencies have been created today, the most popular of which are Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some unique features make companies and individuals think about creating cryptocurrencies. The most important features of digital currency are cryptography, security and confidentiality, no need to monitor a central institution, transparency of transactions, fast transactions, and ease of transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-difference-between-coins-and-digital-currency-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The difference between coins and digital currency tokens
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people mistakenly use tokens and quins as synonyms. While Token and Quinn are different. The most important thing that distinguishes a token from a quin is the lack of an independent blockchain. Tokens are created on the platform of other blockchains. But Quinn has an independent blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important difference between coins and tokens is that coins are used to buy and sell and are considered a method of payment. While most tokens can be used for use in an application or as an asset. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Lite Coin are the most popular coins in the digital currency market. Tetra, Chainlink, Dai, and Avi are also in the category of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#digital-currency-making-training-introducing-3-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Digital currency making training; Introducing 3 methods
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-one-create-a-new-digital-currency-by-creating-tokens"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method one: Create a new digital currency by creating tokens
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make digital currency is to create tokens. As we have said, a token is a digital currency that does not have its independent blockchain and has been created and launched in the context of another blockchain. For this reason, when a token is generated, there is no need to work on the rules of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making tokens is cost-effective for blockchain developers because they do not need the astronomical cost of designing a blockchain to achieve their goals. Of course, it is also important to note that many digital currencies, when in their infancy, are implemented on another blockchain platform to save costs, but once they have been sufficiently developed, a dedicated blockchain for They are used to launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The token can be created on all blockchain platforms that use smart contracts. Ethereum is one of the most popular token-building platforms. At the time of writing, Ethereum has hosted more than 80% of the tokens on the market. Binance Chain, Ias, Kazmas, Thezos, and Tron are other common platforms for making tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum's programming language is solidity. Solidarity uses concepts that exist in other programming languages ​​such as PHP. It is a high-level programming language that has all the capabilities and capabilities needed for blockchain software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-2-create-digital-currency-by-copying-and-modifying-current-blockchains"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 2: Create digital currency by copying and modifying current blockchains
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to build digital currency is to use open-source blockchains. Open source blocks are made available to the public with programming code after they are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum and Bitcoin programming codes are also open source and can be accessed by anyone on GitHub. Many blockchains have been launched following the example of these two digital currencies. For example, by making a few changes to the Bitcoin blockchain, the LiteCoin network is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#method-3-create-a-digital-currency-by-creating-a-new-blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Method 3: Create a digital currency by creating a new blockchain
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build digital currency through the new blockchain&lt;br&gt;
Building and designing a blockchain network is another way to create a new digital currency. In a blockchain, data is stored in blocks and forms an interconnected chain. This structure creates an immutable storage system. The blocks are connected using hashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new blockchain requires deep programming knowledge and a lot of time. In the following, the steps of creating a new digital currency through making blockchain are outlined in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the consensus mechanism&lt;br&gt;
Consensus mechanisms are protocols for verifying transactions performed in blockchain without the need for a third party (intermediary). Proof of work and the stock proof is currently the most well-known and basic blockchain consensus mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the blockchain platform&lt;br&gt;
The correct choice of blockchain platform depends on the consensus mechanism you have chosen. The best blockchain operating systems are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum&lt;br&gt;
Waves (WAVES)&lt;br&gt;
Hyperledger Fabric&lt;br&gt;
NEM&lt;br&gt;
IBM blockchain&lt;br&gt;
Nxt (NXT)&lt;br&gt;
HydraChain&lt;br&gt;
BlockStarter&lt;br&gt;
BigChainDB&lt;br&gt;
EOS&lt;br&gt;
Quorum&lt;br&gt;
IOTA&lt;br&gt;
CoinList&lt;br&gt;
MultiChain&lt;br&gt;
Open chain&lt;br&gt;
Chain Core&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design the nodes&lt;br&gt;
You need to decide how the blockchain works and design the nodes accordingly. For example, will the licenses be private or public? Will the hosting be on-premises web systems or cloud systems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specify the blockchain architecture&lt;br&gt;
Before launching a digital currency, you need to be sure of all aspects; Because you can not change multiple blockchain parameters after startup. For example, you need to specify what address blockchain will follow to track exchanges of different cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design the user interface&lt;br&gt;
If your user interface is not good, the cipher project will fail. You need to make sure you are using the latest version of FTP servers, databases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frequently-asked-questions-about-making-new-digital-currencies"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frequently Asked Questions about Making New Digital Currencies
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does making a digital currency always lead to profitability?&lt;br&gt;
No. More than a few hundred thousand digital currencies have been launched on various platforms, many of which have failed. For this reason, all aspects of work must be well weighed before creating a digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the reason for the failure of some new digital currencies?&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, this perspective often causes us to become overwhelmed when it's time to start a new digital currency. That's why we see so many teams being forgotten after spending so much money and energy to create a new digital currency, without gaining popularity. One of the main reasons for their failure is that they failed to do good marketing. Therefore, before any action, the marketing system must be well defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the first step in building a new digital currency?&lt;br&gt;
The first step in creating a new digital currency is to have a well-defined digital currency white paper. White paper in the world of digital currencies means a comprehensive and complete report of the problem that the introduced project seeks to solve. Project objectives should be clearly defined within the white paper. A standard and complete white paper include an abstract, introduction, problem definition, product description, technical details, descriptions of the new digital currency, details of the public offering, and introduction of the development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost to create a new digital currency?&lt;br&gt;
Creating new passwords is not an easy task and will probably require some financial resources; Unless you can handle things like development, documentation, and marketing. The cost of building an encrypted currency depends on several factors, and no specific number can be specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#concluding-remarks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Concluding remarks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a new dedicated currency may seem like an attractive and profitable offer at first, but we must not forget that there are many challenges in this direction. For this reason, sufficient market research must be done before any action is taken. On the other hand, the necessary capital must be provided for manufacturing and marketing. Otherwise, the digital currency project is likely to fail in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dockerizing a Node.js web application</title>
      <author>Ada Cheng</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 15:11:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/adafycheng/dockerizing-a-nodejs-web-application-2hha</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adafycheng/dockerizing-a-nodejs-web-application-2hha</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I would like to document how I dockerize my portfolio web site, which is a Node.js application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#build-the-nodejs-application"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Build the Node.js application
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, create Dockerfile for the Node.js application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight docker"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; node:14.18.2-alpine3.14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; /app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; package.json ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; package-lock.json ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ./ ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;npm i
&lt;span class="k"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; ["npm", "run", "start"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since I've used &lt;em&gt;node-sass&lt;/em&gt; package for enabling SASS in my application and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/"&gt;the package supports limited Node.js version&lt;/a&gt;, I need to find the right &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/node"&gt;node.js docker image at &lt;strong&gt;docker hub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iXfnroIy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p6aeeb0a8z8u4stg4ttv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iXfnroIy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p6aeeb0a8z8u4stg4ttv.png" alt="Supported Environments by node-sass package" width="880" height="559"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;docker hub&lt;/em&gt;, search for the right image in the &lt;em&gt;Tags&lt;/em&gt; tab.  Once the desired image is found, put it on the first line (i.e. the FROM layer) of the Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FWPR2V3E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cvhakovvfa7q1mvxg282.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FWPR2V3E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cvhakovvfa7q1mvxg282.png" alt="Node.js docker images" width="880" height="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, build the Node.js application.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, build docker image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Make sure Docker Engine is running in your development environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker build &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; Dockerfile &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; portfolio-website &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deployment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy by exposing port 5001 instead of default port 3000 (you can change to any port according to your environment).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 5001:3000 portfolio-website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#verification"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Verification
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that the web application is running by opening &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:5001/&lt;/code&gt; in a web browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f79VFQFv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1jfnn5mrob03bzjzjvwt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f79VFQFv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1jfnn5mrob03bzjzjvwt.png" alt="Dockerized Node.js application" width="880" height="527"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to fix "Property 'ethereum' does not exist on type 'Window &amp; typeof globalThis'.ts(2339)"</title>
      <author>Nmurgor</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 14:50:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/nmurgor/how-to-fix-property-ethereum-does-not-exist-on-type-window-typeof-globalthists2339-42dh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/nmurgor/how-to-fix-property-ethereum-does-not-exist-on-type-window-typeof-globalthists2339-42dh</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with MetaMask APIs, you might encounter this warning: "Property 'ethereum' does not exist on type 'Window &amp;amp; typeof globalThis'.ts(2339)"  when accessing &lt;code&gt;window.ethereum&lt;/code&gt; in a TypeScript project. MetaMask injects a global API into websites visited by its users at &lt;code&gt;window.ethereum&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_rl5z7lp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://naftalimurgor.netflify.app/static/img/error-ethereum-does-not-exist.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_rl5z7lp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://naftalimurgor.netflify.app/static/img/error-ethereum-does-not-exist.png" alt="a code snippet screenshot" width="" height=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this warning, and corresponding compile error, add this declaration at the top level of your file, after imports.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note, this is not the best fix as this temporarily fixes the warning by telling the &lt;code&gt;TypeScript&lt;/code&gt; compiler to treat &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; as of type &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt; hence ignore any warnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sacrifices also any  IntelliSense and auto-completion provided by code editor on the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIldsycnma5sHR1VRP38vhg"&gt;Nicko16&lt;/a&gt;, a Blender YouTuber, uploaded in 2020 a short tutorial about how to Import Google Maps 3D Data into Blender, using the RenderDoc Blender add-on. Basicly, it import 3d models and building from google map with &lt;a href="https://github.com/eliemichel/MapsModelsImporter/releases"&gt;MapsModelsImporter&lt;/a&gt; developed by Élie Michel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18th November 2021, UPDATE, I can confirm this is working with: &lt;br&gt;
Blender v2.93.6 &lt;br&gt;
RenderDoc v1.16&lt;br&gt;
MapsModelImporter v0.4.0  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ruby 3 Mindset, what's new ?</title>
      <author>Shayan Holakouee</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 14:17:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shayanholakouee/ruby-3-mindset-whats-new--1kh9</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shayanholakouee/ruby-3-mindset-whats-new--1kh9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The number 3 is very significant in the Ruby 3 release. Be it release version number, making performance 3x faster, or the trio of core contributors(Matz, TenderLove, Koichi). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there were 3 major goals of Ruby 3: being faster, having better concurrency, and ensuring correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby 3’s main selling point is that it’s 3 times faster than Ruby 2. Matz and the team have been trying to bring in a lot of features in the latest version of Ruby, but their foremost priority has been to ensure that performance is improved drastically, and that backward compatibility is maintained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a whole bunch of new additions like type checking, ractor, and scheduler, along with improvements to the currently existing paradigms, like performance, fibers, memory, concurrency, and static analysis. We’ll take a deeper look at each one of them one-by-one.&lt;br&gt;
One of the most promising updates for Ruby CPU performance is the new Ruby JIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that might significantly improve the programming language’s performance is the Medium Internal Representation JIT compiler, which is lightweight and convenient to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that this Ruby updates will actually be included in Ruby 3.0 since it might solve Ruby’s issues and result in significant performance improvement beyond the current JIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of a new big number is that it breaks stuff from previous releases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final note: In order to manage projects developed on different versions of Ruby, you’ll want a version manager to allow you to easily switch back and forth. I’ve used rbenv; I’m also aware of chruby and RVM that are frequently recommended and accomplish the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Storage Best Practices for Data and Analytics Applications | AWS White Paper Summary</title>
      <author>Adit Modi</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 14:10:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/awsmenacommunity/storage-best-practices-for-data-and-analytics-applications-aws-white-paper-summary-3cmd</link>

      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier (Amazon S3 Glacier) provide ideal storage solutions for data lakes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data lakes, powered by Amazon S3, provide you with unmatched availability, agility, and flexibility required to combine different types of data and analytics approaches to gain deeper insights, in ways that traditional data silos and data warehouses cannot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, data lakes built on Amazon S3 integrate with other analytical services for ingestion, inventory, transformation, and security of your data in the data lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide explains each of these options and provides best practices for building, securing, managing, and scaling a data lake built on Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because organizations are collecting and analyzing increasing amounts of data, traditional on-premises solutions for data storage, data management, and analytics can no longer keep pace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data silos that aren’t built to work well together make it difficult to consolidate the storage for more comprehensive and efficient analytics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, limits an organization’s agility and ability to derive more insights and value from its data. In addition, this reduces the capability to seamlessly adopt more sophisticated analytics tools and processes, because it necessitates upskilling of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A data lake is an architectural approach that allows you to store all your data in a centralized repository, so that it can be categorized, catalogued, secured, and analyzed by a diverse set of users and tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a data lake you can ingest and store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and transform these raw data assets as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a cloud-based data lake you can easily decouple the compute from storage, and scale each component independently, which is a huge advantage over an on-premises or Hadoop-based data lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use a complete portfolio of data exploration, analytics, machine learning, reporting, and visualization tools on the data. A data lake makes data and the optimal analytics tools available to more users, across more lines of business, enabling them to get all of the business insights they need, whenever they need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More organizations are building data lakes for various use cases. To guide customers in their journey, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has developed a data lake architecture that allows you to build scalable, secure data lake solutions cost-effectively using Amazon S3 and other AWS services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the data lake built on Amazon S3 architecture capabilities you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingest and store data from a wide variety of sources into a centralized platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a comprehensive data catalog to find and use data assets stored in the data lake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure, protect, and manage all of the data stored in the data lake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tools and policies to monitor, analyze, and optimize infrastructure and data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transform raw data assets in place into optimized usable formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query data assets in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate the unstructured data assets from Amazon S3 with structured data assets in a data warehouse solution to gather valuable business insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store the data assets into separate buckets as the data goes through extraction, transformation, and load process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a broad and deep portfolio of data analytics, data science, machine learning, and visualization tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly integrate current and future third-party data-processing tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securely share processed datasets and results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale virtually to unlimited capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this paper provides more information about each of these capabilities. The following figure illustrates a sample AWS data lake platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;em&gt;High-level AWS data lake technical reference architecture&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#central-storage-amazon-s3-as-the-data-lake-storage-platform"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Central storage: Amazon S3 as the data lake storage platform
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A data lake built on AWS uses Amazon S3 as its primary storage platform. Amazon S3 provides an optimal foundation for a data lake because of its virtually unlimited scalability and high durability. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can seamlessly and non-disruptively increase storage from gigabytes to petabytes of content, paying only for what you use. Amazon S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% durability. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has scalable performance, ease-of-use features, native encryption, and access control capabilities. Amazon S3 integrates with a broad portfolio of AWS and third-party ISV tools for data ingestion, data processing, and data security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key data lake-enabling features of Amazon S3 include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Decoupling of storage from compute and data processing&lt;/strong&gt; – In traditional Hadoop and data warehouse solutions, storage and compute are tightly coupled, making it difficult to optimize costs and data processing workflows. With Amazon S3, you can cost-effectively store all data types in their native formats. You can then launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to run analytical tools, and use services in AWS analytics portfolio, such as Amazon Athena, AWS Lambda, Amazon EMR, and Amazon QuickSight, to process your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Centralized data architecture&lt;/strong&gt; – Amazon S3 makes it easy to build a multi-tenant environment, where multiple users can run different analytical tools against the same copy of the data. This improves both cost and data governance over that of traditional solutions, which require multiple copies of data to be distributed across multiple processing platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;S3 Cross-Region Replication:&lt;/strong&gt; – You can use Cross-Region Replication to copy your objects across S3 buckets within the same account or even with a different account. Cross-Region Replication is particularly useful in meeting compliance requirements, minimizing latency by storing the objects closer to the user location, and improving operational efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Integration with clusterless and serverless AWS services&lt;/strong&gt; – You can use Amazon S3 with Athena, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, and AWS Glue to query and process data. Amazon S3 also integrates with AWS Lambda serverless computing to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can process event notifications from S3 through AWS Lambda, such as when an object is created or deleted from a bucket. With all of these capabilities, you only pay for the actual amounts of data you process or for the compute time that you consume. For machine learning use cases, you need to store the model training data and the model artifacts generated during model training. Amazon SageMaker integrates seamlessly with Amazon S3, so you can store the model training data and model artifacts on a single or different S3 bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Standardized APIs&lt;/strong&gt; – Amazon S3 RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs) are simple, easy to use, and supported by most major third-party independent software vendors (ISVs), including leading Apache Hadoop and analytics tool vendors. This allows customers to bring the tools they are most comfortable with and knowledgeable about to help them perform analytics on data in Amazon S3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Secure by default&lt;/strong&gt; – Amazon S3 is secure by default. Amazon S3 supports user authentication to control access to data. It provides access control mechanisms such as bucket policies and access-control lists to provide fine-grained access to data stored in S3 buckets to specific users and groups of users. You can also manage the access to shared data within Amazon S3 using S3 Access Points. More details about S3 Access Points are included in the Securing, protecting, and managing data section. You can also securely access data stored in S3 through SSL endpoints using HTTPS protocol. An additional layer of security can be implemented by encrypting the data-in-transit and data-at-rest using server-side encryption (SSE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon S3 for storage of raw and iterative data sets&lt;/strong&gt; – When working with a data lake, the data undergoes various transformations. With extract, transform, load (ETL) processes and analytical operations, various versions of the same data sets are created or required for advanced processing. You can create different layers for storing the data based on the stage of the pipeline, such as raw, transformed, curated, and logs. Within these layers you can also create additional tiers based on the sensitivity of the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage classes for cost savings, durability, and availability&lt;/strong&gt; – Amazon S3 provides a range of storage classes for various use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;S3 Standard&lt;/strong&gt; – General purpose storage for frequently accessed data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;S3 Standard Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone – IA)&lt;/strong&gt; – Infrequently accessed, long lived data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive&lt;/strong&gt; – Long-term archival of data.
Using S3 Lifecycle policy, you can move the data across different storage classes for compliance and cost optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and support for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data&lt;/strong&gt; – Amazon S3 is a petabyte scale object store which provides virtually unlimited scalability to store any type of data. You can store structured data (such as relational data), semi-structured data (such as JSON, XML, and CSV files), and unstructured data (such as images or media files). This feature makes Amazon S3 the appropriate storage solution for your cloud data lake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-ingestion-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data ingestion methods
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core capability of a data lake architecture is the ability to quickly and easily ingest multiple types of data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time streaming data and bulk data assets, from on-premises storage platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structured data generated and processed by legacy on-premises platforms - mainframes and data warehouses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unstructured and semi-structured data – images, text files, audio and video, and graphs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS provides services and capabilities to ingest different types of data into your data lake built on Amazon S3 depending on your use case. This section provides an overview of various ingestion services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#amazon-kinesis-data-firehose"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is part of the Kinesis family of services that makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale. Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data directly to data lakes (Amazon S3), data stores, and analytical services for further processing. Kinesis Data Firehose automatically scales to match the volume and throughput of streaming data, and requires no ongoing administration. Kinesis Data Firehose can also be configured to transform streaming data before it’s stored in a data lake built on Amazon S3. Its transformation capabilities include compression, encryption, data batching, and Lambda functions. Kinesis Data Firehose integrates with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka to deliver the streaming data into destinations, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and third-party solutions such as Splunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinesis Data Firehose can convert your input JSON data to Apache Parquet and Apache ORC before storing the data into your data lake built on Amazon S3. Parquet and Orc being columnar data formats, help save space and allow faster queries on the stored data compared to row-based formats such as JSON. Kinesis Data Firehose can compress data before it’s stored in Amazon S3. It currently supports GZIP, ZIP, and SNAPPY compression formats. GZIP is the preferred format because it can be used by Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinesis Data Firehose also allows you to invoke Lambda functions to perform transformations on the input data. Using Lambda blueprints, you can transform the input comma-separated values (CSV), structured text, such as Apache Log and Syslog formats, into JSON first. You can optionally store the source data to another S3 bucket. The following figure illustrates the data flow between Kinesis Data Firehose and different destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinesis Data Firehose also provides the ability to group and partition the target files using custom prefixes such as dates for S3 objects. This facilitates faster querying by the use of the partitioning and incremental processing further with the same feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l19Yd49H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8kved0are5bnt9m9prmm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--l19Yd49H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8kved0are5bnt9m9prmm.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering real-time streaming data with Kinesis Data Firehose to different destinations with optional backup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinesis Data Firehose also natively integrates with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics which provides you with an efficient way to analyze and transform streaming data using Apache Flink and SQL applications. Apache Flink is an open-source framework and engine for processing streaming data using Java and Scala. Using Kinesis Data Analytics, you can develop applications to perform time series analytics, feed real-time dashboards, and create real-time metrics. You can also use Kinesis Data Analytics for transforming the incoming stream and create a new data stream that can be written back into Kinesis Data Firehose before it is delivered to a destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Kinesis Data Firehose encryption supports Amazon S3 server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encrypting delivered data in your data lake built on Amazon S3. You can choose not to encrypt the data or to encrypt the data with a key from the list of AWS KMS keys that you own (refer to the Data encryption with Amazon S3 and AWS KMS section of this document). Kinesis Data Firehose can concatenate multiple incoming records, and then deliver them to Amazon S3 as a single S3 object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important capability because it reduces the load of Amazon S3 transaction costs and transactions per second. You can grant your application access to send data to Kinesis Data Firehose using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Using IAM, you can also grant Kinesis Data Firehose access to S3 buckets, Amazon Redshift cluster, or Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster. You can also use Kinesis Data Firehose with virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints (AWS PrivateLink). AWS PrivateLink is an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IPs in your Amazon VPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-snow-family"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Snow Family
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Snow Family, comprised of AWS Snowcone, AWS Snowball, and AWS Snowmobile, offers hardware devices of varying capacities for movement of data from on-premises locations to AWS. The devices also offer cloud computing capabilities at the edge for the applications that need to perform computations closer to the source of the data. Using Snowcone you can transfer data generated continuously from sensors, IoT devices, and machines, to the AWS Cloud. Snowcone features 8 TB of storage. Snowball and Snowmobile are used to transfer massive amounts of data up to 100 PB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snowball moves terabytes of data into your data lake built on Amazon S3. You can use it to transfer databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, historic logs, IoT sensor data, and media content, especially in situations where network conditions hinder transfer of large amounts of data both into and out of AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Snow Family uses physical storage devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and your data lake built on Amazon S3. You can use AWS Storage Optimized Snowball to securely and efficiently migrate bulk data from on-premises storage platforms and Hadoop clusters. Snowball supports encryption and uses AES-256-bit encryption. Encryption keys are never shipped with the Snowball device, so the data transfer process is highly secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is transferred from the Snowball device to your data lake built on Amazon S3 and stored as S3 objects in their original or native format. Snowball also has a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) client, so data may be migrated directly from Hadoop clusters into an S3 bucket in its native format. Snowball devices can be particularly useful for migrating terabytes of data from data centers and locations with intermittent internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-glue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Glue
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Glue is a fully managed serverless ETL service that makes it easier to categorize, clean, transform, and reliably transfer data between different data stores in a simple and cost-effective way. The core components of AWS Glue consists of a central metadata repository known as AWS Glue Data Catalog which is a drop-in replacement for an Apache Hive metastore (refer to the Catalog and search section of this document for more information) and an ETL job system that automatically generates Python and Scala code and manages ETL jobs. The following figure depicts the high-level architecture of an AWS Glue environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UUlQrS2p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w6o2oqe6c5kb59yulsu0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--UUlQrS2p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w6o2oqe6c5kb59yulsu0.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="634"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Architecture of an AWS Glue environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ETL the data from source to target, you create a job in AWS Glue, which involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can run an ETL job, define a crawler and point it to the data source to identify the table definition and the metadata required to run the ETL job. The metadata and the table definitions are stored in the Data Catalog. The data source can be an AWS service, such as Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or Kinesis Data Streams, as well as a third-party JDBC-accessible database. Similarly, a data target can be an AWS service, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility), as well as a third-party JDBC-accessible database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either provide a script to perform the ETL job, or AWS Glue can generate the script automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the job on-demand or use the scheduler component that helps in initiating the job in response to an event and schedule at a defined time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the job is run, the script extracts the data from the source, transforms the data, and finally loads the data into the data target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-datasync"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS DataSync
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that helps in moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services, as well as between different AWS storage services. You can automate the data movement between on-premises Network File Systems (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), or a self-managed object store to your data lake built on Amazon S3. DataSync allows data encryption and data integrity validation to ensure safe and secure transfer of data. DataSync also has support for an HDFS connector to read directly from on-premises Hadoop clusters and replicate your data to your data lake built on Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-transfer-family"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Transfer Family
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed and secure transfer service that helps you to move files into and out of AWS storage services (for example, your data lake built on Amazon S3 storage and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Network File System (NFS)). AWS Transfer Family supports Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (FTP), FTP Secure (FTPS), and FTP. You can use AWS Transfer Family to ingest data into your data lakes built on Amazon S3 from third parties, such as vendors and partners, to perform an internal transfer within the organization, and distribute subscription-based data to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#storage-gateway"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Storage Gateway
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage Gateway can be used to integrate legacy on-premises data processing platforms with a data lake built on Amazon S3. The File Gateway configuration of Storage Gateway offers on-premises devices and applications a network file share through an NFS connection. Files written to this mount point are converted to objects stored in Amazon S3 in their original format without any proprietary modification. This means that you can integrate applications and platforms that don’t have native Amazon S3 capabilities—such as on-premises lab equipment, mainframe computers, databases, and data warehouses—with S3 buckets, and then use analytical tools such as Amazon EMR or Amazon Athena to process this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Hadoop distributed copy command&lt;br&gt;
Amazon S3 natively supports distributed copy (DistCp), which is a standard Apache Hadoop data transfer mechanism. This allows you to run DistCp jobs to transfer data from an on-premises Hadoop cluster to an S3 bucket. The command to transfer data is similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hadoop distcp hdfs://source-folder s3a://destination-bucket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-direct-connect"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Direct Connect
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Direct Connect establishes a dedicated network connection between your on-premises internal network and AWS. AWS Direct Connect links the internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber optic cable. Using the dedicated connection, you can create virtual interface directly with Amazon S3, which can be used to securely transfer data from on-premises into a data lake built on Amazon S3 for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#aws-database-migration-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  AWS Database Migration Service
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) facilitates the movement of data from various data stores such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and other data stores into AWS. AWS DMS allows one-time migration and ongoing replication (change data capture) to keep the source and target data stores in sync. Using AWS DMS, you can use Amazon S3 as a target for the supported database sources. AWS DMS task for Amazon S3 writes both full load migration and change data capture (CDC) in a comma separated value (CSV) format by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also write the data into Apache Parquet format (parquet) for more compact storage and faster query options. Both CSV and parquet formats are favorable for in-place querying using services such as Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum (refer to the In-place querying section of this document for more information). As mentioned earlier, Parquet format is recommended for analytical querying. It is useful to use AWS DMS to migrate databases from on-premises to or across different AWS accounts to your data lake built on Amazon S3 during initial data transfer or on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-lake-foundation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data lake foundation
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 provides the foundation for building a data lake, along with integration to other services that can be tailored to your business needs. A common challenge faced by users when building a data lake is the categorization of data and maintaining data across different stages as it goes through the transformation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following figure depicts a sample data lake and the transformation journey data goes through in its lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wK_Z23UI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/te77tojtxewpsownb1ba.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wK_Z23UI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/te77tojtxewpsownb1ba.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="520"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sample data lake transformation journey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides a recommended bucket strategy for building a data lake foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A data lake can be broadly categorized across four distinct buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raw data – Data ingested from the data sources in the raw data format, which is the immutable copy of the data. This can include structured, semi structured, and unstructured data objects such as databases, backups, archives, JSON, CSV, XML, text files, or images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transformed – This bucket consists of transformed data normalized to a specific use case for performance improvement and cost reduction. In this stage, data can be transformed into columnar data formats, such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC, which can be used by Amazon Athena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curated –The transformed data can be further enriched by blending it with other data sets to provide additional insights. This layer typically contains S3 objects which are optimized for analytics, reporting using Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, and loading into massively parallel processing data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs – This bucket stores process logs for Amazon S3, and other services in the data lake architecture. The logs can include S3 access logs, CloudWatch logs, or CloudTrail logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table shows a recommended sample folder structure for your data lake per environment. Each environment can have the same folder structure with tags to segregate across each environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended sample folder structure for your data lake per environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended you follow best practices when defining your bucket strategy for your data lake built on Amazon S3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckets names must be unique within a partition. Currently there are three partitions (aws – Standard Regions, aws-cn – China Regions, aws-us-gov – AWS GoveCloud US Regions); however, names can be reused after the buckets are deleted (with several exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleted bucket names are not available to reuse immediately; hence, if users want to use a particular bucket name, they should not delete the bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All bucket names across all AWS Regions should comply with DNS naming conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckets can store an unlimited number of objects in a bucket without impacting performance. The objects can be stored in a single bucket or across multiple buckets; however, you cannot create a bucket from within another bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production S3 buckets should be hosted under a different AWS account, separate from non-production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Build an automatic ingestion mechanism to catalog and create the multiple layers of data storage including Raw, Transformed, and Curated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider building automatic data classification rules based on schema and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider additional folders within the data lakes, such as reports, downstream applications, or user folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enable versioning, if needed, for protection from accidental deletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use separate buckets for S3 data which needs to be replicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#catalog-and-search"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Catalog and search
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest challenges that inhibited building a data lake were keeping track of all of the raw assets as they were loaded into the data lake, and then tracking all of the new data assets and versions that were created by data transformation, data processing, and analytics. Thus, an essential component of a data lake built on Amazon S3 is the Data Catalog. The Data Catalog provides an interface to query all assets stored in data lake S3 buckets. The Data Catalog is designed to provide a single source of truth about the contents of the data lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Glue&lt;br&gt;
AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service that makes it easier to categorize, clean, transform, and reliably transfer data between different data stores. The AWS Glue Data Catalog, acomponent of AWS Glue, provides a unified metadata repository for performing analytical operations across various data sources, such as Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum, and any application that is compatible with a Hive metastore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a Data Catalog, use AWS Glue crawlers that crawl the data from the data sources as registered with AWS Glue in the AWS Management Console. The data source can be an S3 bucket, a table in Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, or Amazon Redshift, or any external database that supports JDBC connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can define custom classifiers or use the built-in classifiers provided by AWS Glue to classify the data. AWS Glue provides classifiers for common file types, such as CSV, JSON, AVRO, or XML. AWS Glue also provides classifiers for common relational database management systems using a JDBC connection. You can create a custom classifier using a grok pattern, an XML tag, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), or comma-separated values (CSV). The following figure depicts the working of AWS Glue in building a Data Catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_Z_I8z6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6kxtmjtg4n1vubd8aqj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N_Z_I8z6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6kxtmjtg4n1vubd8aqj.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="612"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;AWS Glue Data Catalog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Catalog is a database that stores metadata in tables consisting of data schema, data location, and runtime metrics. Data Catalog is also Apache Hive metastore compatible that can be used as a central repository for storing structural and operational metadata. AWS Glue also provides out-of-box integration with Amazon EMR that allows you to use Data Catalog as an external Hive metastore. Data Catalog is recommended, especially when you need a persistent metastore or a metastore shared between different applications, services, clusters, or AWS accounts. Data Catalog can also be used to create an external table for Athena or Amazon Redshift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Lake Formation&lt;br&gt;
AWS Lake Formation helps to easily build, secure, and manage data lakes. Lake Formation provides centralized governance and access control for the data in a data lake built on S3, and controls access to the data through various services, such as AWS Glue, Athena, Amazon Redshift Spectrum, Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon EMR. AWS Lake Formation can connect to an S3 bucket and orchestrate a dataflow that can ingest, clean, transform, and organize the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lake Formation uses AWS Glue Data Catalog to automatically classify data in data lakes, data sources, transforms, and targets. Apart from the metadata, the Data Catalog also stores information consisting of resource links to shared databases and tables in external accounts for cross account access to the data in a data lake built on S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lake Formation provides you with a grant/revoke permission model to control access to Data Catalog resources (consisting of database and metadata tables), S3 buckets and underlying data in these buckets. Lake Formation permissions along with IAM policies provide granular access to the data stored in data lakes built on S3. These permissions can be used to share Data Catalog resources with external AWS accounts. The users from these accounts can run jobs and queries by combining data from multiple data catalogs across multiple accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive data catalog&lt;br&gt;
You have the flexibility to create a comprehensive data catalog using standard AWS services such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Amazon OpenSearch Service. At a high level, AWS Lambda triggers are used to populate DynamoDB tables with object names and metadata when those objects are put into S3; Amazon OpenSearch Service is used to search for specific assets, related metadata, and data classifications. The following figure shows a high-level architectural overview of this solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qkJPKVmt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uedb6o0nsurt6htytboc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qkJPKVmt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uedb6o0nsurt6htytboc.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="281"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Comprehensive data catalog using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Amazon OpenSearch Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#transforming-data-assets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Transforming data assets
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core value of a data lake is that it is the collection point and repository for all of an organization’s data assets, regardless of their native formats. This allows quick ingestion, elimination of data duplication and data sprawl, and centralized governance and management. After the data assets are collected, they need to be transformed into normalized formats to be used by a variety of data analytics and processing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to ‘democratizing’ the data and making the data lake available to the widest number of users of varying skill sets and responsibilities is to transform data assets into a format that allows for efficient one-time SQL querying. Data transformation or ETL process prepares the data to be consumed by downstream systems for advanced analytics, visualizations and business reporting, or machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step involves extracting information from the different data sources which was discussed in the Data ingestion methods section. The data is stored in a raw bucket (refer to the Data lake foundation section of this document). After you have the data, you need to transform it. Transformations might involve aggregating the data from different sources or changing the file format of the data received, such as from CSV to Parquet format to reduce the file size and optimize the Athena query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can compress the files or convert the data format from string to double, or number to date format. After the transformation is complete, the data can be written into transformed bucket (refer to the Data lake foundation section of this document) which is then further used by the downstream systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to transform data assets, and the “best” way often comes down to the nature of the analytics application, individual preference, skill sets, and the tools available. When a data lake is built on AWS, there is a wide variety of tools and services available for data transformation, so you can pick the methods and tools that best suits your purpose. Because the data lake is inherently multi-tenant, multiple data transformation jobs using different tools can run concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common and straightforward methods to transform data assets into Parquet in a data lake built on S3 using Amazon EMR clusters. The first method involves creating an Amazon EMR cluster with Hive installed using the raw data assets in Amazon S3 as input, transforming those data assets into Hive tables, and then writing those Hive tables back out to Amazon S3 in Parquet format. The second method is to use Spark on Amazon EMR. With this method, a typical transformation can be achieved with only 20 lines of PySpark code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third data transformation method on a data lake built on S3 is to use AWS Glue. AWS Glue simplifies and automates difficult and time-consuming data discovery, conversion, mapping, and job scheduling tasks. AWS Glue guides you through the process of transforming and moving your data assets with an easy-to-use console that helps you understand your data sources, transform and prepare these data assets for analytics, and load them reliably from S3 data sources back into S3 destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Glue automatically crawls raw data assets in your data lake’s S3 buckets, identifies data formats, and then suggests schemas and transformations so that you don’t have to spend time hand coding data flows. You can then edit these transformations, if necessary, using the tools and technologies you already know, such as Python, Spark, Git, and your favorite integrated developer environment, and then share them with other AWS Glue users of the data lake. AWS Glue’s flexible job scheduler can be set up to run data transformation flows on a recurring basis, in response to triggers, or even in response to AWS Lambda events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Glue automatically and transparently provisions hardware resources, and distributes ETL jobs on Apache Spark nodes so that ETL run times remain consistent as data volume grows. AWS Glue coordinates the implementation of data lake jobs in the right sequence, and automatically retries failed jobs. With AWS Glue, there are no servers or clusters to manage, and you pay only for the resources consumed by your ETL jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Lambda functions can also be used for transforming the data stored in your data lake built on Amazon S3. Lambda functions can respond to event notifications from Amazon S3 when an object is created or deleted. You can configure a Lambda function to perform an action asynchronously, based on the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data is stored in a data lake built on S3, you can share the data with multiple applications. These applications can vary in nature and purpose (for example, ecommerce applications, analytics applications, and marketing applications) and necessitate a different view for each application. S3 Object Lambda can be used to add your own code to process the data retrieved before returning it to an application (for example, masking the personally identifiable information (PII) data or masking credit card information before transferring it to the application).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S3 Object Lambda uses a Lambda function to automatically process and transform the data as it is being retrieved from an S3 bucket. The following figure shows an example of an S3 Object Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WI2BEgEM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n8o27xcdqehxsx3thlse.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WI2BEgEM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n8o27xcdqehxsx3thlse.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="497"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using S3 Object Lambda to transform data before retrieval by applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S3 Object Lambda can be very useful in redacting PII data for analytics applications, format conversion, enriching data from other data sources, resizing objects, or even implementing custom authorization rules to access the data stored in your data lake built on Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another transformation feature that S3 supports natively is batch operations. Using S3 Batch Operations, you can define an operation to be performed on the exabytes of objects stored in your bucket. S3 Batch Operations manages the entire lifecycle of the batch operation by tracking the progress, sending notifications, and storing a detailed completion report for all the operations performed on the objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using S3 Batch Operations, you can copy objects from a bucket into another bucket in the same or different Region, or invoke a Lambda function to transform the object. S3 Batch Operation can also be used to manage the tags defined for the objects and restoring a large number of objects from S3 Glacier. S3 Batch Operation, along with S3 Object Lock, can be used to manage retention dates and legal holds to apply compliance and governance rules for multiple objects at the same time. S3 Object Lock works on the write once read many (WORM) model that can help in prevention of accidental deletion of objects. It can also help in adhering to regulatory controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#inplace-querying"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In-place querying
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important capabilities of a data lake on AWS is the ability to perform in-place transformation and querying of data assets. This allows users to run sophisticated analytical queries directly on their data stored in S3, without having to copy and load data into separate analytics platforms or data warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various tools to perform in-place querying for data stored in a data lake, such as Presto on Amazon EMR and various partner tools. This section provides an overview of serverless services that not only helps perform in-place querying, but also avoids the procurement and management of servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can query S3 data without any additional infrastructure, and only pay for the queries that they run. This makes the ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data accessible to any data lake user who can use SQL, and makes it far more cost effective than the traditional method of performing an ETL process, creating a Hadoop cluster or data warehouse, loading the transformed data into these environments, and then running query jobs. AWS Glue, as described in the previous sections, provides the data discovery and ETL capabilities, and Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum provides the serverless in-place querying capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to in-place querying using Athena and Redshift Spectrum, S3 also provides capabilities to retrieve subset of your data through S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select, that improves the performance of accessing large amounts of data from your data lake built on S3. Using S3 Select, users can run SQL statements to filter and retrieve only a subset of data stored in their data lake. S3 Select operates on objects stored in CSV, JSON, or Apache Parquet format, and other compression formats such as GZIP or BZIP2. Users can also delimit the result set, thus, reducing latency to retrieve the data and optimizing cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Athena&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easier for you to analyze data directly in S3 using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can use Athena directly against data assets stored in the data lake built on S3 and begin using standard SQL to run one-time queries and get results in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage, and you only pay for the volume of data assets scanned during the queries you run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athena scales automatically—running queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. You can use Athena to process unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data sets. Supported data asset formats include CSV, JSON, or columnar data formats such as Apache Parquet and Apache ORC. You can also use Athena to run one-time queries using ANSI SQL without first aggregating or loading the data into Athena. Athena integrates with Amazon QuickSight for easy data visualization. It can also be used with third-party reporting and business intelligence tools by connecting these tools to Athena with a JDBC driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athena also natively integrates with AWS Glue Data Catalog which provides a persistent metadata store for the data stored in S3. You can create the table and use Athena to query the data based on a metadata store that integrates with the ETL and data discovery features of AWS Glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When querying an existing table, Athena uses Presto under the hood, a distributed SQL engine. Athena can also be used to query S3 inventory using standard SQL. Amazon S3 Inventory is an S3 tool to help manage storage. You can use the tool to audit and report on the replication and encryption status of the objects for business, compliance, and regulatory needs. Athena supports querying S3 inventory files in ORC, Parquet, or CSV format. AWS recommends using ORC-formatted or Parquet-formatted inventory files because these formats provide faster query performance and lower query costs. ORC and Parquet formats are columnar formats that allows the reader to read, decompress, and process the columns that are only required for the current query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Redshift Spectrum&lt;br&gt;
Another way to perform in-place querying of data assets in a data lake built on Amazon S3 is to use Amazon Redshift Spectrum. Amazon Redshift is a large-scale, managed data warehouse service that supports massive parallel processing. By contrast, Amazon Redshift allows you to run Redshift SQL queries directly against massive amounts of data—up to exabytes—stored in a data lake built on S3. Amazon Redshift Spectrum applies sophisticated query optimization, scaling processing across thousands of nodes, so results are fast—even with large data sets and complex queries. Amazon Redshift Spectrum can directly query a wide variety of data assets stored in the data lake, including CSV, TSV, Parquet, Sequence, and RCFile. Because Amazon Redshift Spectrum supports the SQL syntax of Amazon Redshift, you can run sophisticated queries using the same business intelligence tools that you use today. You also have the flexibility to run queries that span frequently accessed data assets that are stored locally in Amazon Redshift, and your full data sets stored in S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift share a common data catalog and common data formats, you can use both Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum against the same data assets. You would typically use Athena for one-time data discovery and SQL querying, and then use Amazon Redshift Spectrum for more complex queries and scenarios where a large number of data lake users want to run concurrent business intelligence and reporting workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-broader-analytics-portfolio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The broader analytics portfolio
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a data lake built on AWS, data assets get ingested and stored in one massively scalable, low cost, performant platform. Data discovery, transformation, and SQL querying can all be done in place using innovative AWS services such as AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum. In addition, there are a wide variety of other AWS services that can be directly integrated with S3 to create any number of sophisticated analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence data processing pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to quickly solve a wide range of analytics business challenges on a single platform, against common data assets, without having to worry about provisioning hardware and installing and configuring complex software packages before loading data and performing analytics. Plus, you only pay for what you consume. Some of the most common AWS services that can be used with data assets in a data lake built on S3 are describedin this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EMR&lt;br&gt;
Amazon EMR is a highly distributed computing framework used to quickly and easily process data in a cost-effective manner. Amazon EMR uses Apache Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute data and processing across an elastically resizable cluster of EC2 instances and allows you to use all the common Hadoop tools such as Hive, Pig, Spark, Flink, Hudi, Hue, Livy, MXNet, Presto, TensorFlow, HBase, or Zeppelin. Amazon EMR does all the heavily lifting involved with provisioning, managing, and maintaining the infrastructure and software of a Hadoop cluster, and is integrated directly with S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Amazon EMR, you can launch a persistent cluster that stays up indefinitely or a temporary cluster that ends after the analysis is complete. In either scenario, you only pay for the hours the cluster is up. Amazon EMR supports a variety of EC2 instance types encompassing general purpose, compute, memory, storage I/O optimized, and GPU instances (for example, M6g, C5, R5, Z1, I3, D2, G4, and P3), and all Amazon EC2 pricing options (On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot). The latest version of EMR 6.1.0 (at the time of writing this document) also supports ARM based instance types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Graviton processors are custom built by Amazon Web Services and use 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores to deliver the best price performance. When you launch an Amazon EMR cluster (called a job flow), you choose how many and what type of EC2 instances to provision. Organizations with many different lines of business and a large number of users can build a single data lake solution, store their data assets in S3, and then spin up multiple EMR clusters to share data assets in a multi-tenant fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EMR integrates with S3 for input, output, and intermediate data storage. You can choose the HDFS which runs on a cluster consisting of master and core nodes for processing data that does not need to persist after the lifecycle of the cluster. You can use Amazon EMR file system (EMRFS) using S3 as a data layer for applications running on your cluster. The data can be stored on EMRFS to persist even after the cluster lifecycle. This mechanism helps separate compute and storage, thus enabling you to independently scale the compute and storage depending on the workload. You can scale your compute needs by resizing your cluster, and you can scale your storage needs by using S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon SageMaker&lt;br&gt;
Machine learning is another important data lake use case. Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service that provides a set of features to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. SageMaker provides a suite of built-in algorithms and mechanisms to build custom algorithms based on user requirements. SageMaker also provides an integrated Jupyter notebook instance to prepare and transform the data, develop code for model training, and subsequently deploy, test, and validate the models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SageMaker provides visualization tools and wizards to guide you through the process of creating machine learning models without having to learn complex algorithms and technology. SageMaker can create machine learning models based on datasets stored in your data lake built on S3. SageMaker greatly enhances machine learning capabilities by combining with your data lake built on S3. For training machine learning models, a large amount of data is required, and a data lake backed by S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier provides cost-effective storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon QuickSight&lt;br&gt;
Amazon QuickSight is a fast business analytics service that makes it easy for you to build visualizations, perform targeted analysis, and quickly get business insights from your data assets stored in the data lake, any time, on any device. You can use Amazon QuickSight to seamlessly discover AWS data sources such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Athena, and Amazon S3, connect to any of these data sources and data assets, and get insights from this data in minutes. Amazon QuickSight allows organizations using the data lake to seamlessly scale their business analytics capabilities to hundreds of thousands of users. It delivers fast and responsive query performance by using a Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine (SPICE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon OpenSearch Service&lt;br&gt;
Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service where you can deploy and manage OpenSearch clusters at scale. Common use cases include log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analytics. Amazon OpenSearch Service can be used to add a search box to a website, analyze metrics, security event data, application and infrastructure logs, or store data to automate business workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon OpenSearch Service manages the infrastructure provisioning and maintenance, thus reducing the overhead of managing the Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster yourself. Amazon OpenSearch Service integrates with various open source and native AWS services to provide a seamless experience. Amazon OpenSearch Service integrates with open source Logstash to conveniently upload bulk data into Amazon OpenSearch Service domain and with open source Kibana for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon OpenSearch Service also runs with Kinesis Data Firehose for ingestion of streaming data, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring, respectively. You can also use your data lake built on Amazon S3 to store the streaming data before it is ingested into the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. Ultrawarm storage and Cold storage, types of Amazon OpenSearch Service storage, use Amazon S3 for storing infrequently-accessed read-only data in a cost-efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Securing, protecting, and managing data
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#monitoring-and-optimizing-the-data-lake-environment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Monitoring and optimizing the data lake environment
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the efforts required to architect and build a data lake, your organization must also consider the operational aspects of a data lake, and how to cost-effectively and efficiently operate a production data lake at large scale. Key elements you must consider are monitoring the operations of the data lake, making sure that it meets performance expectations and service-level agreements, analyzing utilization patterns, and using this information to optimize the cost and performance of your data lake. AWS provides multiple features and services to help optimize a data lake that is built on AWS, including S3 storage analytics, Amazon CloudWatch metrics, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon S3 Glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data lake monitoring&lt;br&gt;
A key aspect of operating a data lake environment is understanding how all of the components that comprise the data lake are operating and performing, and generating notifications when issues occur or operational performance falls below predefined thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon CloudWatch&lt;br&gt;
As an administrator, you need to look at the complete data lake environment holistically. This can be achieved using Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS Cloud resources and the applications that run on AWS. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set thresholds, and initiate alarms. This allows you to automatically react to changes in your data lake built on S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use CloudWatch metrics to understand and improve the performance of applications that are using Amazon S3. You can use CloudWatch for generating daily storage metrics for your data lake built on CloudWatch by collecting and processing storage data for your S3 buckets. You can also monitor the requests to your data lake built on S3 and identify and act upon operational issues quickly. In addition, you can also monitor the S3 APIs that are pending replication, total size, and the maximum time required for replication to the destination Region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Macie&lt;br&gt;
Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover, monitor, and protect your sensitive data stored in your data lake. Macie can be used to scan your data lakes and discover sensitive information such as PII or financial data, and identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Macie, you can run a sensitive data discovery job to identify sensitive information using built-in criteria and techniques, such as machine learning and pattern matching called as managed data identifiers, to analyze objects in your data lake. You can also define your own criteria called as custom data identifiers, using regular expressions defining a text pattern to match and, optionally, character sequences and a proximity rule that refines the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after enabled, Macie maintains a complete inventory of your S3 buckets and evaluates and monitors the bucket for security and access control. If Macie detects a potential issue, the service creates a policy finding. Policy findings are generated when policies or settings for S3 bucket are changed in a way that reduces the security of the bucket and its objects. Macie integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon EventBridge, which is a serverless event bus service that can send findings data to services, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), to act on the policy findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS CloudTrail&lt;br&gt;
An operational data lake has many users and multiple administrators, and may be subject to compliance and audit requirements, so it’s important to have a complete audit trail of actions taken and who has performed these actions. AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of AWS accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudTrail continuously monitors and retains events related to API calls across AWS services that comprise a data lake. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and most data lakes built on S3 services. You can identify which users and accounts made requests or took actions against AWS services that support CloudTrail, the source IP address the actions were made from, and when the actions occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudTrail can be used to simplify data lake compliance audits by automatically recording and storing activity logs for actions made within AWS accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integration with Amazon CloudWatch logs provides a convenient way to search through log data, identify out-of-compliance events, accelerate incident investigations, and expedite responses to auditor requests. CloudTrail logs are stored in a separate logs bucket within your data lake (refer to the Data lake foundation section of this document) for durability and deeper analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data lake optimization&lt;br&gt;
Optimizing a data lake environment includes minimizing operational costs. By building a data lake on S3, you only pay for the data storage and data processing services that you actually use, as you use them. You can reduce costs by optimizing how you use these services. Data asset storage is often a significant portion of the costs associated with a data lake. Fortunately, AWS has several features that can be used to optimize and reduce costs. These include: S3 Lifecycle management, S3 storage class analysis, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Storage Lens, and Amazon S3 Glacier storage class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 Lifecycle management&lt;br&gt;
Amazon S3 Lifecycle management allows you to create lifecycle rules, which can be used to automatically migrate data assets to a lower cost tier of storage—such as S3 Standard-IA storage class or Amazon S3 Glacier storage class—or let them expire when they are no longer needed. A lifecycle configuration, which consists of an XML file, comprises a set of rules with predefined actions that you want Amazon S3 to perform on data assets during their lifetime. Lifecycle configurations can perform actions based on data asset age and data asset names, but can also be combined with S3 object tagging to perform very granular management of data assets. If the access pattern for your S3 buckets is constantly changing or is evolving, you can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class for automatic cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 Storage class analysis&lt;br&gt;
One of the challenges of developing and configuring lifecycle rules for the data lake is gaining an understanding of how data assets are accessed over time. It only makes economic sense to transition data assets to a more cost-effective storage or archive tier if those objects are infrequently accessed. Otherwise, data access charges associated with these more cost-effective storage classes can negate any potential savings. Amazon S3 provides storage class analysis to help you understand how data lake data assets are used. Storage class analysis uses machine learning algorithms on collected access data to help you develop lifecycle rules that will optimize costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly tiering to lower cost storage tiers is an important capability of a data lake, particularly as its users plan for, and move to, more advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities. Data lake users will typically ingest raw data assets from many sources,and transform those assets into harmonized formats that they can use for one-time querying and on-going business intelligence querying through SQL. However, users also want to perform more advanced analytics using streaming analytics, machine learning,and artificial intelligence. These more advanced analytics capabilities consist of building data models, validating these data models with data assets, and then training and refining these models with historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping more historical data assets, particularly raw data assets, allows for better training and refinement of models. Additionally, as your organization’s analytics sophistication grows, you may want to go back and reprocess historical data to look for new insights and value. These historical data assets are infrequently accessed and consume a lot of capacity, so they are often well suited to be stored on an archival storagelayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another long-term data storage need for the data lake is to keep processed data assets and results for long-term retention for compliance and audit purposes, to be accessed by auditors when needed. Both of these use cases are well served by Amazon S3 Glacier storage class, which is an S3 storage class optimized for infrequently used cold data, and for storing write once read many (WORM) data. You can also use S3 Object Lock to adhere to regulatory compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S3 Intelligent-Tiering&lt;br&gt;
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed to optimize your storage cost by automatically moving the data within your buckets by monitoring your access patterns. S3 Intelligent-Tiers makes use of two low latency high throughout access tiers: one tier for frequently accessed data and another tier for infrequently accessed data. S3 Intelligent Tiering monitors access patterns for the data for a period of 30 months and automatically moves the data to one of the access tiers without operational overhead or performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S3 Intelligent-Tiering is recommended for data that has unpredictable access patterns regardless of object type, size and retention period such as data lakes, data analytics applications or new applications. If the data from infrequently accessed tier is accessed, the data will be moved to frequently accessed tier. Additionally, you can also configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically move data from infrequently accessed tier that has not been accessed for consecutive 90 days to archive access tier and if not accessed for consecutive 180 days to deep archive access tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also configure the last access time for archiving up to a maximum of 730 days for both Archive access tier and Deep Archive access tier. S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive access tier provides same performance as Amazon S3 Glacier storage class and S3 Intelligent Tiering Deep Archive access tier provides same performance as Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S3 Storage Lens&lt;br&gt;
As your data lake becomes more popular and you start expanding to accommodate data from multiple applications across multiple accounts and S3 buckets. It can become increasingly complicated to understand usage of the data across the organization, optimize cost and understand the security posture. S3 Storage Lens gives you the visibility into your object storage across your organization with point-in-time metrics, trend lines and actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can generate insights at organization, account, region, bucket, and prefix level. S3 aggregates your usage and metrics across all the accounts and provides an account snapshot on the S3 console (Bucket) home page. You can use the Storage Lens dashboard to visualize insights and trends, identify outliers, receive recommendations for storage cost optimization, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Storage Lens dashboard to identify your largest buckets and take necessary actions to optimize the cost since the rate charged depends on the object size, duration of storage and storage class. In case you are uploading objects using multi-part upload, there might be a case when the uploads fail or not completed. The incomplete uploads remain in your buckets and are chargeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can identify these incomplete multipart uploads using Storage Lens dashboard. Additionally, storage lens can also help identify multiple versions of the objects. Finally, you can also use Storage Lens to uncover cold buckets from your account. Cold buckets are the buckets which are not accessed for a long period of time. All these insights can be accessed from the Storage Lens dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 Glacier&lt;br&gt;
Amazon S3 Glacier is a low-cost Amazon S3 storage class that provides durable storage with security features for data archiving and backup. S3 Glacier has the same data durability (99.999999999%) and supports lifecycle management on data assets stored in S3, so that data assets can seamlessly migrate from Amazon S3 to S3 Glacier. S3 Glacier storage class is a great storage choice when low storage cost is essential, data assets are rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several minutes to several hours is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different types of data lake assets may have different retrieval needs. For example, compliance data may be infrequently accessed and be relatively small in size but needs to be made available in minutes when auditors request data, whereas historical raw data assets may be very large but can be retrieved in bulk over the course of a day when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S3 Glacier allows data lake users to specify retrieval times when the data retrieval request is created, with longer retrieval times leading to lower retrieval costs. For processed data and records that need to be securely retained, Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock allows data lake administrators to deploy and enforce compliance controls on individual S3 Glacier vaults by a lockable policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administrators can specify controls such as WORM in a Vault Lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. After locked, the policy becomes immutable and S3 Glacier will enforce the prescribed controls to help achieve your compliance objectives, and provide an audit trail for these assets using AWS CloudTrail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost and performance optimization&lt;br&gt;
You can optimize your data lake using cost and performance. Amazon S3 provides a very performant foundation for a data lake because its enormous scale provides virtually limitless throughput and extremely high transaction rates. Using S3 best practices for data asset naming ensures high levels of performance. These best practices can be found in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of optimization is to use optimal data formats when transforming raw data assets into normalized formats, in preparation for querying and analytics. These optimal data formats can compress data and reduce data capacities needed for storage, and also substantially increase query performance by common data lake built on S3 analytic services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data lake environments are designed to ingest and process many types of data, and store raw data assets for future archival and reprocessing purposes, as well as store processed and normalized data assets for active querying, analytics, and reporting. A key best practice to reduce storage and analytics processing costs, and improve analytics querying performance, is to use an optimized data format, particularly a format like Apache Parquet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parquet is a columnar compressed storage file format that is designed for querying large amounts of data, regardless of the data processing framework, data model, or programming language. Compared to common raw data log formats such as CSV, JSON, or TXT format, Parquet can reduce the required storage footprint, improve query performance significantly, and greatly reduce querying costs for AWS services, which charge by amount of data scanned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon tests comparing CSV and Parquet formats using one TB of log data stored in CSV format to Parquet format showed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space savings of 87% with Parquet (1 TB of log data stored in CSV format compressed to 130 GB with Parquet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A query time for a representative Athena query was 34x faster with Parquet (237 seconds for CSV versus 5.13 seconds for Parquet), and the amount of data scanned for that Athena query was 99% less (1.15TB scanned for CSV versus 2.69GB for Parquet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to run that Athena query was 99.7% less ($5.75 for CSV versus $0.013 for Parquet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parquet has the additional benefit of being an open data format that can be used by multiple querying and analytics tools in a data lake built on Amazon S3, particularly Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional options for performance optimization include rightsizing of the S3 objects to 128 MB, partitioning based on business dates which are typically used while querying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-proofing-the-data-lake"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Future proofing the data lake
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A data lake built on AWS can immediately solve a broad range of business analytics challenges and quickly provide value to your business. However, business needs are constantly evolving, AWS and the analytics partner ecosystem are rapidly evolving and adding new services and capabilities, as businesses and their data lake users achieve more experience and analytics sophistication over time. Therefore, it’s important that the data lake can seamlessly and non-disruptively evolve as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS future proofs your data lake with a standardized storage solution that grows with your organization by ingesting and storing all of your business’s data assets on a platform with virtually unlimited scalability and well-defined APIs, and integrates with a wide variety of data processing tools. This allows you to add new capabilities to your data lake as you need them without infrastructure limitations or barriers. Additionally, you can perform agile analytics experiments against data lake assets to quickly explore new processing methods and tools, and then scale the promising ones into production without the need to build new infrastructure, duplicate and/or migrate data, and have users migrate to a new platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 is a scalable, highly durable, and reliable service to build and manage a secure data lake at scale. You can ingest and store structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from wide variety of sources into a centralized platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a data lake built on S3, you can use native AWS services to run big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications to gain insights from your unstructured data sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also have the flexibility to use your preferred analytics, AI and ML solutions from the Amazon Partner Network (APN). S3 provides a wide variety of service features to empower IT managers, storage administrators, and data scientists to enforce access policies, manage objects at scale, audit activities and secure data across their data lake built on S3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, a data lake built on AWS allows you to evolve your business around your data assets, and to use these data assets to quickly and agilely drive more business value and competitive differentiation without limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Easily add certifications to LinkedIn from your website.</title>
      <author>Suvin Nimnaka</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 14:05:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/suvink/easily-add-certifications-to-linkedin-from-your-website-550j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/suvink/easily-add-certifications-to-linkedin-from-your-website-550j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back &lt;a class="mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/lakindu"&gt;@lakindu&lt;/a&gt; and I were building a platform for &lt;a href="https://academy.richmondlive.lk"&gt;@Richmond Live&lt;/a&gt; 's new training program. The students were given a digital certificate for the courses they completed at the Richmond Live's academy and once they log in, they can share their certificate across social media platforms or simply download the PDF certificate. In addition to that, students can maintain their public profile which can be used as a portfolio for their achievements at the academy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While building this platform, we needed a feature to have a button that will add the certification directly to LinkedIn. Checked the official LinkedIn documentation but to keep things simple, we wanted a small NPM package that can do the job. Unfortunately we couldn't find anything that is flexible and stable enough to use in out application. We ended up using the hard way; building the button from the scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days we decided to create a package ourselves for people to use easily. So &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/linkedin-certification"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Linkedin-certification&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-it-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does it do?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will let you to add your certifications directly into LinkedIn from your website. (&lt;em&gt;Not directly! You still need to confirm the details :wink&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-install"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to install?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install linkedin-certification --save
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;or else if you're a &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; user,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn add linkedin-certification
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use it?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, import the package
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LinkedinCertification&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;linkedin-certification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then use the imported component with your certification details.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;LinkedinCertification&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;certificationName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My Sample Certification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;organizationName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;My Sample Organization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;issuedMonth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;issuedYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expirationMonth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;expirationYear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;certificateId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;29c2e87e-5c1c-11ec-bf63-0242ac130002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;certificateURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;https://www.google.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newTab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thats it! You can see a button like this on your application upon saving.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/46b14f0a5c9408a8b9ad5e66166806390290bae8ef580a47cdbdcf54c565cb41/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6c336d3432614e2e706e67" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/46b14f0a5c9408a8b9ad5e66166806390290bae8ef580a47cdbdcf54c565cb41/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6c336d3432614e2e706e67" width="201" height="60"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-property-list"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The property list
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Property&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;certificationName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The name of the certification. &lt;code&gt;[Required]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;organizationName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The name of the organizaion. &lt;code&gt;[Required]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;issuedMonth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Certification issued month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;issuedYear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Certification issued year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;expirationMonth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Certification expiry month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;expirationYear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Certification expiry year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;certificateId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unique ID of the certification&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;certificateURL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;URL for the certification&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;newTab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to open the LinkedIn Certification window in a new tab&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;customButton&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;React Node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lets you pass your own custom button.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yes-you-saw-it-right"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  YES you saw it right!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;linkedin-certification&lt;/code&gt; lets you add your custom buttons instead of the default one that comes with the package! Got a really cool button with a bunch of animations? Or need a button that goes with your website theme? We got you! Use the &lt;code&gt;customButton&lt;/code&gt; property and pass down your own button component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contributions-are-welcome"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contributions are welcome!
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#help-me-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Help me more!
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like this package, please consider buying me a coffee so that I can keep improving this even further! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/suvink"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rb9xKs4G--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" width="545" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading folks! Happy coding! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Play Blur onblur</title>
      <author>Mads Stoumann</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 13:59:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/madsstoumann/play-blur-onblur-4f8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/madsstoumann/play-blur-onblur-4f8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a colleague asked me what we should do &lt;code&gt;onfocusout&lt;/code&gt; on a task, we're working on. I told him it's called &lt;code&gt;onblur&lt;/code&gt; in JavaScript (we were both right, more on this later!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this, &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; colleague said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this a reference to the band? Otherwise, it's a shitty name”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(if you're not familiar with the band &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blur_(band)"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;onblur&lt;/code&gt;-event, this probably isn't funny at all) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… maybe it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a shitty name, but what if we could &lt;strong&gt;play&lt;/strong&gt; Blur &lt;code&gt;onblur&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to add an audio-file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;audio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"woohoo.mp3"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"woohoo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/audio&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We'll give it an id, &lt;code&gt;woohoo&lt;/code&gt;, so we can easily reach it from code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we'll add a fieldset, with some inputs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;fieldset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;legend&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Play Blur onblur&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/legend&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;♪ Woohoo&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;♫ Woohoo&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;♫ Woohoo&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/fieldset&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And finally, a little snippet of JavaScript, where we iterate the &lt;code&gt;elements&lt;/code&gt;-collection of the fieldset, and add an &lt;code&gt;onblur&lt;/code&gt;-eventListener to each input:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;blur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;woohoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's it! Now focus on a field and leave it ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/stoumann/embed/ExwmqOv?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#real-usecases"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Real use-cases
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so admittedly this is just plain &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt;, but maybe we could actually use this technique in conjunction with the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation"&gt;Constraint validation API&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a form-field is &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;, it could play a tiny "ding!"-sound, and if it's &lt;strong&gt;invalid&lt;/strong&gt;, a tiny "buzz"-sound.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-focusout-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;focusout&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out my colleague was right: there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; an event called &lt;code&gt;focusout&lt;/code&gt; (and it's counter-part: &lt;code&gt;onfocusin&lt;/code&gt;) – I'm just so old-school, that I've used &lt;code&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;blur&lt;/code&gt; for ages! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;code&gt;blur&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;onfocusout&lt;/code&gt; actually &lt;em&gt;bubbles up&lt;/em&gt;, meaning we can add a single event to the fieldset instead:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;focusout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;woohoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;– but it's not funny at all to play Blur &lt;code&gt;onfocusout&lt;/code&gt;, is it? 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conslusion: Thank you to my colleagues for giving me an excuse to code something stupid &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; learning about the &lt;code&gt;onfocusout&lt;/code&gt;-event!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Secure our website  using JWT (JSON Web Token) in nodeJS or expressJS</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/deepakjaiswal/secure-our-website-using-jwt-json-web-token-in-nodejs-or-expressjs-5a7d</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#here-we-are-using-jwt-to-secure-our-application-or-website-from-unauthenticated-user-they-try-to-access-our-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  here we are using JWT to secure our application or website from unauthenticated user they try to access our data.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In npmjs a library named is &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jsonwebtoken &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm i jsonwebtoken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if we only check user isAuthenticated or not we simply pass the middleware in between request and response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#authjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  auth.js
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export default function getTokenFromUser(req: Request) {&lt;br&gt;
  const authorization = req.headers.token;&lt;br&gt;
  var decoded = jwt.verify(authorization, 'secret');&lt;br&gt;
  if (!decoded) {&lt;br&gt;
    throw new TokenError("No Authorization Header");&lt;br&gt;
  }&lt;br&gt;
  try {&lt;br&gt;
    const token = decoded?.split("User data ")[1];&lt;br&gt;
    return token;&lt;br&gt;
  } catch {&lt;br&gt;
    throw new TokenError("Invalid Token Format");&lt;br&gt;
  }&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we simple pass this auth of in between req,res&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.post('/api/post',auth,(req,res)=&amp;gt;{
//if some operation on code we use middleware
const token=jwt.sign({
  data: 'your data to store as token'
}, 'secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });

res.header('token',token).send("success")
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we ensure that you can save your secret key in your config file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to create a simple CSS only dropdown </title>
      <author>Anton</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 13:04:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/antmik/how-to-create-a-simple-css-only-dropdown-529a</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/antmik/how-to-create-a-simple-css-only-dropdown-529a</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a small CSS tutorial I decided to write this morning. Maybe later I should do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's topic gonna be CSS based dropdown menu. The code itself was written from scratch. It took me around 30 minutes. The only external code was used is CSS reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using Pug to write quick HTML and SCSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is to create a dropdown container div.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then put inside a button. It will serve as a trigger. Then we put inside an unordered list with a few items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.dropdown
 button.trigger-btn Hover me
  ul.dropdown__items
   li.dropdown__item Menu item 1
   li.dropdown__item Menu item 2
   li.dropdown__item Menu item 3
   li.dropdown__item Menu item 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we add padding, background color, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For color selection, &lt;a href="https://materialui.co/colors/"&gt;Material colors&lt;/a&gt; were used. There you can quickly choose some nice-looking colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows for the dropdown were generated with a help of a &lt;a href="https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html"&gt;CSS generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished with styles and HTML. Now, how actually does the magic works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a dropdown appear on mouse-over we need to set :hover pseudo-class. When the .dropdown container is mouse-over.dropdown__items element becomes visible by adding display:block CSS rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the code example to understand better how it works:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/AntM/embed/QWMPEgO?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
