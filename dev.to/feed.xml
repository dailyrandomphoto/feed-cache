      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this article, we show how signals generated by the use of an ad blocker can improve browser fingerprinting accuracy. This novel browser fingerprinting method, while oft-discussed as a theoretical source of entropy, has only just been added to FingerprintJS as of April 2021, and has never been fully described until now. Ad blockers are an incredibly pervasive and useful piece of technology. Around 26% of Americans use an ad blocker today. If you are reading this article on ad blocker technology, you almost undoubtedly have one installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ad blockers make the internet a more pleasant experience for many people, whether or not they protect your privacy in any meaningful way is up for debate. As ad blockers have access to the content of all pages that a browser loads and can reliably perform cross-site tracking, they are able to collect more information on a user’s browsing activity than most marketing trackers they block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more insidiously, the fact that a user is attempting to avoid being tracked online with an ad blocker can be used to identify them. Consider the example of tracking an individual in the woods by their shoe print. You may find success if you know their shoe’s size and ridge pattern, but it may be just as easy if you know that person habitually covers their tracks by raking a branch over their path. Whether you are looking for a shoe print or the absence of one, a signature pattern can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers leave a trace that can be harnessed by the websites you visit to identify you. By testing whether certain page elements are blocked, a site can find discrepancies in the filters used by your specific ad blocker(s). These discrepancies provide a source of entropy that when combined with other unique signals, can identify a specific user over multiple visits. This combining of browser signals to create a unique identifier is known as browser fingerprinting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While browser fingerprinting is a proven-out method of visitor identification (you can read more about how it works in our beginner’s guide), how ad blockers can be used for fingerprinting is rarely discussed. As the developers of the largest open source browser fingerprinting library, we have only started including ad blocker signals as of April 2021, so this work is hot off the press from our team. We hope shining a light on this cutting edge technique will be useful to the open source community at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-an-ad-blocker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is an ad blocker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ad blocker is a browser extension that prevents browsers from loading video and displaying advertisements, pop-ups, tracking pixels and other third-party scripts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wu83_u3x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nOBtmxeQ-nwYhOX1tRe0NF8mGfYdQHRnV-6G_3OXALdvGyq-fUR5DCcl-Pq_XnJsXcuzbbsYC-bmJkFQgk-JZQlp3GU0OwGGHskeDdT6dz-wgs91UCjwn40TDgaXX3msLiifBGAV" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wu83_u3x--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nOBtmxeQ-nwYhOX1tRe0NF8mGfYdQHRnV-6G_3OXALdvGyq-fUR5DCcl-Pq_XnJsXcuzbbsYC-bmJkFQgk-JZQlp3GU0OwGGHskeDdT6dz-wgs91UCjwn40TDgaXX3msLiifBGAV" alt="What is an ad blocker" title="What is an ad blocker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers not only improve the online experience by hiding ads, but also protect browsing activity from being tracked by third-party scripts. All major online ad platforms (like Google and Facebook), as well as other marketing and product testing tools (like Crazy Egg and Hotjar) use tracking scripts to monitor and monetize user activity online. Privacy conscious users often turn to ad blockers to stop their browsing history from being shared with these platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ad blockers have access to the content of all pages that a browser loads. They have a lot more information about browsing activity than trackers, because trackers can’t do reliable cross-site tracking. Therefore, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/popular-chromium-ad-blockers-caught-stealing-user-data-and-accessing-accounts/"&gt;it is possible for ad blockers to violate user privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Safari is an exception which we’ll discuss below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-ad-blockers-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How ad blockers work
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we’ll go fairly deep into the internals of ad blockers as it will help us build a better understanding of how ad blocking mechanics make it possible to reliably identify visitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers typically run as extensions built on top of browser APIs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and other Chromium-based browsers: Extensions are JavaScript applications that run in a sandboxed environment with additional browser APIs available only to browser extensions.  There are two ways ad blockers can block content. The first one is element hiding and the second one is resource blocking:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Element hiding is done either by injecting CSS code, or by using DOM APIs such as &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll"&gt;querySelectorAll&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild"&gt;removeChild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource blocking employs a different technique. Instead of rendering elements on a page and then hiding them, extensions block the resources on a browser networking level. To plug into browser networking, ad blockers will intercept requests as they happen or use declarative blocking rules defined beforehand. Request interception utilizes &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest/"&gt;webRequest&lt;/a&gt; API, which is the most privacy violating technique. It works by reading every request that a browser is making and deciding on the fly if it represents an ad and should be blocked. The declarative approach utilizes &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/"&gt;declarativeNetRequest&lt;/a&gt; API to preemptively instruct browsers what needs to be blocked. This happens without reading actual requests, thus providing more privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;: This API is almost the same as in Google Chrome. The only notable difference is the lack of &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/"&gt;declarativeNetRequest&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;: Unlike Chrome or Firefox, Safari extensions are native applications. Safari provides &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/creating_a_content_blocker"&gt;a declarative API&lt;/a&gt; for ad blockers. Ad blockers create static lists of things that describe what to block, and pass them to Safari. A list will contain rules that tell what network requests, HTML elements or cookies to block. A list content may also depend on user settings. Ad blockers have no way of accessing browsing history in Safari. You can watch &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/511/"&gt;a video by Apple with a detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android browsers are a special case, in that they generally lack extension APIs. However, Android Play Market allows you to install ad-blocking apps that will work in all browsers. These apps will create a VPN on the system level and pass all the device traffic through it. The VPN connection will act as an ad blocker by adding JavaScript code or CSS styles to pages that will hide unwanted content, or by blocking HTTP requests entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ad-blocking-filters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ad blocking filters
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blockers prevent ads from being shown by looking for specific elements to block within the site’s contents. To identify these advertising elements, ad blockers use collections of rules called "filters" to decide what to block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vyEutIeC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/w4qO5U7HQl2sBCMJE6gnuhCQLbOE0UW8I0a_cRKekJ2AK-A-YjA_csDCPFtWMb0KRILbmoHEUO2XEHcs0go6v6fgfVHUzcBMds7MFScZfot1e6B4ccaykOjf2vC4lTlZG9N6Dpzc" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vyEutIeC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/w4qO5U7HQl2sBCMJE6gnuhCQLbOE0UW8I0a_cRKekJ2AK-A-YjA_csDCPFtWMb0KRILbmoHEUO2XEHcs0go6v6fgfVHUzcBMds7MFScZfot1e6B4ccaykOjf2vC4lTlZG9N6Dpzc" alt="How ad blocker filters work" title="How ad blocker filters work"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually these filters are maintained by the open source community. Like any other project, filters are created by different people for different needs. For example, French websites often use local ad systems that are not known worldwide and are not blocked by general ad filters, so developers in France will want to create a filter to block ads on French websites. Some filter maintainers can have privacy concerns and thus create filters that block trackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A filter is usually a text file that follows a common standard called "&lt;a href="https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters"&gt;AdBlock Plus syntax&lt;/a&gt;". Each line of text contains a blocking rule, which tells an ad blocker which URLs or CSS selectors must be blocked. Each blocking rule can have additional parameters such as the domain name or the resource type. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blocking rule example is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rRwG8ajy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/54P_Mlf61BTLLYMCsYn3Sd35mrIXHTymQrXvnS09ZKA0r-CahOU2n2dwqMhVau1gkqPByS2PpGRQmylrgBe16pV6i1KRjts_fII7_OB5_UUiDq4G-DivaKdiB3Biw3vCINPWwOK9" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rRwG8ajy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/54P_Mlf61BTLLYMCsYn3Sd35mrIXHTymQrXvnS09ZKA0r-CahOU2n2dwqMhVau1gkqPByS2PpGRQmylrgBe16pV6i1KRjts_fII7_OB5_UUiDq4G-DivaKdiB3Biw3vCINPWwOK9" alt="Ad blocker blocking rule" title="Ad blocker blocking rule"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common sets of filters used by AdBlock, AdGuard and other ad blockers include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://easylist.to/"&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt;: includes &lt;a href="https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt"&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt"&gt;EasyPrivacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-cookiemonster.txt"&gt;EasyList Cookie List&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://easylist.to/easylistgermany/easylistgermany.txt"&gt;EasyList Germany&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters#adguard-filters"&gt;AdGuard&lt;/a&gt;: includes a &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_2_English/filter.txt"&gt;base filter&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_11_Mobile/filter.txt"&gt;mobile ads filter&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_3_Spyware/filter.txt"&gt;tracking protection filter&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_4_Social/filter.txt"&gt;social media filter&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.fanboy.co.nz/"&gt;Fanboy&lt;/a&gt;: includes &lt;a href="https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/enhancedstats.txt"&gt;Enhanced Trackers List&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-antifacebook.txt"&gt;Anti-Facebook Filters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-annoyance.txt"&gt;Annoyance List&lt;/a&gt; and several others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-get-entropy-from-ad-blockers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to get entropy from ad blockers
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to get as much information from ad blockers as possible to generate a fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JS script running on a page can't tell directly if the browser has an ad blocker, and if it does, what is blocked by it. Instead, the script can try adding something on the page to see if it gets blocked. The addition can be an HTML element that matches a blocked CSS selector or an external resource such as a script or an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend using CSS selectors over resources to detect ad blockers, as resource detection has two significant downsides. Firstly, detecting whether a resource is blocked requires trying to download the resource by making an HTTPS request and watching its state. This process slows down the web page by occupying the network bandwidth and CPU. Secondly, the HTTPS requests will appear in the browser developer tools, which may look suspicious to an observant site visitor. For these reasons, we will focus on using CSS selectors to collect data in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now run through how to generate two related data sources using ad blocker signals: the list of blocked CSS selectors, and the list of filters. Finding the list of filters will result in a significantly more stable fingerprint, but requires additional work to identify unique CSS selectors to distinguish each filter from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-source-1-detecting-the-list-of-blocked-css-selectors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data source 1: detecting the list of blocked CSS selectors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of detecting whether a CSS selector is blocked consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the selector, i.e. get the tag name, CSS classes, id and attributes from it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an empty HTML element that matches that selector and insert the element into the document;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for the element to be hidden by an ad blocker, if one is installed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check whether it's hidden. One way to do it is checking the element's &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetParent"&gt;offsetParent&lt;/a&gt; property (it's null when the element is hidden).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do the above steps for each selector, you'll face a &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid_layout_thrashing"&gt;performance issue&lt;/a&gt;, because there will be a lot of selectors to check. To avoid slowing down your web page, you should create all the HTML elements first and then check them to determine if they are hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach can generate false positives when there are a lot of HTML elements added to the page. It happens because some CSS selectors apply only when an element has certain siblings. Such selectors contain a general sibling combinator (~) or an adjacent sibling combinator (+). They can lead to false element hiding and therefore false blocked selector detection results. This problem can be mitigated by inserting every element into an individual &amp;lt; div&amp;gt; container so that each element has no siblings. This solution may still fail occasionally, but it reduces the false positives significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example code that checks which selectors are blocked:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A storage for the test elements&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// First create all elements that can be blocked&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectorToElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then wait for the ad blocker to hide the element&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then check which of the elements are blocked&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;offsetParent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Then remove the elements&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Creates a DOM element that matches the given selector&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectorToElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the implementation at https://bit.ly/3yg1zhX&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;.advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;img[alt="Promo"]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To determine which CSS selectors to check, you can download some of &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/f1174cf83e2ec94d0c576d4caabf9ebbcf41fccc/docs/content_blockers.md#list-of-filters"&gt;the most popular filters&lt;/a&gt; and extract the CSS selectors that are blocked on all websites. The rules for such selectors start with ##.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your chosen selectors should contain no &amp;lt; embed&amp;gt;, no fixed positioning, no pseudo classes and no combinators. The offsetParent check will not work with either &amp;lt; embed&amp;gt; or fixed positioning. Selectors with combinators require a sophisticated script for building test HTML elements, and since there are only a few selectors with combinators, it isn't worth writing such a script. Finally, you should test only unique selectors across all the filters to avoid duplicate work. You can see a script that we use to parse the unique selectors from the filters &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/f1174cf83e2ec94d0c576d4caabf9ebbcf41fccc/resources/content_blocking/make_selectors_tester.ts"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see some of the selectors blocked by your browser in the &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/ad-blocker-fingerprinting/"&gt;interactive demo&lt;/a&gt; on our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data source 2: getting the list of ad blocking filters
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better way to get identification entropy from ad blockers is detecting which filters an ad blocker uses. This is done by identifying unique CSS selectors for each filter, so that if a unique selector is blocked, you can be sure a visitor is using that filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify which selectors are blocked by each filter. This step will be done once as a preparation step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get unique selectors by filter. This step will also be done once as a preparation step. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check whether each unique selector is blocked. This step will run in the browser every time you need to identify a visitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three steps are explained in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identify-which-selectors-are-blocked-by-each-filter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identify which selectors are blocked by each filter
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the selectors blocked by a filter we can’t just read them from the filter file. This approach will not work in practice because ad blockers can hide elements differently from filter rules. So, to get a true list of CSS selectors blocked by a filter, we need to use a real ad blocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of detecting which selectors a filter really blocks is described next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an HTML page that checks every selector from the filters you want to detect. The page should use the process described in the previous section (detecting the list of blocked CSS selectors). You can use &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/f1174cf83e2ec94d0c576d4caabf9ebbcf41fccc/resources/content_blocking/make_selectors_tester.ts"&gt;a Node.js script&lt;/a&gt; that makes such an HTML page. This step will be done once as a preparation step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the ad blocker settings and enable only the filter we’re testing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the HTML page and reload it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the list of blocked selectors to a new file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat the steps for each of the filters. You will get a collection of files (one for each filter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some filters will have no selectors, we won’t be able to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-unique-selectors-by-filter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get unique selectors by filter
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you have selectors that are really blocked by each of the filters, we can narrow them down to the unique ones. A unique selector is a selector that is blocked by only one filter. We created &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/f1174cf83e2ec94d0c576d4caabf9ebbcf41fccc/resources/content_blocking/get_unique_filter_selectors.ts"&gt;a script&lt;/a&gt; that extracts unique selectors. The script output is a JSON file that contains unique blocked selectors for each of the filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some of the filters have no unique blocked selectors. They are fully included into other filters. That is, all their rules are presented in other filters, thus making these rules not unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how we handle such filters in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/f1174cf83e2ec94d0c576d4caabf9ebbcf41fccc/docs/content_blockers.md#5-handle-empty-filters"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#identify-blocked-selectors-by-filter"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Identify blocked selectors by filter
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part will run in the browser. In a perfect world we would only need to check whether a single selector from each of the filters is blocked. When a unique selector is blocked, you can be sure that the person uses the filter. Likewise, if a unique selector isn't blocked, you can be sure the person doesn't use the filter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectorsOfFilters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;easyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;[lazy-ad="leftthin_banner"]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;fanboyAnnoyances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#feedback-tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getActiveFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectorArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the snippet above&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectorArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getActiveFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectorsOfFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeFilters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, the result may sometimes be incorrect because of wrong detection of blocked selectors. It can happen for several reasons: ad blockers can update their filters, they can experience glitches, or page CSS can interfere with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to mitigate the impact of unexpected behavior, we can use fuzzy logic. For example, if more than 50% of unique selectors associated with one filter are blocked, we will assume the filter is enabled. An example code that checks which of the given filters are enabled using a fuzzy logic:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectorsOfFilters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;easyList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;[lazy-ad="leftthin_banner"]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#ad_300x250_2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;fanboyAnnoyances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#feedback-tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#taboola-below-article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getActiveFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Collect all the selectors into a plain array&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;allSelectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filterName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectorCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectorCount&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectorCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;selectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getActiveFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uniqueSelectorsOfFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeFilters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ad-blocker-fingerprinting"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ad blocker fingerprinting
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you collect enough data, you can generate a visitor fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/what-is-browser-fingerprinting/"&gt;Browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; is a technique that works by reading browser attributes and combining them together into a single identifier. This identifier is stateless and works well in normal and incognito modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of ad blockers available. For example, AdBlock, uBlock Origin, AdGuard, 1Blocker X. These ad blockers use different sets of filters by default. Also users can customize ad blocking extensions by removing default filters and adding custom filters. This diversity gives entropy that can be used to generate fingerprints and identify visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of an ad blocker customization:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PCQKc1LS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hhn5ssokaf14o28zj75z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PCQKc1LS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hhn5ssokaf14o28zj75z.png" alt="Ad blocker settings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good browser fingerprint should stay the same when a user goes from regular to incognito (private) mode of the browser. Thus, ad blockers can provide a useful source of entropy only for browsers and operating systems where ad blockers are enabled by default in incognito mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safari on MacOS, iOS, iPadOS:  browser extensions are enabled (including ad blockers) in both regular and incognito mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Browsers on Android: Ad blockers work on the system level, so they affect all browser modes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop Chrome and Firefox:&lt;br&gt;
Extensions are disabled by default in incognito mode. Users however can manually choose to keep extensions enabled in incognito mode, but few people do so. Since we cannot know if a user has an ad blocker enabled in incognito mode, it makes sense to identify visitors by their ad blockers only in Safari and on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make a fingerprint solely from the information that we’ve gotten from the visitor's ad blocker either by using the list of blocked selectors, or the list of filters from the sections above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-selectors"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Selectors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a fingerprint using selectors only, we take a list of selectors, check which of them are blocked and hash the result:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the snippet above&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getBlockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the murmurHash3 implementation at&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// https://github.com/karanlyons/murmurHash3.js&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fingerprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;murmurHash3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x86&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hash128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;blockedSelectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fingerprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This fingerprint is very sensitive but not stable. The CSS code of the page can accidentally hide a test HTML element and thus change the result. Also, as the community updates the filters quite often, every small update can add or remove a CSS selector rule, which will change the whole fingerprint. So, a fingerprint based on selectors alone can only be used for short-term identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#using-filter-lists"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Using Filter Lists
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the instability of CSS selectors alone, you can use the list of filters instead to generate a fingerprint. The list of filters that a person uses is only likely to change if they switch ad blockers, or if their installed ad blocker undergoes a significant update. To make a fingerprint, get the list of enabled filters and hash it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the snippet above&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getActiveFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(...).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeFilters&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// See the murmurHash3 implementation at&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// https://github.com/karanlyons/murmurHash3.js&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fingerprint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;murmurHash3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;x86&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hash128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;activeFilters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fingerprint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kpV5Hg30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yymq0iplbbiprp4c7cko.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kpV5Hg30--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yymq0iplbbiprp4c7cko.png" alt="Demo of filter lists"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is just an image - check out the full interactive demo on &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/ad-blocker-fingerprinting/"&gt;our site!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the filter lists themselves are updated frequently. The updates can make the fingerprint change. The fuzzy algorithm mitigates this problem, but the underlying selectors will need to be updated eventually. So, you will need to repeat the process of collecting unique selectors after some time to actualize the data and keep the fingerprinting accuracy high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#performance"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Performance
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The browser main thread is where it processes user events and paints. By default, browsers use a single thread to run all the JavaScript in the page, and to perform layout, reflows, and garbage collection. This means that long-running JavaScript can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and bad user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of checking CSS selectors runs on the main thread. The algorithm uses many DOM operations, such as &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement"&gt;createElement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetParent"&gt;offsetParent&lt;/a&gt;. These operations can run only on the main thread and can't be moved to a worker. So, it's important for the algorithm to run fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've measured the time it takes several old devices to check different numbers of CSS selectors per filter. We test only in the browsers where it makes sense to identify visitors by ad blockers. The tests were conducted in cold browsers on a complex page (about 500 KB of uncompressed CSS code). The results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;MacBook Pro 2015 (Core i7), macOS 11, Safari 14&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;iPhone SE1, iOS 13, Safari 13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Pixel 2, Android 9, Chrome 89&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 selector per filter (45 in total)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.1ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.7ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At most 5 selectors per filter (210 in total)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;27ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;At most 10 selectors per filter (401 in total&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;All selectors (23029 in total)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;≈7000ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;≈19000ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;≈2600ms&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more CSS selectors the algorithm checks, the more accurate the result will be. But a large number of CSS selectors increases the execution time and the code size. We have chosen to check 5 selectors per filter as a good balance between performance, stability and the code size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a complete implementation of the described algorithm in &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/f1174cf83e2ec94d0c576d4caabf9ebbcf41fccc/src/sources/dom_blockers.ts"&gt;our GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#brave-and-tor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Brave and Tor
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brave is a browser based on Chromium. It disables extensions in incognito mode by default. Thus, we don't perform ad blocker fingerprinting in Brave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop Tor has no separate incognito mode, so every extension works in all Tor tabs. Ad blockers can be used to identify Tor users. But the Tor authors &lt;a href="https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-14/"&gt;strongly recommend&lt;/a&gt; not to install any custom extensions, and it's not easy to do so. Very few people will install ad blockers in Tor. So the effectiveness of ad blocker fingerprinting is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Closing thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ad-blocker-fingerprinting-is-only-a-small-part-of-the-larger-identification-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ad blocker fingerprinting is only a small part of the larger identification process
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blocker fingerprinting is one of the many signals our &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs"&gt;open source library&lt;/a&gt; uses to generate a browser fingerprint. However, we do not blindly incorporate every signal available in the browser. Instead we analyze the stability and uniqueness of each signal separately to determine their impact on fingerprint accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad blocker detection is a new signal and we’re still evaluating its properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about stability, uniqueness and accuracy in our &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/what-is-browser-fingerprinting/"&gt;beginner’s guide to browser fingerprinting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#try-browser-fingerprinting-for-yourself"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Try Browser Fingerprinting for Yourself
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browser fingerprinting is a useful method of visitor identification for a variety of anti-fraud applications. It is particularly useful to identify malicious visitors attempting to circumvent tracking by clearing cookies, browsing in incognito mode or using a VPN. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try implementing browser fingerprinting yourself with our &lt;a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs"&gt;open source library&lt;/a&gt;. FingerprintJS is the most popular browser fingerprinting library available, with over 14K GitHub stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For higher identification accuracy, we also developed the &lt;a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/"&gt;FingerprintJS Pro API&lt;/a&gt;, which uses machine learning to combine browser fingerprinting with additional identification techniques. You can use FingerprintJS Pro for free with up to 20k API calls per month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>[JavaScript] 5 Interesting uses of JavaScript destructuring!</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/yumatsushima07/javascript-5-interesting-uses-of-javascript-destructuring-1nnb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at my regular JavaScript code, I see that destructuring assignments are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading object properties and accessing array items are frequent operations. The destructuring assignments make these operations so much easier and concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will describe 5 interesting uses of destructuring in JavaScript, beyond the basic usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-swap-variables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1) Swap variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual way to swap 2 variables requires an additional temporary variable. Let’s see a simple scenario:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;temp&lt;/code&gt; is a temporary variable that holds the value of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Then &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is assigned with the value of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and consequently &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is assigned with &lt;code&gt;temp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destructuring assignment makes the variables swapping simple, without any need of a temporary variable:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[a, b] = [b, a]&lt;/code&gt; is a destructuring assignment. On the right side, an array is created &lt;code&gt;[b, a]&lt;/code&gt;, that is &lt;code&gt;[2, 1]&lt;/code&gt;. The first item of this array &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and the second item &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you still create a temporary array, swapping variables using destructuring assignment is more concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the limit. You can swap more than 2 variables at the same time. Let’s try that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can swap as many variables as you want! Although, swapping 2 variables is the most common scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-access-array-item"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2) Access array item
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have an array of items that potentially can be empty. You want to access the first, second, or nth item of the array, but if the item does not exist, get a default value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally you would use the length property of the array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'white'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, array destructuring helps you achieve the same way shorter:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstColor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstColor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'white'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const [firstColor = 'white'] = colors&lt;/code&gt; destructuring assigns to &lt;code&gt;firstColor&lt;/code&gt; variable the first element of the &lt;code&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; array. If the array doesn’t have any element at the index &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;'white'&lt;/code&gt; default value is assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the comma on the left side of the destructuring: it means that the first element is ignored. &lt;code&gt;secondColor&lt;/code&gt; is assigned with the element at index &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;colors&lt;/code&gt; array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-immutable-operations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3) Immutable operations
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started using React, and later Redux, I was forced to write code that respects immutability. While having some difficulties at the start, later I saw its benefits: it’s easier to deal with unidirectional data flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immutability forbids mutating objects. Fortunately, destructuring helps you achieve some operations in an immutable manner easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destructuring in combination with &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; rest operator removes elements from the beginning of an array:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fooNumbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; [2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The destructuring &lt;code&gt;[, ...fooNumbers] = numbers&lt;/code&gt; creates a new array &lt;code&gt;fooNumbers&lt;/code&gt; that contains the items from &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; but the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; array is not mutated, keeping the operation immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same immutable manner you can delete properties from objects. Let’s try to delete &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; property from the object &lt;code&gt;big&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="na"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; { bar: 'value Bar' }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;big&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; { foo: 'value Foo', bar: 'value Bar' }&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The destructuring assignment in combination with object rest operator creates a new object small with all properties from &lt;code&gt;big&lt;/code&gt;, only without &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-destructuring-iterables"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4) Destructuring iterables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous sections, the destructuring was applied to arrays. But you can destructure any object that implements the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol"&gt;iterable protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many native primitive types and objects are iterable: arrays, strings, typed arrays, sets, and maps.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cheese&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstChar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstChar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'c'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You’re not limited to native types. Destructuring logic can be customized by implementing the iterable protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies&lt;/code&gt; holds a list of movie objects. When destructuring &lt;code&gt;movies&lt;/code&gt;, it would be great to get the movie title as a string. Let’s implement a custom iterator:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;movies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Skyfall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Interstellar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstMovieTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;movies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstMovieTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'Skyfall'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies&lt;/code&gt; object implements the iterable protocol by defining the &lt;code&gt;Symbol.iterator&lt;/code&gt; method. The iterator iterates over the titles of movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conforming to an iterable protocol allows the destructuring of &lt;code&gt;movies&lt;/code&gt; object into titles, specifically by reading the title of the first movie: &lt;code&gt;const [firstMovieTitle] = movies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sky is the limit when using destructuring with iterators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-destructuring-dynamic-properties"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5) Destructuring dynamic properties
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the destructuring of an object by properties happens more often than arrays destructuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destructuring of an object looks pretty simple:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;movie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Skyfall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;movie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'Skyfall'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const { title } = movie&lt;/code&gt; creates a variable &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and assigns to it the value of property &lt;code&gt;movie.title&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When first reading about objects destructuring, I was a bit surprised that you don’t have to know the property name statically. You can destructure an object with a dynamic property name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how dynamic destructuring works, let’s write a greeting function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nameProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nameProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Unknown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Hello, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;!`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ben&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'Hello, Ben!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// =&amp;gt; 'Hello, Unknown!'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;greet()&lt;/code&gt; function is called with 2 arguments: the object and the property name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside &lt;code&gt;greet()&lt;/code&gt;, the destructuring assignment &lt;code&gt;const { [nameProp]: name = 'Unknown' } = obj&lt;/code&gt; reads the dynamic property name using square brackets &lt;code&gt;[nameProp]&lt;/code&gt;. The name variable receives the dynamic property value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better you can specify a default value &lt;code&gt;'Unknown'&lt;/code&gt; in case if the property does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destructuring works great if you want to access object properties and array items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the basic usage, array destructuring is convinient to swap variables, access array items, perform some immutable operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript offers even greater possibilities because you can define custom destructuring logic using iterators.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;
About Myself&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Yuma-Tsushima (frequently shortened to Yuma). I am an ambitious coder, and I enjoy coding in JavaScript (mainly). I also love making websites using HTML, CSS and (of course) JS! I started programming (self taught) at the age of 13. Originally, I came from the creative field ; I draw/sing/animate/make music.  &lt;/p&gt;
   

&lt;h3&gt;
Talents and Hobbies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love drawing (I have been drawing all of my life). I play strategy games, I code and I do CTFs! I am also good at animation, making AMVs and image editing. My favourite game is Mindustry, followed by Flow Free and Sudoku. I love watching anime (I love Code Geass - I relate to Lelouch a lot) and I aspire to create my own anime!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding Prettier to a Project</title>
      <author>Sia Karamalegos</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 20:28:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/thegreengreek/adding-prettier-to-a-project-13f6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/thegreengreek/adding-prettier-to-a-project-13f6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While working at a smaller dev shop, our team hit the point at which the inconsistent code formats between and within projects was becoming a pain. Our needs included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consistent linter/formatter for all projects in a particular language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An autoformatter so developers didn't spend time "fixing" linter errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tool readily available in tools like VS Code which could apply changes on save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to go with &lt;a href="https://prettier.io/"&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt;. We also added a pre-commit hook to ensure that all code changes complied with the new authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially published this as a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/siakaramalegos/4a5cdab1f44ffb217a48d5260043f8ae"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; to help when setting up new projects at that company. Today, it was useful for a client I was working with, so I'm sharing it now in an article in case the same use case fits for you, and you'd like a handy reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-steps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these steps can be found in the &lt;a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; and through other links in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A key step here is to run Prettier on all the files in a separate commit. You don't want to pollute all your future pull request diffs with formatting changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Install prettier:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm &lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-exact&lt;/span&gt; prettier
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(2) Create an empty config file to let tools know you're using Prettier:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{}&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; .prettierrc.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(3) Create a &lt;code&gt;.prettierignore&lt;/code&gt; file to let tools know which files NOT to format. &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; are ignored by default. Some suggestions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;build
coverage
.package-lock.json
&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.min.&lt;span class="k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(4) Manually run Prettier to re-format all the files in the project:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npx prettier &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(5) Set up your code editor to auto-format on save for ease of use. See &lt;a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for various editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) Set up commit hooks with &lt;a href="https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick"&gt;pretty-quick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky"&gt;husky&lt;/a&gt;. First, install them as dev dependencies:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--save-dev&lt;/span&gt; pretty-quick husky
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(7) Finally, add the pre-commit instructions to your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"husky"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"hooks"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;"pre-commit"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"pretty-quick --staged"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now when you commit your changes, files in the commit will automatically be formatted!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create a Slideshow With React</title>
      <author>AnxinYang</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 20:08:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/anxinyang/create-a-slideshow-with-react-1pb1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/anxinyang/create-a-slideshow-with-react-1pb1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's create a simple slideshow component today. It's easy and only take few steps to achieve.&lt;br&gt;
Here is a demo and source code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/ffmuk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create a slideshow, we need to have two components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The container that holds contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The individual slide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#container"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Container
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a slideshow, we need a container that can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contain all slides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hide slides that outside viewport of the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sent a signal that tells slides to move in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sent a signal that tells slides to move out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;track which slide should be shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's create a basic container with style:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Slideshow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, let's add a context that will track activated slide and a timer:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SlideshowContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Slideshow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Move deactivated slide out when edge is false&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Move activated slide in when edge is true&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;clearTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SlideshowContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Provider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;600px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="na"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/SlideshowContext.Provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that's all for the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#slide"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Slide
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slide will have at least three stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on stage - slide is in viewport and has highest z-index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;off stage - slide is in viewport and has lowest z-index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ready for stage - slide is moved out from viewport, and it's waiting at ready position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we don't move out the slide at "off stage", is because, for this slideshow, we want to move "off" slide after the "on" slide completely cover the "off" one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slide will update it's stage when received signal from the container, so it will like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slide at ready position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when signal come and the slide is activated, moved to viewport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when signal come and the current slide is not the activated one, lower the z-index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when next signal come, move to ready position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we can have something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;SlideshowItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Generate a name for this slide.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;SlideshowContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setStage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// register self with the name.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Remove the name when slide is removed.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now, we have a simple Slideshow.&lt;br&gt;
Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use Kool to Dockerize Your Local Development Environment the Right Way</title>
      <author>Fabrício José Souza</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/kooldev/use-kool-to-dockerize-your-local-development-environment-the-right-way-18gl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Docker containers in local development environments has become commonplace for web development. And yet, when you get down to it, using Docker locally is still a challenge, oftentimes resulting in a frustrating developer experience and plenty of headaches. So, what is &lt;strong&gt;the right way&lt;/strong&gt; to use containers for local development? We believe the answer is a new open source project called &lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps you develop cloud native applications in a better and more efficient way by removing barriers and allowing developers and DevOps engineers to focus on what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-realworld-learning-curve"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Real-World Learning Curve
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, Docker has taken the software development world by storm. Its powerful interface for building, deploying and running containers has led to its widespread adoption by teams and companies of all sizes. By containerizing your web applications, you can more easily work across different tech stacks, switch between different applications and microservices, and standardize and scale your environments. You no longer waste precious time debugging and fixing issues with version mismatches, concurrently running applications, dependency conflicts, poor resource control, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Docker has a straightforward "getting started" experience, developing real-world applications on containers is a lot easier said than done. You quickly start climbing a steep learning curve when your requirements evolve and you're forced to master Docker's nuances, its more advanced configurations, and the working internals of its containers in order to apply its features to more complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, mastering when to use the &lt;code&gt;-t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-T&lt;/code&gt; flags for &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker exec&lt;/code&gt;, resolving issues with permissions on mapped volumes, and even deeper issues like having your Docker network suddenly lose external packages because it has a different MTU value than the underlying host network. If you've faced these issues before, I feel for you. If not, count yourself lucky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Docker provides teams with a lot of power, this power does not come cheap. As you climb the Docker learning curve, you often have no choice but to use trial and error to find acceptable solutions to problems you encounter along the way. Since Docker expertise can vary greatly across the team, it is common to find knowledge siloed with senior members of the team, and developers applying different solutions to the same problem. Additional hidden costs include senior engineers pulled away from their work to help others with technical issues, time spent reconciling conflicting opinions and workarounds, and the frustration of disrupted workflows causing low morale. Consequently, it becomes difficult for your project to sustain its high velocity, and stay on schedule and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-better-way-with-kool"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A Better Way with Kool
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool"&gt;kool-dev/kool&lt;/a&gt;) offers a better way to use Docker locally. Kool provides a suite of open source tools that deliver a better developer experience (DX) and help you avoid the pitfalls described earlier by making sure you follow best practices and use Docker in a standardized way across your projects and teams. From local development environments running on Docker to staging and production environments running in the cloud on Kubernetes, Kool makes it easier to containerize your web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kool-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kool CLI
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;kool&lt;/code&gt; CLI provides a simple, intuitive interface for managing Docker and Docker Compose containers. It simplifies the way you use Docker in your local environment by removing the Docker "speed bumps" that slow you down, greatly reducing the learning curve and error-prone area, and helping teams leverage containers at a lower cost of entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kool CLI comes with a &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/getting-started/installation"&gt;single-line installer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/commands/kool-self-update"&gt;&lt;code&gt;self-update&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt; to easily upgrade to new releases, an intuitive command interface with a complete &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/commands/kool"&gt;command reference&lt;/a&gt;, and solid &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/introduction"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. By using the &lt;code&gt;kool&lt;/code&gt; CLI instead of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; directly, you can stop learning new flags each day and stay focused on writing code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kool-presets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kool Presets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kool Presets provide pre-built development environments with sane defaults out of the box for quickly setting up projects using popular frameworks and tech stacks, such as Laravel, Symfony, Node.js, AdonisJs, Next.js (and more). Presets auto-generate a customized &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, as well as a &lt;code&gt;kool.yml&lt;/code&gt; configuration file in which you can easily store common single-line and multi-line scripts that you execute using the &lt;code&gt;kool run&lt;/code&gt; command. This helps keep your development workflow open and shared across the entire team. &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/getting-started/how-it-works"&gt;Learn more about how it works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kool-docker-images"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kool Docker Images
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start developing in containers, you suddenly realize official Docker images are built for deployment, and are not well-suited for the special nuances of local development. One of the most common and recurring problems we see are permission issues with mapped volumes, due to host users being different from container users. Kool fixes this problem, and many others, by creating custom Docker images optimized for local development environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP Images (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-php"&gt;https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-php&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx Images (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-nginx"&gt;https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-nginx&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node Images (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-node"&gt;https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-node&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Images (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-java"&gt;https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-java&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps Images (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-toolkit"&gt;https://github.com/kool-dev/docker-toolkit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of the optimizations included in Kool Docker images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UID mapping to host user to solve permission issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alpine base images to remain small and up-to-date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configured with sane defaults (for development as well as production)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment variables to easily update the most common settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battle-tested - we've been using these images in production for quite a long time now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know what you're doing, you can use &lt;code&gt;kool&lt;/code&gt; with any Docker image. You are not required to use Kool-optimized images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#kool-cloud-coming-soon"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Kool Cloud (Coming Soon)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kool CLI integrates seamlessly with Kool Cloud. Based on the same Docker configuration you already use locally, you can very easily and quickly create staging environments in the cloud, straight from your local environment. Using a set of &lt;code&gt;kool deploy&lt;/code&gt; commands, you can push your local project repository to the Kool Cloud, where it's automatically deployed on containers running on a shared Kubernetes infrastructure. Your local environment and cloud environments have never been so close to each other!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kool Cloud is currently being tested in a closed alpha, but will soon be opened as a public beta. If you would like early access, &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/register"&gt;please create a free account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#flexible-and-extensible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Flexible and Extensible
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know your way around Docker, you can use Kool and remain totally in charge of your Docker configuration. Kool guarantees no vendor lock-in and no loss of control, which means you can fully customize and extend your more specialized Docker environments. You'll never feel as if your hands are tied. On the contrary, using Kool will actually free your hands, and let you focus on more valuable work instead of spending time tweaking your development environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#open-source"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Open Source
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kool is &lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and totally free to use. Feel free to &lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt;, help us with testing, and/or &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/slack"&gt;suggest new ways&lt;/a&gt; to make Kool better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like what we're doing, show your support for this new open source project by &lt;a href="https://github.com/kool-dev/kool"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;starring us on GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#battletested"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Battle-Tested
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kool is sponsored and maintained by &lt;a href="https://fireworkweb.com"&gt;Firework Web&lt;/a&gt;, a software development agency located in Brazil. Over many years, having worked on hundreds of web projects with dozens of teams, Firework developed a ton of expertise using Docker and other development tools, and figured out the right way to set up and manage local Docker environments. Based on this experience, the Kool project was born. And now Firework is ready to share it with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#give-it-a-try"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Give It a Try
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kool is a great new development tool that will help you use Docker containers in your local environment the right way. You'll get all the benefits of containerizing your web apps, without the hassles. If you haven't already, &lt;a href="https://kool.dev/docs/getting-started/starting-new-project"&gt;give Kool a try&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
About &lt;code&gt;kool&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool&lt;/strong&gt; is a CLI tool that brings the complexities of modern software development environments down to earth - making these environments lightweight, fast and reproducible. It reduces the complexity and learning curve of &lt;em&gt;Docker&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/em&gt; for local environments, and offers a simplified interface for using &lt;em&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/em&gt; to deploy staging and production environments to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool&lt;/strong&gt; gets your local development environment up and running easily and quickly, so you have more time to build a great application. When the time is right, you can then use Kool Cloud to deploy and share your work with the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kool&lt;/strong&gt; is suitable for solo developers and teams of all sizes. It provides a hassle-free way to handle the Docker basics and immediately start using containers for development, while simultaneously guaranteeing no loss of control over more specialized Docker environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toptal, as my first remote working place (plus interview experience)</title>
      <author>Bao Ho</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/hgb123/toptal-as-my-first-remote-working-place-plus-interview-experience-18jg</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#i-preface"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  I. Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-toptal"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Toptal?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toptal is an exclusive network of top freelance software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a challenging interview process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-background"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My background
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a software developer, have spent most of my time working with JavaScript ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a non-native English speaker. All I could do with my English skill is to read documents, send messages. I was shy and not confident when speaking English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#motivation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Motivation
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenge self's limitations and pursue to be a software developer who could work globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ii-preparation-and-interview-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  II. Preparation and Interview process
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A goal without a plan is just a wish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-round-1-english-communication"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Round 1: English Communication
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick 10 to 15-minute introductory call with a talent specialist. This round will mostly test your English communication skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This round would be easier for native English speakers or people in countries that use English as one of the main languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-acknowledgment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a non-native English speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not confident in my communication skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already have basic grammar and vocabulary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do some tweaks on mindset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole purpose is to be able to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not an English competition, neither an IELTS/TOEIC/.. exam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of it as a normal conversation with a foreign friend, the goal is to make him/her understand what I mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat English as a tool of international communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practicing plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare resources (courses, books, 3 items at most) before plan kick-off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15-day plan, 30 minutes to 1 hour each day, half on course, half on practicing speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On practicing speaking, some suggest that we should do it publicly, but I prefer to do that privately in my room with the webcam on because I would laugh at myself when I failed to pronounce any tricky words. I found joy in those moments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyrics of my favorite songs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3dy6H9b"&gt;Practice Makes Perfect: English Grammar (book).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3qIHsGG"&gt;Practice Makes Perfect: English Conversation by Jean Yates (book).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/speak-english-professionally"&gt;Speak English Professionally: In Person, Online &amp;amp; On the Phone by Georgia Institute of Technology (Coursera course).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happened"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happened?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewer was friendly. She introduced the company and asked me to introduce myself, my working experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to speak at a medium speed. For some words, I could not pronounce them correctly, but I made sure that she would know what those words were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two times she could not hear me clearly and asked me to repeat what I had just said. Overall, the conversation went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the call, she sent me an email about the next round. I asked her to delay that round to 2 weeks after, so I could prepare more carefully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-round-2-online-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Round 2: Online Coding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 90 to 120-minute online test, there are 3 to 4 coding questions on the test, one thing to keep in mind - it is algorithmic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding platform would be &lt;a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/"&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do some tweaks on mindset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on Correctness (naive) solution first, then Performance solution later (for challenges that require optimal solution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't be fantasy about the term "algorithm", think of it as a tool to solve problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I could be able to implement the naive solution and saw that it needs enhancement to perform better, then applying the algorithm would make more sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practicing plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15-day plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-3 problems, after 30-min reading supplement material (book, articles), every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For solving a problem, if I didn't come up with a solution in under 15 minutes, I would look for an answer and implement it. Understanding rather than memorizing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit"&gt;Easy problems on The HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup local environment for practicing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use JavaScript as my main programming language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a dedicated folder, create file &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;code&gt;nodemon&lt;/code&gt; globally.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -g nodemon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch the file, so I would not have to run node index.js every time I made changes. This saved me time to focus on solving challenges.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nodemon index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happened"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happened?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to certain non-disclosure agreements, I can't disclose the exact details of the programming challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read through all the problem statements, focused on the easy ones first. I wrote code on my IDE and just used Codility to submit the solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed the test with a total score of 82%, then received an email from Toptal and scheduled the next round 2 days after (I reserved one day for cooling down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-round-3-live-coding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Round 3: Live Coding
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An hour video call done with one of Toptal's senior developers. you will set up your IDE in my preferred language, will share your screen, and will be solving live coding tasks assigned by the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(similar to Round 2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happened"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happened?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems were easier than the previous round, but the challenging part here was to handle a higher pressure - live coding under observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly focused, imagined that I was still writing code with myself only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished the first task quite fast and moved to the second one. The second one was trickier. I spent half of the given time limit to come up with a solution. Still being on high after finishing the first task fast, I made the mistake of wasting my time on a clean solution, then failed to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of the time limit passed, I turned out to be panic but still manage to get rid of the previously failed solution and start writing a messy solution, but I know it would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time was over while I was still on 90% of the implementation. The screener then gave me two extra minutes to finish. Luckily, the solution finally worked. To me, this round was the hardest. It tested concentration, speed, accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to the final round. I asked the screener to reschedule it to one week later, as I had a national holiday at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-round-4-test-project-and-review"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Round 4: Test Project and Review
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#overview"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Overview
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be assigned a test project, and Toptal will give you two weeks as a deadline. You could freely choose your preferred language and framework. Once you finish, you will schedule a time with the senior developer to go over what you built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#preparation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Preparation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous working experience and self-learning effort took the most part in this round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break down requirements into smaller tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the back-end, document API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the front-end, list the screens, user's flows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approach: make it work, make it right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD would be overkill for this, I chose BDD instead (because testing is a bonus, so I prioritized it lower).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happened"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happened?
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screener from the previous round gave me a project based on my choice - web application project, full-stack development - which meant I had to cover both front-end and back-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was free to use any technology. I chose React for the front-end; NodeJS, ExpressJS, and PostgresSQL for the back-end. I had 2 weeks to finish it and kept in mind to treat it as a project that I would deliver to a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the final round, so I was in high concentration. I tried to make progress each day and finished basic features after one week. After, I still use one week left to enhance the flow, handle boundary cases, write some tests, refactor codebase, and sweat for details on the front-end. I submitted the project on the final day and scheduled a review session 2 days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the review (demo) session day, the atmosphere was comfortable. I and the screener had small talks to get to know each other. He was calm and friendly. The session began, I started demonstrating my project on my local machine. The screener demands some small changes, asked me several constructive questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demo went well, and he congratulated me with "Welcome to Toptal".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iii-experience-in-the-network"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  III. Experience in the network
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After joining Toptal, the first thing I had to do was completing my profile. Toptal helped me with this. When my profile was reviewed and activated, I could see the dashboard and start applying for jobs of any technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community as well as the Toptal core team members were extremely friendly and helpful. They were always ready to help whenever I needed. I was satisfied and gained more confidence thanks to their effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iv-round-n-continued-excellence"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IV. Round N: Continued Excellence
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't take talent to practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still maintain the habit of everyday practicing. I'm not gifted, so I have to gift myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to Toptal is tough, but it's worth the try. If you are hunting freelancing opportunities or first remote working experience, or only want to challenge yourself, give Toptal a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use my &lt;a href="https://topt.al/2WczNb"&gt;referral link&lt;/a&gt; to apply. If you join, we'll both earn a $2,500 bonus once you're hired on your first job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi awesome community, Andou here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://github.com/andou/tech-resources"&gt;https://github.com/andou/tech-resources&lt;/a&gt; you can find my curated list of useful tech resources for web developers and tech enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've a strong backend background, so my list is somewhat lack of frontend references and links, as you can see :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please, check out the list, give it a star if you like it and do not hesitate to contribute with a PR. Any help, frontend-wise expecially, would be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jenkins - Getting Started</title>
      <author>Manish R Warang</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 19:23:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/g33kzone/jenkins-getting-started-43cd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/g33kzone/jenkins-getting-started-43cd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jenkins.io/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;  is an open-source automation server written in Java. It supports the entire software delivery lifecycle, including build, document, test, package, stage, deployment, static code analysis, and deployments via plugins. Several tools (e.g. unit tests, report generation, SCM, etc.) can be integrated with Jenkins via plugins. Jenkins has been the most widely adopted tool for CI/CD, thanks to its energetic, active community. This Jenkins community offers more than  &lt;a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/"&gt;1800+ plugins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins project was started in 2004 (originally called Hudson) by  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohsuke_Kawaguchi"&gt;Kohsuke Kawaguchi&lt;/a&gt;. Initially created for Continous Integration (CI), today Jenkins is capable to orchestrate the entire software delivery pipeline – called Continuous Delivery (CD) and even further to provide Continuous Deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a diagrammatic representation of the Jenkins pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r9avZQYC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624257504548/I57qV2b2C.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--r9avZQYC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624257504548/I57qV2b2C.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-06-21 at 12.05.24 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many scenarios, a single Jenkins server isn't sufficient to cater to the needs of multiple code-commits triggering zillions of pipelines. In such scenarios, distributed Jenkins architecture (Master Controller - Agents) can be leveraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lIuosdl2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624270752573/KWy4PcFFk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lIuosdl2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624270752573/KWy4PcFFk.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-06-21 at 3.45.47 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Awesome Github Readme</title>
      <author>C-mmon</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 18:51:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/cmmon/my-awesome-github-readme-20d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/cmmon/my-awesome-github-readme-20d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/C-mmon"&gt;https://github.com/C-mmon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally took inspiration from many github readme and created one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are few things I kept in mind while making it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullet points: Using Bullet Point increases Readability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not rating myself: I have seen github profile where they have rated themselves A+, B or such. But honestly, its the client or some other person who provide feedback and rating. So take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making it dynamic: Many Developer fail to update their readme and seriously you should not, if you are a productive person.&lt;br&gt;
Hence, I decided to use Github action to generate Github statistics and fetch latest tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For github statistics: I would recommend to use the one provided by Jacob Strieb.&lt;br&gt;
As stated by him, "When someone views a profile on GitHub, it is often because they are curious about a user's open source projects and contributions. Unfortunately, that user's stars, forks, and pinned repositories do not necessarily reflect the contributions they make to private repositories"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, I created spotify app to allow readers to know what I am listening too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are all links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github Stats:&lt;a href="https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats"&gt;https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fetching the latest tweets: &lt;a href="https://github.com/gazf/github-readme-twitter"&gt;https://github.com/gazf/github-readme-twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For fetching Medium Articles: &lt;a href="https://github.com/omidnikrah/github-readme-medium"&gt;https://github.com/omidnikrah/github-readme-medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contribution Graph: &lt;a href="https://ashutosh00710.github.io/github-readme-activity-graph/"&gt;https://ashutosh00710.github.io/github-readme-activity-graph/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify: &lt;a href="https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem"&gt;https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typing SVG: &lt;a href="https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com"&gt;https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is GraphQL? </title>
      <author>Shruti Kapoor</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 18:22:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shrutikapoor08/what-is-graphql-hj5</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shrutikapoor08/what-is-graphql-hj5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, it's like when you go to a pizza place, and order a "Make your own" pizza - you pick the base, the sauce, the cheese, the toppings and when the pizza is done, you get exactly what you asked for. With REST, its like you pick a pizza from the predefined menu items. You may get the toppings you want, but you may also get other toppings (like tomatoes) you didn't ask for and sometimes, we will just have to manually pick the tomatoes out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In technical terms, a GraphQL is a query language - a syntax for querying for data from any data source - be it an API or database. GraphQL is an alternative to REST APIs and provides a new way of asking for data. GraphQL lets you specify what data fields you need, and delivers exactly those fields. GraphQL &lt;a href="https://spec.graphql.org/"&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; defines the set of rules for implementing a GraphQL API. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important point to note is that GraphQL isn't a query language for your database. Unlike SQL, you don't have a query such as &lt;code&gt;SELECT * from users&lt;/code&gt; for your database. Instead, GraphQL syntax defines how to ask for data from your API. the syntax of a GraphQL query looks like this -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight graphql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getUsers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;firstname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, the &lt;code&gt;QL&lt;/code&gt; in GraphQL means a query language for your API, not database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool thing to note is that GraphQL can be used with any data source such as REST APIs &amp;amp; database. It can be plugged anywhere, built in any language and can be fit on top of any database and tech stack, which means that you can use GraphQL on top of REST APIs and still get the benefits of GraphQL without having to tear down existing REST based architecture. You can use GraphQL in a Java app, JavaScript app, Python, Django, NextJS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL fits on both client and server side layers. You build a GraphQL API on the server side and then consume this GraphQL API on the client side by firing GraphQL requests (queries, mutations, etc.). There are tools such as &lt;a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; that provide full stack solutions to help build GraphQL API on the server and consume it on the client side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rest-vs-graphql-example-making-an-api-request"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  REST vs GraphQL example: Making an API request
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that we want to fetch a user's name. In a REST API, we have an endpoint that we can use to make a GET request. The endpoint may look like &lt;code&gt;/users/{id}/&lt;/code&gt;. If we use a curl request to make a call and pass in &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of a user, it will look like this -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Content-Type: application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.example.com/api/users/123`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's look at how GraphQL request will look - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "GET" operation of REST is done by &lt;a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/"&gt;"Query"&lt;/a&gt; in GraphQL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have a separate endpoint for &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; in GraphQL. Every request is sent to &lt;code&gt;/graphql&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to describe what data we are interested in, we pass the relevant parameters to "Query" operation and describe which Query we are interested in. A GraphQL API may support something like "getUsers" Query, which is a query we can use to get users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A curl request to a GraphQL API looks like -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Content-Type: application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;{ "query": "{ user(id:123 ) { name } } " }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.example.com/graphql&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rest-vs-graphql-implementing-the-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  REST vs GraphQL: Implementing the API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In REST world, we will have resource implementations for each of our operations, such as &lt;code&gt;GET /user/{id}&lt;/code&gt; is mapped to &lt;code&gt;getUser(String id)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;getUser&lt;/code&gt; defines what data is passed if this endpoint is called. This resource implementation will also call any downstream operation if need be - other APIs or fetch directly from the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GraphQL, when implementing a GraphQL API, we need to first the define the schema of the API. Schema is a complete description of what queries, mutations and parameters are allowed. A "GET" operation is done by "Query" in GraphQL. We can specify what arguments a query accepts in a Schema&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;type Query {
    getUser(id: $String!)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What we return from this &lt;code&gt;getUser&lt;/code&gt; query is defined by a function called resolvers. Resolvers define what data should be returned when a field is called. Every query is mapped to a resolver. A resolver function can call any API or data sources. Our resolver can be written like this -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getUser(args){
    const { id } = args;
    //fetch from database / API 
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;when a client fetches &lt;code&gt;getUser&lt;/code&gt; query, they will get back data like this -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "data" : {
        "name": "Sample name"
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#graphql-terminology"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GraphQL terminology
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query: Query is similar to GET in REST. When we want to fetch information from a GraphQL API, we use Query. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutation: A mutation is used when we want to mutate the data on the server. A mutation is similar to PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH in a REST API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schema: Schema is a complete representation of what operations a GraphQL API supports. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Major differences between REST and GraphQL
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;REST&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;GraphQL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REST has multiple endpoints.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GraphQL has one endpoint - /graphql&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REST APIs support PUT, GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GraphQL supports Query, Mutation, Subscription&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;REST endpoints are populated by resource implementations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GraphQL fields are populated by resolvers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200 , 400 , 500 level status codes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200 level status codes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Often times, roundtrips need to be done in order to fetch complete data&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;You can fetch multiple fields therefore fetch all the data you need with one requestt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shape of the data is determined by the server&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shape of the data is determined by the client calling the API.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  When to use GraphQL vs REST
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use GraphQL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have multiple downstream APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have extraneous data coming from downstream APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you care about which fields are being used by which clients. With the help of GraphQL, you can have field level instrumentation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you care about ensuring that all clients have the most up to date version of your API. With GraphQL, since there is one endpoint, all updates are given to everyone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you want to build a UI-first API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you care about underfetching and overfetching. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;When to use REST *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you depend heavily on caching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you don't know a complete set of fields you may get from downstream APIs. With GraphQL, you need to know the schema upfront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you rely heavily on status codes of downstream APIs. Everything in GraphQL is a 200, so you will need to parse the response object or errors object. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TL;DR
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain words, GraphQL is a syntax for asking for data. The big difference between REST and GraphQL is that there is one endpoint only - &lt;code&gt;graphql&lt;/code&gt;, and in addition to making the call to the API endpoint and passing desired parameters, we also need to provide exactly what fields we want to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In technical terms, GraphQL is a specification and provides a way for querying for data. The specification specifies what should happen when data is requested and mutated. GraphQL specifies a way to ask for data, and delivers exactly the data that was requested. Since it is a specification, GraphQL APIs can be created in language - JavaScript, Java, Go, Python. &lt;/p&gt;
