  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework you choose to use is crucial in the development's success. AngularJS and ReactJS remain the most popular frameworks for developing React js with Java Point or JavaScript. You can utilize both of these frameworks to build mobile and web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should investigate the &lt;a href="https://www.techavidus.com/blogs/angular-vs-react?utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_devto=devto&amp;amp;utm_campaign=content_sharing"&gt;differences between AngularJS and ReactJS&lt;/a&gt; to figure out which is the most ideal decision for your requirements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-exactly-is-react-js"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What exactly is React JS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React is a JavaScript library that was developed by Facebook that lets you build component components for your user interface. To offer a flexible and efficient solution for users, the React JavaScript framework employs server-side rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-exact-meaning-of-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the exact meaning of Angular?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular can be utilized to build dynamic web applications. The developers must employ HTML as an example language in addition to HTML syntax to define the components of the application in a concise manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular is a fully-featured JavaScript framework that assists in the creation of single-page, dynamic web-based applications. It also helps to create the structure of programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-benefits-of-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Benefits Of React
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One most important benefit of react js are that it doesn't have a long learning curve. Why is react is superior to the angular? To grasp another important benefit to using it. Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) and how it works is essential. It is the Document Object Model (DOM) is a model that defines the layout of a website page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-benefits-of-angular"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Benefits of Angular
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a comprehensive Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework powered and maintained by Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits that come with React over the benefits of Angular If you ask about the advantages of AngularJS Most developers will refer to its implementation of the MVC pattern as the primary benefit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should you use angular to react in the face of other frameworks that require that you divide your app into MVC components? By forcing you to create your own MVC pipeline to connect the parts, Angular manages the components for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-disadvantages-of-both"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The disadvantages of both:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One drawback that comes with ReactJS is that it's an application that is a library instead of a fully-fledged framework such as AngularJS. It is likely that you'll require different libraries to handle certain aspects of your application. Additionally, certain developers are not satisfied by ReactJS's documentation. ReactJS documentation Angularjs technology offers a series of powerful benefits for your mobile or web application but also has corner limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep learning curve for the framework is the biggest drawback, However, the challenge of learning the framework has been exaggerated a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Linking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data binding is the process that synchronizes data from the business technology and the interface for users is referred to as data binding. Angular 2 is different from React Js in that it utilizes both one-way and two-way data binding. Changes in the data impact the view while changing the view can cause changes to the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React utilizes one-way binding this means that when designing a React application, developers often create child components inside more-ordered parent elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another binding method enhances the stability of code and makes it easier to debug within a React instead of an Angular application. The one-way binding of Angular, in contrast, is what allows the framework to be more flexible and simpler to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOM and Performance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, each of React Along Angular is a fantastic front end. They are also excellent for large-scale application development. Let's say you want to change the user's name within their personal profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every developer must be able to update their architecture to include new libraries and modules. For starters, you have to install updates from versions one at a time. React can be described as a program that has full backward compatibility.&lt;br&gt;
You can also add new versions of the libraries into the application, as well as update older ones. If you plan to build your project slowly with new capabilities, React may be the most suitable choice due to its total backward compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#which-one-is-more-fun-to-work-with-angular-or-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Which one is more fun to Work With, Angular or React?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can You Have Fun Working with Angular?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Angular is an excellent documentation tool and a multitude of built-in functions, allowing users to build complicated applications without the need for third-party applications.   However, it has a steeper learning curve which results in a longer ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are familiar with traditional statically typed OOP languages like C++, C#, or Java might be able to work in Angular since TypeScript has a syntax similar to these languages.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it feel enjoyable to work with React?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that React expects you to gain proficiency with various outsider programming packages to build a multifaceted application, and the documentation is substantially less yet it's of good quality and has numerous models.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-reason-we-use-react"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is the reason we use React?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For debugging isolated issues, we can make use of ReactJs, which allows developers to achieve stability for their apps. Moreover, the components-determined design of React allows us to reuse components, which saves the hour of developers and furthermore cash while creating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're currently working on an app for the web that can aid car owners with scheduling maintenance. It also tracks the number of visits to the car which makes the process of purchasing and selling a vehicle completely safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to develop an application that is progressive to provide this service for mobile-based users. In terms of single-page websites like this, each of AngularJS and ReactJS can be great alternatives. But, they're completely different tools. There is a possibility to the effect that React is superior over Angular or reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AngularJS and ReactJS have their differences, ReactJS developers and AngularJS developers are able to agree on one perspective: when you have some knowledge of both of them, you'll have the option to develop top-quality applications utilizing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you use react with angular Js, the framework you select will heavily be determined by the needs of your project, as well as individual preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReactJS is a good choice for developers with less experience, simply due to its simplicity However, AngularJS development provides a complete solution for front-end development, which can benefit big-scale projects. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life Lessons : The Fourth Passenger</title>
      <author>AJALA MAYOWA FELIX</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 08:20:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/amfstacks/life-lessons-the-fourth-passenger-4in8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/amfstacks/life-lessons-the-fourth-passenger-4in8</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have dropped the pen for a while but looking at the stacks of UN-shared life lessons and write ups !&lt;br&gt;
I have to share this and lighten the vessel .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; is borne out of a whole lot of personal and virtual experiences, I really hope y'all able to get the message !&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I boarded an "along" vehicle ,&lt;br&gt;
Four passengers are to be at the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, I am very sure the back seat was originally designed to accommodate 3 passengers , but you know, prices of things have gone up!, even the drivers need to make ends meet and NURTW does not apparently care about the welfare of passengers&lt;br&gt;
(if at all they ever did).&lt;br&gt;
So they stuff the back seats with 4 passengers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, on this particular day,&lt;br&gt;
I was the third passenger,&lt;br&gt;
It was barely convenient for us even before &lt;strong&gt;the fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; joined us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver drove on with the hope of getting &lt;strong&gt;the fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not contain the thought of a &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; joining us, it would be worse !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to pay for the &lt;strong&gt;fourth&lt;/strong&gt; (vacant) seat but I kept this plan to myself and stayed mute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping mute is not so nice but cunningly smart …..&lt;br&gt;
You can't blame me too,&lt;br&gt;
We are all saving cost ! 😂.&lt;br&gt;
No one knew my intention of paying for the fourth seat, &lt;br&gt;
We kept moving !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the exact plan…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was actually waiting ….. to see if the driver would be able to make &lt;strong&gt;efforts&lt;/strong&gt; to find a &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; to shove to the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, that would determine my next line of action .&lt;br&gt;
If he happens to find a &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt;, then,&lt;br&gt;
I will reveal my intention of paying for the extra (fourth) seat 💺 ….. 😞!&lt;br&gt;
And If he does not find any, I will just "throway face" and continue to enjoy the "free-spaced" ride.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, …..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly how lot of things are in life !&lt;br&gt;
I have seen several life scenarios based exactly on this model!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lotta people are waiting to see&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; "if you would make it"&lt;br&gt;
"If you could do it"&lt;br&gt;
"If you could achieve it"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proffering their (long) "&lt;strong&gt;due&lt;/strong&gt;" responsibilities, duties, and help ….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen it played out a lot in life,&lt;br&gt;
Lot of people would only step in to help you, do the right thing they needed to have done, only when they discovered you have been able to pull through without their actions and or in-actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are denied their due benefits 'cause they were thought undeserving, or they have not made enough efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are waiting to see if you are "worth" it, or whether you deserved it according to their own criteria before giving it to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I was concerned ,&lt;br&gt;
The driver &lt;strong&gt;did not worth&lt;/strong&gt; getting paid for a passenger he has not found until he actually got one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot of people won't help you until you have made a positively resulted efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why your rich uncle or friend might not help you with your educational pursuit until you study hard and you graduate!&lt;br&gt;
You know, that's a point when you can actually do without their involvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why your company won't promote you at the due time until you work so much on yourself till they see other companies bidding for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relationships,&lt;br&gt;
A lot of people don't value or rate their partners until their partners are valued by someone more than them!&lt;br&gt;
It's not like people really want to step in and assist you, they will only be forced to do so when they know you have grown to a level you can do without their so called assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologically, some people find it easier to help those that don't actually need the help, than the actual needy ones !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baseline message is&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;em&gt;TRY,&lt;br&gt;
make EFFORTS ,&lt;br&gt;
Help yourself ,&lt;br&gt;
Build yourself *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Try your best on your own without necessarily depending on a virtual or promised help anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot of people would proffer lot of helps, advices , assistances when you are already up there, when you technically don't really need their assistance and you will just wonder where were all these before you got here !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can keep on with so many examples and (not personal) experiences ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a newbie on some stuffs , &lt;br&gt;
I really needed some one to just put me through but my supposed helper (maybe sincerely)was too busy! &lt;br&gt;
But he came back looking for me to help me when he knew I have been able to get them fixed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a setup from a friend,&lt;br&gt;
He didn't give me, by the time he learnt I have made research and found an alternative and sure source of getting the same setup !&lt;br&gt;
He proffered the same aid I earlier requested!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company I worked with delayed my promotion but swept to action when they got the news of a bigger company fixing a virtual appointment meeting with me .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot !&lt;br&gt;
Some scenarios are just too ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't make (right) efforts to put your self up, No body will rate you !&lt;br&gt;
Make (right) efforts !&lt;br&gt;
Make efforts to get your &lt;strong&gt;fourth passenger&lt;/strong&gt; and you would be surprised at how many were &lt;strong&gt;willing&lt;/strong&gt; to pay for the fourth seat!&lt;br&gt;
The fourth passenger ~ amfstacks&lt;br&gt;
✍️🙏🏽&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/danielj46612790/nft-marketplace-development-know-its-features-functionality-beg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An NFT marketplace allows NFT enthusiasts to buy and sell digital assets upon uploading their digital collectibles in the marketplace. As the craze for NFTs went high in recent years, many business people and entrepreneurs are showing interest in plunging into the NFT industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you one of the ambitious ones? Forge ahead with NFT marketplace development services. Beforehand, know how the NFT marketplace works with the integration of typical features in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-does-an-nft-marketplace-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How Does An NFT Marketplace Work?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are the simple steps that briefly explain how the NFT marketplace works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irrespective of the buyer or seller, the foremost step they have to take is to sign up with the platform by specifying the required information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial setup, a verification process has to be followed, which includes KYC. Once done with the verification, the crypto wallet will be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Henceforth, the users will be able to mint their works and their NFTs will be listed in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buyers who have interest in your NFT works would place their bids when works come for auction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the seller is self-satisfied with the bids, the auction will be closed and transactions made. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From now, the buyer will have ownership of the NFT works and these will be saved in their wallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#salient-features-to-consider-during-nft-marketplace-development"&gt;

Here are a few benefits of deep learning in healthcare that you might know: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning in healthcare can be a learning tool collecting data and recording information about patients, their symptoms, and treatments. Doctors or professionals in the medical field can use this information as a future preference for the patients’ treatments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning in healthcare allows you to create a model based on data sources available when you require a risk score on administration. Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/"&gt;healthcare software development firms&lt;/a&gt; apply deep learning techniques in healthcare to provide accurate and timely risk scores. That boosts confidence and appropriately allocates the resources. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using deep learning in healthcare, people can reduce costs and get improved outcomes. For example, &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/electronic-health-records-software-ehr"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; (EHR) and &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/blog/medicine-apps-as-a-patients-assistant-for-medication-intake/"&gt;digital healthcare applications&lt;/a&gt; can make data more accessible to trained algorithms than ever. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to deep learning in healthcare, health staff give more accurate and faster diagnostics during patient treatments. Doctors can identify patterns by connecting custom healthcare software.  For instance, deep learning in healthcare can determine whether the skin lesions are cancerous or not like any certificated dermatologists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#top-applications-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Top applications of deep learning in healthcare
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#computer-vision-one-of-the-largest-successes-of-deep-learning-in-healthcare"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Computer vision: One of the largest successes of deep learning in healthcare
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer vision emphasizes images and videos and handles tasks such as object classification, segmentation, and detection. This deep learning technique is useful in determining whether patients’ radiograph contains malignant tumors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical imaging, for example, can benefit from advances in object classification and image detection. Many studies have proved the results in complicated diagnostics spanning dermatology, radiology, and pathology. Furthermore, deep learning in healthcare could support physicians by giving second opinions and providing concerning areas in images. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the models of deep learning in healthcare have obtained physician-level accuracy at a variety of diagnostic tasks. Thanks to the custom healthcare software, people can identify moles from melanomas, diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular risk, and spinal analysis with magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#natural-language-processing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Natural language processing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural language processing is one of the top applications of deep learning in healthcare. This application of deep learning in the medical field focuses on analyzing text and speech to infer meaning from words. When developing custom healthcare software, software engineers use deep learning algorithms to process inputs such as language, speech, and time-series data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant successes of natural language processing include machine translation, image captioning, and text creation. In terms of the healthcare industry, sequential deep learning and healthcare languages benefit &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/electronic-health-records-software-ehr"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; (EHR). For example, a hospital typically generates about 150,000 pieces of data. With such a huge amount of data, the applications of deep learning in healthcare can solve many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reinforcement-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reinforcement learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most successful applications of deep learning in healthcare, reinforcement learning is a technique to train computational agents. This reinforcement learning can happen through trial and error, demonstration, or a hybrid method. &lt;a href="https://adamosoft.com/health-care-software-development"&gt;Healthcare software development firms&lt;/a&gt; use reinforcement learning in which health fields accomplish better goals through learning expert demonstration. People can learn to predict the expert’s actions through imitation or by inferring the experts’ objectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another healthcare domain that can benefit from deep reinforcement learning is robotic-assisted surgery (RAS). Deep learning can promote the robustness of RAS by using computer vision models to adapt to surgical environments and learn from physical motions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generalized-deep-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generalized deep learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond computer vision, natural language processing, etc, generalized deep learning is adaptable to healthcare domains where data requires customized processes. More specifically, modern genomic technologies collect various measurements of proteins in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, deep learning in healthcare can use these data to analyze these measures, so it helps to provide more accurate treatments and diagnosis. Moreover, deep learning can further boost additional modalities such as medical images, and wearable device data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#future-of-deep-learning-a-ray-of-hope-for-medical-and-health-fields"&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/opkey/overcoming-the-challenges-of-salesforce-testing-with-ai-driven-test-automation-3ne9</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The future of Salesforce will be bright and enthusiastic, it will continue to grow and reach new heights. First of all, Salesforce CRM is the market leader in the CRM domain and generates huge revenue. As business dependencies are increasing on Salesforce, testing of the ERP becomes the prime concern. Salesforce Testing is a critical element of Salesforce administration and implementation. All Salesforce specialists must apply testing methodologies to their areas of expertise. In this blog, we are going to emphasize the challenges of Salesforce testing and how a predictive test automation tool Opkey with the power of AI overcomes all your challenges.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The automated testing of Salesforce is challenging as most web pages are dynamic in nature on the Salesforce platform. Therefore, Salesforce demands that automation testers create a strong automation framework to sustain in the future. In the search for the best automation tool to automate Salesforce testing, many choose Selenium as their go-to tool. If you’re also considering using Selenium to test Salesforce, read on to ensure you make an informed decision and learn about the challenges that await you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, the Selenium toolset offers a number of possibilities for Salesforce test automation. Selenium is a popular software testing tool that is open-source and supports most browsers and operating systems. It is perhaps best known for allowing testers to automate in any preferred programming language. The problem is, not all testers know how to program. Because of this, testers can end up spending a lot of time setting up and maintaining automation flows. So the question is: Is Selenium worth the time investment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Selenium has many benefits, it also lacks a number of features to make it the ultimate Salesforce test automation tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Selenium only allows you to test web apps, not mobile or desktop apps. So, end to end test automation across all enterprise ecosystems becomes a big challenge for enterprises using Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful features like reporting and data-driven testing are only possible with the integration of additional tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test scripts that are created with Selenium, require a significant maintenance effort to keep the scripts up to date with regular changes coming with every Salesforce update.&lt;br&gt;
Selenium-based scripts don’t understand the impact of change after any update nor perform any risk-based analysis.&lt;br&gt;
In other words, Selenium is by no means an “all-in-one” platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at some technical testing challenges with Selenium scripting, particularly to Salesforce test automation, and how a codeless automation tool Opkey relieves many headaches for software testing teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handling Dynamic Elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic elements are more common in ERPs such as Salesforce and SAP. These elements change locator with each page load. Oftentimes, this is the ID that changes, as it is dynamically generated with each page load. Consequently, the test may fail where a dynamic element is present, creating many false positives when initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey offers its intelligent AI-powered recorder, which can use self-healing technology to update location strategies when dynamic elements change locators. Best of all, Opkey’s test builder is updated with a more robust localization strategy, so your test will run smoothly on subsequent runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation through windows/tabs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s common in today’s complex application landscape to have tests across multiple browser tabs or even windows. Oftentimes, you may also need to interact with multiple sites, validating that information flowed from one system to another. Maintaining browser state and user data across multiple tabs or windows can be a monumental task. Especially when it comes to recording and playback solutions, they are often confined to a single browser tab, making it impossible to properly capture these complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey automated engine navigates through multiple tabs and windows while maintaining test status and transferring test data. Even Opkey’s smart recorder can keep pace with these scenarios, letting you take advantage of both recording and playback approaches, even in the most difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iFrames&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An iFrame is basically a web page within another web page. They are commonly used in more complex packaged applications such as Salesforce and SAP. Additionally, they are a popular way to embed third-party content (like advertisements) into a web page. Working with iFrames with Selenium is not an easy task. You need to create sound logic using code to select the right frame to interact with. Otherwise, Selenium will fail to find your locator because it is not looking for the right place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey’s Smart Test Builder can manage iFrames with ease. Just click on your test case normally as any user would, and Opkey’s smart test automation will handle all of the frame switching and complex logic creation for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opkey is uniquely qualified to automate dynamic Salesforce applications with its predictive autonomous testing platform. Key features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-code Test builder–&lt;/strong&gt; Opkey’s zero-code test builder can easily handle dynamic objects and specific controls provide 70% faster test creation as compared to Selenium. The test builder is also updated continuously to be in sync with the latest Salesforce updates freeing you from all maintenance worries. &lt;br&gt;
Salesforce API testing– Opkey’s automation engine generates tests automatically for all your REST and SOAP services. It can automatically detect API endpoints for your salesforce org, ensuring 70% faster API test creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model-Based Testing approach–&lt;/strong&gt; With Opkey’s model-based testing approach you can easily create a model of your application with drag and drop canvas. Provides 50+ Pre-Built Salesforce model for the most comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.opkey.com/salesforce/"&gt;Salesforce test automation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
End to end impact analysis– Based on risk-based testing, Opkey’s foresight solution gives you information on the scope of Salesforce testing after each update. The impact analysis feature identifies what exactly will break, and automatically updates your test scripts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and try the &lt;a href="https://www.opkey.com/"&gt;Opkey test automation platform&lt;/a&gt; for all your Salesforce testing worries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/kiranmantha/how-they-made-controls-at-github-1h18</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you observe the cover image of this article?? if yes, then that's the answer to this article's title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes github makes use of &lt;code&gt;details and summary&lt;/code&gt; html5 tags to create controls like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode1: Dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode2: Modals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can treat this as television series but don't afraid this won't go forever like ever 😌. we got very few episodes that u can count using single hand 👏 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in Episode1 let's see how they created a dropdown using details and summary tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's create a basic details and summary structure:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a dropdown&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;if observed above snippet we're using &lt;code&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; attribute to define the usecase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the above snippet got rendered we just see an accordion with empty content. But a dropdown contains a list of options right let's add them&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;details&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;role=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a dropdown&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 2&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'3'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 3&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'4'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'radio'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'dropdown'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'4'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Option 4&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;great this will render an accordion with a list of 4 options with radio buttons. whenever you select an option, the previous selection is cleared because we make use of name attibute on radio button list. now let's style this as a dropdown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$padder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$trigger-border-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ccc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$option-hover-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#eee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$chevron-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#3273dc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$checkmark-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='%23FFF' stroke-width='4' stroke-linecap='round' stroke-linejoin='round'%3E%3Cpolyline points='20 6 9 17 4 12'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E")&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$chevron-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='24' height='24' viewBox='0 0 24 24' fill='none' stroke='rgba(65, 84, 98, 0.999)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-width='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-linecap='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;' stroke-linejoin='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%3E%3Cpolyline points='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'%3E%3C/polyline%3E%3C/svg%3E");&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;details[role='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dropdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'] {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  position: relative;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  &amp;amp;.disabled {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    cursor: not-allowed;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp; &amp;gt; summary {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      pointer-events: none;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 0.3);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  &amp;amp; &amp;gt; summary {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    list-style: none;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    position: relative;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    cursor: pointer;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    padding: $padder;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    line-height: 1;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    color: inherit;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    border: 1px solid $trigger-border-color;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    border-radius: 2px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      display: none;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp;::after {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      content: '';&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      margin-top: -2px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      margin-left: 10px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  &amp;amp;[open] &amp;gt; summary {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    border-bottom-left-radius: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    border-bottom-right-radius: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    &amp;amp;::after {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      transform: rotate(180deg);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  summary + ul {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    position: absolute;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    top: auto;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    left: 0px;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    z-index: 100;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    list-style: none;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    li {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      box-sizing: border-box;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      padding: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      color: inherit;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      input[type='&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;radio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'] {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        position: absolute;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        opacity: 0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        &amp;amp;:checked + label {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          border-left-color: $chevron-color;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      label {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        cursor: pointer;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        color: inherit;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        display: block;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        position: relative;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        padding: $padder;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        border-left: 3px solid transparent;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        white-space: nowrap;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        &amp;amp;:hover {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;          background-color: $option-hover-color;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;        }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;      }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;    }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;excellent. we made an awesome dropdown. But there's an issue here. If you open the dropdown, whenever you click outside the dropdown should close which is not happening right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate solution which come across your mind is adding an event listener to window to close drodown. right?? But what if i say we don't have to use javascript to close the dropdown. Then what's the solution?? css. Yes we can leverage css to close dropdown when we click outside. lets's see how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the above scss snippet, add &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; pseudo selector to &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;[open] &amp;gt; summary {...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::before&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's it. we didn't use a single line of javascript code to create this dropdown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can add checkboxes to convert this to multi-select dropdown. in &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; snippet, convert radio buttons to checkboxes. but we need to add extra css to style the new layout. this is complete css for our dropdown:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;  }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Awesome 😍 we created a dropdown out of html and css. But..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to maually close the dropdown when we are using this dropdown for single select. Whenever an option is selected, then remove &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; attribute on details tag using &lt;code&gt;detailsTag.removeAttribute('open')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update the &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt; tag text when an option is selected or comma seperated options in case of multi-select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Github make use of details and summary tag for dropdown and that's the end of this episode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the working example &lt;a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-vz6n19?file=index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#endtitles"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  EndTitles
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know there is a very small css library(~10kb) which helps us in getting freedom from the clutches of remembering &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; number of helper classes just to design your layout?? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if not then, welcome to &lt;a href="https://picocss.com/"&gt;PicoCSS&lt;/a&gt;. Just write semantic html for your layout and leave the rest to PicoCSS. It comes with built-in responsive layouts and light/dark modes. I raised a &lt;a href="https://github.com/picocss/pico/pull/86"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; for above dropdown implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not mentioning this library because i raised a PR but i love how the contributors make leverage of html5 and css to create awesome layouts. Go ahead and check their docs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile bring out your thoughts on how we can change the position of dropdown if it is out of viewport and post your solutions in comments section below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in next episode. Thanks..&lt;br&gt;
Kiran 👋&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Bye console.log,no console.log in 2022</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/imshivanshpatel/good-bye-consolelogno-consolelog-in-2022-1foc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;yes you heard it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we frequently use &lt;strong&gt;console.log()&lt;/strong&gt; to check our outputs in console, it's ok in Development mode but it is highly disgraced in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so then what's the solution for it.so in production we basically use production grade loggers.This article is going to teach you how to use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.Why ps-logger ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
=&amp;gt;yes you have &lt;strong&gt;few&lt;/strong&gt; other options but the problem is that you have to do lots of manual configurations in it.That's why beginners don't even touch production grade loggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-logger"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a plug and play logger.There is no manual configurations.you have to just install and use it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i ps-logger
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example:-
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ps-logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;warn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;verbose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is verbose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;silly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;This is silly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Mastering on flex-basis behaviour</title>
      <author>⚡Preethi</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/preethi_dev/mastering-on-flex-basis-behaviour-56a2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Gang, Feel lucky to see you again. when start to learning on flexbox, feel like the least well-explained property in Flexbox tutorials. start to getting confused😥 like what exactly &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behavior?? what's the difference between &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;?? etc.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, increase our frustartion rate right. After reading lots of blog and did some exprimentation. Finally grasped the answer for all question🎉🎉. Then I'm get ready to make you mastering on &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour and let's get this show on the road. So, Be feel like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6cOaC_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gxj5yoe0n9lrjytcffv0.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a6cOaC_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gxj5yoe0n9lrjytcffv0.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="460"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before understanding of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;. Need to aware of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Main axis&lt;/b&gt; of flexbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex items formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Main axis of flexbox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: row&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: row-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run left to right or right to left of the page in the inline direction (horizontally).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--j86F582n--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5h5wywuoo7cb5xntqasu.png" alt="Image description" width="522" height="152"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex-direction: column-reverse&lt;/code&gt;, your &lt;code&gt;main-axis&lt;/code&gt; will run top to bottom or bottom to top of the page in the block direction (vertically).
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PyWG99nM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x9liam9aifn9hf5jt977.png" alt="Image description" width="709" height="227"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flex item formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex item(which means elements inside the flex container) following specific formula,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vQPLtTDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vuvya31pioueoctmf15b.png" alt="Image description" width="520" height="143"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which conveys that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If no &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the item's &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;br&gt;
If no &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; is specified, then the &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; falls back to the computed width of the item's contents&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default value of &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; take an element’s size across the main axis. which means,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 250px, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 250px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you get my point😍. If can't, don't worry. You can understood through below example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--acEfPqjj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i51kmnwotu59f2nefv81.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 if &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;b&gt;row&lt;/b&gt; and flex-basis is 160px, then main axis is in inline direction(horizontally) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;. If we change the flex direction to &lt;b&gt;column&lt;/b&gt;, then main axis is in block direction(vertically) and it take 160px in &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; thus alternately determines width or height, depending on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Seems like &lt;b&gt;dynamic&lt;/b&gt; in nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to practice in codpen like just swtich the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt; and see the effect lively..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/preethi-dev/embed/bGoLOqe?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Still with me🥳. I can understood, You are getting very curious about &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; behaviour. So, It's my pleasure to show you &lt;b&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4 key behaviours of flex-basis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; controls either “&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;” based on the &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will override any other &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; properties if specifically declared anything other than &lt;code&gt;flex-basis: auto;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; will still obey &lt;code&gt;min-width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; or height settings, which is based on &lt;code&gt;flex-direction&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;b&gt;auto&lt;/b&gt;, it first checks for a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; property (based on direction) if none, it uses the elements content sizing.(just remember that flex-item formula &lt;b&gt;content &amp;lt;- width &amp;lt;- flex-basis&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; is: the size of flex items before they are placed into a flex container(which means before the flex-shrink or flex-grow getting applied). &lt;b&gt;It's the ideal or hypothetical size of the items&lt;/b&gt;. After placing the flex item in flex container, things may getting changed based on flex container size. Because flex container won't have enough space(&lt;code&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/code&gt; start to shrinking the items), or will have extra space(&lt;code&gt;flex-grow&lt;/code&gt; start to growing the items).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uh😅, &lt;code&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt; guy have so much of behaviour and Congratulations,You reached the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nVRbKW5M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h9dbaimtu10jph7n1455.gif" alt="Image description" width="498" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please execuse me, I will end up with a bonus info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;A best practice is to just use flex-basis instead of width or height&lt;/b&gt;. Especially since Safari still has an old flexbox bug where it won't apply flex-shrink properly to items that use height instead of flex-basis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If i continue now, which make you feel overwhelmed😥. &lt;b&gt;So, If you feel need live example for key behaviours of flex-basis and just drop a comment &lt;/b&gt;which make a way to know about your thought and I will start to build part-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you loved this blog, Then give an endearing heart💝and drop your thought about this blog😍 which really a lot to me. I love the discussion with you, If you feel not comfortable at styling concepts or have any doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Reading!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preethi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Make your CSS life easier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm mixing up this week's win thread in honor of the upcoming new year (for those cultures that recognize the New Year as beginning this upcoming Saturday, that is). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking back on our weeks, what would you say your biggest win was for this past YEAR? What are you proud of having accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All wins count — big or "small" 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of 2021 'wins' include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a new job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to value your personal strengths &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking more time off to unplug with loved ones regularly ... or whatever else might have sparked joy and purpose ❤️ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your accomplishments in 2021! You're amazing 🌠 &lt;/p&gt;
