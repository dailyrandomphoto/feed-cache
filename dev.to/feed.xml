      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Jamstack and ecommerce are a lot like chocolate and avocado. At first, they don't sound like they'll go together, but they actually work really well; once you try it and realize the potential, you'll find that there's a whole community of people ready to share their amazing recipes on how to make them taste great together. In the same way, the Jamstack can sometimes appear incompatible with ecommerce, but it doesn't have to be! Here are our top ten favorite tools to help you start selling on your Jamstack site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#takeshape"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://takeshape.io/"&gt;TakeShape&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TakeShape&lt;/strong&gt;'s API Mesh enables front-end developers to harness the power of the Jamstack by stitching together multiple external APIs with an intuitive internal CMS. I've actually been working on a series of livestreams about hydrating a product page with content from the TakeShape CMS and pricing data from Stripe, and while that might seem complex, TakeShape handles it smoothly. I just have to make one GraphQL request, and exactly the data I need arrives at the client, regardless of where that data originally came from. I wrote a summary article about those streams so you can see the process; you can &lt;a href="https://www.takeshape.io/articles/using-api-mesh-to-streamline-ecommerce-development-a-stream-summary/"&gt;check it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a little biased towards TakeShape, so I'll skip the ratings for this one, but I honestly love it; I'm including it in almost every project nowadays and think it's awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stripe"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://stripe.com/"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point of ecommerce is to make money, so you need a tool to collect payment information and actually charge your customers. &lt;strong&gt;Stripe&lt;/strong&gt; is the gold standard here. It's super simple to use, especially with the kits and libraries they provide, like &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout"&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js"&gt;Elements&lt;/a&gt;. Their documentation is best-in-class, and their developer support team is the most helpful I've ever had to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more complicated setups can start getting difficult to manage, as Stripe locks you to using their system of products, subscriptions, prices, and customers, but that system is more than adequate for the vast majority of use cases. You do have to use something on the server-side for this, since Stripe requires that you keep one of your API keys secret for obvious reasons. On the Jamstack, that means running it on a host that supports serverless functions or funneling the requests to Stripe through an API Mesh like &lt;a href="http://takeshape.io/"&gt;TakeShape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I give Stripe a 9.5/10 based on its incredible developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#snipcart"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://snipcart.com/"&gt;Snipcart&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snipcart&lt;/strong&gt;'s tagline is Add a shopping cart to any website. It sure is bold, but they live up to that claim: devs from big names like &lt;a href="https://www.fiverr.com/"&gt;Fiverr&lt;/a&gt; to small ecom sites are turning to Snipcart to make selling on the Internet easier. Using just HTML and JavaScript, you can inject a cart onto your site, define some attributes to describe whatever you're selling, and hook up your "Add To Cart" button. &lt;a href="https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/installation"&gt;It's really that simple.&lt;/a&gt; DX is definitely important, but if the product manager still needs a little more convincing, you can tell them that it's portable (it's not stuck to any specific stack) and will speed up your development by working with your existing site. A lot of the tools in this market require you to build the site to work with the tool, but Snipcart has no such requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snipcart is flexible enough to handle almost any use case well, but there are some situations where you might be better off reaching for a more low-level tool. For example, I was looking into building a marketplace, and the guys from Snipcart told me that having money moving from a buyer to a seller would be difficult to implement without the money first going through a single account, which opens you up to higher transaction fees and getting taxed on those transactions differently depending on your jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snipcart isn't the magic solution to every ecommerce need, but it absolutely nails its intended functionality, so I can confidently give this a 10/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#memberful"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/"&gt;Memberful&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecommerce is more than just paying for a product online; one of the core concepts in ecom is the membership subscription. &lt;strong&gt;Memberful&lt;/strong&gt; aims to simplify and abstract away the difficulty of this often tricky payment model, and man, does it succeed. Take a look at &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/help/how-to/create-a-plan/"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; for an example of its simplicity. It's definitely designed with non-developers in mind, so this will be a perfect fit for you if you're trying to paywall content on a larger site with dedicated content managers, if you're working on a site without a backend (like a Jamstack site), or with a Wordpress site (they've got an excellent and well-maintained plugin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I like about Memberful is that they're honest about their tool not being for everyone. &lt;a href="https://memberful.com/alternatives/"&gt;In their own words&lt;/a&gt;, "we'd rather recommend a competitor that’s a better fit for your business than try to hard sell you on Memberful." They go on to list some situations where Memberful might be a little tougher to use and then they offer some better alternatives. For example, Memberful works best on digital content, so if you're selling physical products via an online experience (like &lt;a href="https://www.butcherbox.com/"&gt;Butcher Box&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/"&gt;Dollar Shave Club&lt;/a&gt;), you might be better off with an all-in-one solution like &lt;a href="https://squareup.com/us/en"&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's less flexible than other solutions, but Memberful takes the master-of-one over the jack-of-all-trades approach, so they make up for it by perfecting their core feature set. They've definitely earned my approval: 9/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#auth0"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://auth0.com/"&gt;Auth0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication is really hard to get right, and no matter how many times I try to roll it myself, I always fail. But then I heard about &lt;strong&gt;Auth0&lt;/strong&gt;, and I believe I physically sighed in relief. They just give you a login system with best practices built right in, something I was really bad at building previously. Their security experts have already worked out &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-retailers-can-prevent-ecommerce-fraud-this-holiday-season/"&gt;solutions to fraud and other problems&lt;/a&gt; that modern ecommerce platforms are bound to face at some point or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Auth0 can be difficult to get started with. It takes a bit of knowledge about those best practices to use Auth0's platform correctly without introducing more bugs and vulnerabilities. Thankfully, they've taken care of this by creating an excellent store of educational content on this topic to make integrating with them far easier. If you're interested in learning about how to work with Auth0, the best place to start is &lt;a href="https://auth0.com/blog/"&gt;their blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, it's the most powerful solution to one of the most common problems on the Internet: authentication. Auth0 earns a 8/10 from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#foxyio-foxycart"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://foxy.io/"&gt;Foxy.io&lt;/a&gt; (FoxyCart)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Snipcart is the easy-to-use, build-into-your-existing-website shopping cart solution, &lt;strong&gt;Foxy.io&lt;/strong&gt; is the super-powerful, only-for-devs, uber-customizable shopping cart solution. It's not better, just different from Snipcart, and so we use it in different scenarios. Perhaps when our small-town Mama's Pizza wants to start selling their pizzas online, Snipcart would be best, but Foxy.io might be the powerhouse needed to turn the gears behind BestBuy's website (large, but still with a single seller). Foxy.io doesn't manage inventory, while Snipcart does. Large sites like BestBuy likely are already handling that with a custom inventory solution, while something small like Mama's Pizza might make use of the inventory features of Snipcart to store their limited slate of pizza options. Foxy.io also can handle more payment gateways, which is unnecessary for smaller sites but could be critical for something as large as BestBuy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like how they put it on &lt;a href="https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/2.0/foxycarts_reason_for_being"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;: "FoxyCart is not a turnkey solution. This generally makes FoxyCart perfect for some and just plain wrong for others." I couldn't have said it better; Foxy.io (what they call it now) does the cart and checkout really well, but if that's not the largest part and central focus of your website, then you might be better off with a simple solution like Snipcart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's perfect for a small set of ecommerce sites, but go with Snipcart for everything else. I give it a solid 6/10 though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sendgrid"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://sendgrid.com/"&gt;SendGrid&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;strong&gt;SendGrid&lt;/strong&gt;. Where were you all my life? Emailing is super difficult. The World Wide Web has evolved for the last 25 years, but the whole emailing system is stuck in 1996. SendGrid is kind of like a translator between that nonsense we had to deal with ages ago and the modern way we work with APIs. With customer outreach, support, and marketing being such a big part of the ecommerce world, tools that can make emailing easy like SendGrid have become absolutely indispensable. There's not that much to say about SendGrid other than the fact that they're trusted with handling crucial parts of the architecture of big websites like eBay, Nextdoor, Uber, AirBNB, and Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does lean more towards being developer-friendly over content-creator-friendly, so you might find the interface a bit clunky if you're using SendGrid for blast emailing at a bigger company with dedicated marketers. It also looks like they funnel a lot of resources into development, which leaves customer support to focus on the biggest customers, so some smaller users have reported long stretches of time going by before hearing back from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I love SendGrid, and despite its minor flaws, it's always worked well for me. I give this one a 9.5/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#shopify"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.shopify.com/"&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were expecting this one, weren't you? I'll admit, I used to rail against &lt;strong&gt;Shopify&lt;/strong&gt;, and I still have my qualms, but I've come to see just how powerful it can be. It's probably the least technical tool on this list, so that immediately opens up all sorts of possibilities to non-developers. That's quite important to a lot of web development agencies as their developers then don't have to be bogged down with minor updates and can focus on future development, depending on how much you've customized the templates they give you. There's a massive community (as one would expect the largest ecommerce solution to garner), and they've created all sorts of plugins and templates to make the developer's job even easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat in that last pro, though. The plugin system can put the stability of your website in the hands of others, and we've seen that go well — and occasionally very, very badly — for Wordpress. Using plugins like this can open you up to vulnerabilities exposed by the plugin authors (who can be sometimes slow to fix them), so make sure to only use plugins created by companies you trust. Shopify also tends to be more of a platform than an add-on tool, so while you get the convenience of using prebuilt templates, it's much harder to customize and add non-ecommerce content. Many ecommerce companies run blogs or other informational pages, which aren't so easy to implement (it's definitely possible though!). Lastly, there's the fees. On top of the fee to use Shopify (which can be anywhere from $9 - $2000 depending on your needs), you'll likely be paying a fee on every transaction (plus your payment processor's fee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've grown to enjoy Shopify recently, but for many it's an acquired taste. Given just how powerful it can be, I'll give it a 7/10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it! That's my favorite 8 tools for turning a profit from your Jamstack site. It might've been historically difficult to combine ecommerce and the simplicity of the Jamstack, but thanks to tools like these 8, I'm hopeful that we'll be seeing more amazing ecommerce Jamstack experiences on the web in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've got any questions about TakeShape or about the list in general, feel free to contact us on Twitter (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/takeshapeio"&gt;@TakeShapeIO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jadenguitarman"&gt;@jadenguitarman&lt;/a&gt;) or at &lt;a href="http://takeshape.io/"&gt;takeshape.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JavaScript Quick Tip: Quickly Filter Out All Falsy Values From An Array</title>
      <author>Oliver Jumpertz</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 23:37:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/oliverjumpertz/javascript-quick-tip-quickly-filter-out-all-falsy-values-from-an-array-4bcj</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/oliverjumpertz/javascript-quick-tip-quickly-filter-out-all-falsy-values-from-an-array-4bcj</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with arrays in a functional way has mostly become the default when working with JavaScript these days. Why should you use a traditional imperative loop, like for, for..of, while, do..while, etc., when you can use map, filter, and forEach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These functional methods have one caveat, though: You can never throw from them without aborting the whole pipeline.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someConditionMet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// this is not the best idea...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someValidValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what do you do then? Well, you can return null to mark that you have an invalid result.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someConditionMet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now the pipeline can continue&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someValidValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That's fine. If you don't want your pipeline to abort, you can continue using null values as a marker for "this didn't work out".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to get rid of those values afterward? Perhaps something like this?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;someConditionMet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// now the pipeline can continue&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;someValidValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This leaves you only with valid values, which is perfectly fine, but we can make this even shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-code"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has first-class functions. You can pass any function reference to any other function that expects a function as this particular argument. And the Boolean constructor is actually the function responsible to define truthy and falsy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the filter step of this pipeline has run, you only have all truth values left, and can continue working with them without having to handle special cases like null or undefined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-whole-tip-as-an-image"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Whole Tip As An Image
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like visual content more, or if you want to store it for later, I put all this into one image for you. I hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ALPHA REACT 18 HAS ARRIVED </title>
      <author>michelledev</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 23:20:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/michelledev3/alpha-react-18-has-arrived-4712</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/michelledev3/alpha-react-18-has-arrived-4712</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The React team announced earlier this week that the initial preview for React 18 is live, and work has started for the React 18 release. This is an alpha release and not suitable for production but encourages testing and feedback. Now is the time that library authors can try React 18 and provide feedback and direction before its official release. A primary goal is to prepare the ecosystem for a smooth and graduation adoption of React 18 by using existing applications and libraries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-18-good-news"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React 18 Good News
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upgrades provided with React 18 do not require significant code changes!  We may need to repeat this and embrace the beauty of the good news.  Almost all of the benefits of the upgrade do not require code changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#react-18-highlights-ux-internal-architecture-and-more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  React 18 Highlights | UX, Internal Architecture, and More
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React 18 includes out-of-the-box improvements (automatic batching), new APIs ( ), and a new streaming server renderer with built-in support for  . React 18 also includes architectural improvements for React server-side rendering (SSR) performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-optin-mechanism"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  New Opt-In Mechanism?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrent Rendering (the new opt-in mechanism) and let's React prepare multiple versions of the UI simultaneously. This change is primarily behind the scenes, but it unlocks new possibilities to improve your app's actual and perceived performance.&lt;br&gt;
Since concurrency in React 18 is opt-in, there are no significant out-of-the-box breaking changes to component behavior. You can upgrade to React 18 with minimal or no changes to your application code, with a level of effort compared to a typical major React release. According to the working team at React, many users will be able to upgrade within a single afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-new-root-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The New Root API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ReactDOM.render() is now called the Legacy Root API. It works the same way as React 17. You can still use this but know that it will be deprecated eventually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
New Root API &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B8LZlIC7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bjcps0nxwelym290rmd6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B8LZlIC7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bjcps0nxwelym290rmd6.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very similar to the previous Root API.  With React 18 use &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WV9i_rAt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cly9n7vi7e73lfbgg713.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WV9i_rAt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cly9n7vi7e73lfbgg713.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br&gt;
The React 18 Root API change means:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• The hydrate method and render callback are gone&lt;br&gt;
• There is now a createRoot option  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you switch to the New Root API, you automatically get the new out-of-the-box improvements that come with React 18!&lt;br&gt;
This change is all you need to do to upgrade the client to React 18. If you only use React client-side, you are finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#starttransition-api"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  startTransition API
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new API helps with webpage responsiveness. The startTransition can not only keep current webpage responsive and able to perform heavy non-blocking UI updates at the same time. &lt;br&gt;
Think of it when a user types in a search box, the input value is immediately updated while the research results may wai t afew milliseconds. The API provides a way to differientation between quick and delayed updates. The delayed udpates is referred to as Transition Updates. &lt;br&gt;
Heavy UI or non-urgent updates we can wrap with startTransition API as:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tzhjWVUY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nwk6rgytutxux0p1fa0i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tzhjWVUY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nwk6rgytutxux0p1fa0i.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#serverside-rending-improvements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Server-Side Rending Improvements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React 18 offers full support for Suspense; if you remember, React 16 had support but not full support. &lt;br&gt;
Suspense is a functionality set that allows for waiting for data to resolve before a state transition (delayed transitions), reducing UI clashes while data loads (placeholder throttling), and coordinating the appearance of a set of components by streaming them in order (SuspenseList). With React 18, we can break React components into smaller chunks using .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#timeline"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TimeLine
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no specific release date scheduled, but we should expect something over the next few months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
• Library Alpha: Available June 2021&lt;br&gt;
• Public Beta: June 2021 + a few months &lt;br&gt;
• Release Candidate (RC): Several weeks post Beta Release &lt;br&gt;
• General Availability: Several weeks post RC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#alpha-beta-gamma-the-good-old-days-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Alpha, Beta, Gamma? (the good old days ;)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#alpha"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Alpha
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial preview.  Most features are stable, but work is being done to finalizes new APIs   and stylesheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#beta"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Beta
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once React 18 is feature complete, the React 18 Beta will be released.  The Beta version includes all of the breaking changes and new features to the final release. Beta is also a time for a larger community (outside of the library authors) to start trying React 18, provide feedback, and report any remaining issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  RC
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When React 18 is fully feature complete and confident in the stability of the release, it becomes a release candidate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#stable"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Stable
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then React 18 can release!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am excited to check out the Alpha, as React 17 was the building block for the highly anticipated React 18. I would love to read your insights on the new alpha. &lt;br&gt;

      <title>2021 Best Laptops for Software Development</title>
      <author>Hello Dev World Blog</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 22:28:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/hellodevworldblog/2021-best-laptops-for-software-development-573p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/hellodevworldblog/2021-best-laptops-for-software-development-573p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post contains affiliate links. If you use these links to buy something we may earn a commission. Thanks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I often get asked what the best computer for doing software development is and I kind of hate that question because the answer is it depends. Are you only going to use it for software development? What else do you want to do on it? What operating system do you want? What kind of development are you going to be doing? So ya. It depends and arguably you could do development from just your phone. Nothing special needed. However, I will do my best to make a top 5 list of best laptop choices for software development (in no particular order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-macbook-pro-13"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35d1a3q"&gt;MacBook Pro 13”&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so this is a hot topic but I love using a &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35d1a3q"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; for development. I’ve been using them for years and never had issues. It’s also a must-have if you are doing ruby development as you may run into issues with it on a PC. The reason I say a &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35d1a3q"&gt;13” MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is because the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35bOxp5"&gt;16” versions&lt;/a&gt; don’t have the M1 chip yet. It is on its way but not out yet. When that comes out I will be updating this for that instead. You can never have too much real estate when developing especially for web developers. If you are looking to do App development and want to support apple devices an &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cBs74K"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35d1a3q"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; will be a must-have as you need them to compile your apps and release them to the store. If you are a game engineer the screens on the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35d1a3q"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; are incredible and with the new M1 chips you shouldn’t have any issue with processing power although they may run a little hot. I also get the higher RAM and storage because I would rather have more and not need it than need it but not have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-razer-blade-15"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35fsUEi"&gt;Razer Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are leaning more towards a pc the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35fsUEi"&gt;razer blade 15 with a RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; is a great choice. I love this laptop because is a beast and super portable. I used to have this laptop for traveling because I liked that I could do work and gaming on the laptop. If you want a lot of power in a small laptop this is a great choice. The screen is also amazing. It also has plenty of processing power for the game developers and a great screen for them to work on. If you are doing .NET development (not core but anything other than core) you will want to opt for a PC as you won’t be able to do it on a mac. Again I opt for the higher ram and if possible get more storage. I also opt for &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/35fsUEi"&gt;the 3070&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gdVJYc"&gt;the 3060&lt;/a&gt; because I use it for gaming and would rather have the power than not. The extra power is also a must if you are going to be doing game development or video processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-asus-rog-zephyrus%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BF"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3iyW9dh"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus﻿﻿&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually the current laptop that I have as my travel laptop. It is such a beast of a computer for a great price. It isn’t too heavy and has enough power for gaming as well as web development. If you want the best screen around this isn’t the best choice you get a lot for your money with this laptop. You get a great amount of storage and RAM in a small laptop for around $2000. I have last years’ version and since then they have unfortunately raised the prices I think due to the expense of the new graphics cards but I still think this years’ is a great choice for a great price. They do have a &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ivtKoq"&gt;cheaper option with a 3060&lt;/a&gt; instead of a 3070 personally I think it’s worth the extra for the better graphics card but I also play some graphics-intensive games. Again if you are doing .NET development (not core but anything other than core) you will want to opt for a PC as you won’t be able to do it on a mac. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-surface-pro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2RMpupv"&gt;Surface Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always found &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2RMpupv"&gt;surface pros&lt;/a&gt; really interesting. At this point, they are a great very portable option. However, they are more like tablets which bother some people. They do run the full Windows OS and can definitely handle web development. I wouldn’t choose this if you are a game developer as I don’t think it would have enough processing power. But if you are looking for a lightweight very portable option for development definitely check one of these out! One these I actually opt for the cheaper options because you won’t be using this for much more than web development or basic web browsing and I don’t think it’s worth the extra cost for the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cBc6vy"&gt;upgraded version with more RAM and storage&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2RMpupv"&gt;lower version&lt;/a&gt; can handle everything you’d be doing on it. Again if you are doing .NET development (not core but anything other than core) you will want to opt for a PC as you won’t be able to do it on a mac although visual studio (the full IDE) does take a good amount of processing power usually so if you will be doing this I would consider the upgraded version of the surface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-dell-xps-15"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gceQBU"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a .Net developer or work in a PC shop you will most likely have used this before or may currently be using it. Say what you will about dell but I never had issues developing on an &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3gceQBU"&gt;XPS&lt;/a&gt;. They are a super solid option if you are doing web development as they are plenty powerful but don’t have all the bells and whistles that you pay extra for in other computers. I don’t think they are the best option for gaming devs or people who want to also use their laptops for gaming but if you just want to use your computer for development this is a very solid and cheap option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you when deciding on your next laptop you really can’t go wrong with any of the options just keep in mind the type of development you want to do and what else you may want to do on the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working with Sprite Sheets in Unity</title>
      <author>Joseph Maurer</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 21:22:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mwrpwr/working-with-sprite-sheets-in-unity-3pjb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mwrpwr/working-with-sprite-sheets-in-unity-3pjb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sprites are a vital part of working on a game in Unity. Part of that is how do you go about slicing a sprite that contains multiple images within it. I’m going to spend some time going through a basic example of how to split a sprite and hook it up to an animation 2D platform game! Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQXs_w_IaxU"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start you are going to need to acquire a sprite sheet from somewhere. &lt;a href="https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-characters"&gt;Here is a link to where I acquired the platform character for this project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f0XT5P9C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t7jic13nw3vngha2gxhq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--f0XT5P9C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t7jic13nw3vngha2gxhq.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once imported into Unity, you are going to need to splice the sprite. You can do this in a number of ways, but I suggest starting by seeing if Unity can automatically figure out each of the images. To do this, use automatic mode as pictured below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MBjApIbT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfwq7c16fldqx9izuxw4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MBjApIbT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfwq7c16fldqx9izuxw4.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once finished, you will see a light grey box around each of the images in the sheet. Hit Apply and let Unity work the magic behind the scenes to cut each image into a usable asset. You will know it is done when you can expand the sheet and see each image appended. Something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O3-XakX1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qvagop9t3kvxjmc1hbpx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O3-XakX1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qvagop9t3kvxjmc1hbpx.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can start making your animations for your character. In my basic example, this just involved swapping the sprites on each possible state to be the correct image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Expose lots of variables within your Animator so that it’s easy to tell your player how to move!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nfS1t8DY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ridzxlkjb3vvnalmb4vz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nfS1t8DY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ridzxlkjb3vvnalmb4vz.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you’re done! You now have an easy way to control your player in code so that you can make a cool game!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I hope this tip helps! Follow me on twitter for more tech tips!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Validate Your Endpoints Using Spring</title>
      <author>Abdulcelil Cercenazi</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 21:16:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jarjanazy/validate-your-endpoints-using-spring-4l3e</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jarjanazy/validate-your-endpoints-using-spring-4l3e</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-we-want-to-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What Do We Want To Do?&lt;/strong&gt; 🤔
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply validation to the objects we receive at the endpoint controllers from clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-the-first-solution-that-comes-to-mind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What Is The First Solution That Comes To Mind?&lt;/strong&gt; 🧠
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's simple, right? write functions that validate those objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we have an endpoint to add new Shipments. 🚚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the DTO classes (Data Transfer Object)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RequiredArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RequiredArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the controller&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@PostMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"/shipment/add"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RequestBody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getProductCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;badRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Product code can't be null"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;badRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Count can't be negative or zero"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;allComponentsAreValid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;badRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Component product code can't be null"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;allComponentsAreValid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getShipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="nf"&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;  
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;allMatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getProductCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#notice-all-the-manual-tedious-work-we-had-to-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Notice all the manual tedious work we had to do.🤕
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cant-anyone-help-us-make-this-task-more-fun"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Can't anyone help us make this task more fun?😏
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#please-meet-the-javax-validator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Please meet the Javax validator.🥳
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides a set of annotations that are used with class fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They act as constraints.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this field should not be null&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this list should have a minimum size of 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and many more...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-do-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to do it?👀
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the object we want to validate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We annotate the fields we want to validate with annotations from

&lt;code&gt;javax.validation.constraints&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, we annotate the parameter of the controller where we want to validate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then have to catch the error thrown by the validator, and return a proper response to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lets-code-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let's code it 🦾
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the DTO objects&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RequiredArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NotBlank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Component product code can't be null"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// required by the javax validation code  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;ShipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RequiredArgsConstructor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Getter&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NotBlank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Product code can't be null"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;productCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Component product code can't be empty"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@NotNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"Component product code can't be null"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Valid&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentComponentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentComponentDTOs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ok-what-were-those-annotations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ok, what were those annotations?👇
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NotBlank

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This field can't be null or empty string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Min

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this integer should have a min value we specify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this array's size should be within the boundaries we specify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NotNull

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This field must not be null &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valid

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate the fields in this object &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-here-is-the-controller"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now, here is the controller👇
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RestController&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentController_Validation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@PostMapping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"validation/shipment/add"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;addShipment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@RequestBody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Validated&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ShipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shipmentDTO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-that-validated-annotation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was that @Validated annotation?🤨
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it tells Spring to run the validation mechanism on this object according to its validation annotations(NotBlank, etc..)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finally-lets-catch-the-exception-thrown-by-the-validator-and-generate-a-proper-response"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finally, let's catch the exception thrown by the validator and generate a proper response
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@Order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Ordered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@ControllerAdvice&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ValidationAdvice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@ResponseStatus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;BAD_REQUEST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@ResponseBody&lt;/span&gt;  
 &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@ExceptionHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MethodArgumentNotValidException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;methodArgumentNotValidException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;MethodArgumentNotValidException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;BindingResult&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getBindingResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;FieldError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fieldErrors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getFieldErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;errorMessage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fieldErrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getDefaultMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ResponseEntity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;badRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;errorMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In conclusion✍️
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine having an API with many endpoints that we need to validate. Which method would be better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Validator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-on-github"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code on &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jarjanazy/Spring-Validation-demo"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>CSP - Content Security Policy</title>
      <author>Jordan Finneran</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 21:10:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/jordanfinners/csp-content-security-policy-d3c</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/jordanfinners/csp-content-security-policy-d3c</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Contents
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="#directives"&gt;Directives&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="#values"&gt;Values&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#intro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Intro &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly but by no means least, carrying on from my previous blog about &lt;a href="https://jordanfinners.dev/blogs/website-security-week"&gt;website security week&lt;/a&gt;, we're going to talk about CSP or Content Security Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"&gt;CSP is Content Security Policy&lt;/a&gt; this is one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to secure your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are two ways to to set your content security policy, either as a header &lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy&lt;/code&gt; or via a meta tag in your HTML for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; img-src https://google.com; child-src 'none';"&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#directives"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Directives &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content policy is made up of directives (the thing to restrict) and the value(s) on how it can be restricted. We won't cover all all the possible directives in this blog but you can find &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#directives"&gt;a list of all the directives here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They syntax is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: directive value; directive value value; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some key directives you should set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#defaultsrc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  default-src
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests this is the fallback if there aren't more specific directives used. I'd recommend setting it to 'none'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#connectsrc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  connect-src
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This affects what you can 'connect' to via fetch and make HTTP requests to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; connect-src https://some.api.com; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#imgsrc"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  img-src
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This affects where you can load images from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; img-src https://some.img.host https://another.img.place; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#formaction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  form-action
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This affects where you can send form submissions to via the HTML form attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; form-action https://some.api.host; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the directives you should set on your content security policy. The more specific your content security policy directives the stronger your policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#values"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Values &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can specify many different types of values for each directive and its important to understand the affect of each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#none"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  'none'
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won't allow loading of any resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#self"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  'self'
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only allow resources from the current domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hosts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hosts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow loading from any number of hosts, it can also have an optional protocol e.g. http:// or https://, an optional port e.g. some.website:8080, and/or an optional path e.g. &lt;a href="https://some.website/path/to/file"&gt;https://some.website/path/to/file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: img-src https://some.img.host some.other.images.com img.org:8080 img.co.uk/path/to/img.jpg; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#schema"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Schema
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set just a schema e.g. https:, http:, data: but I generally wouldn't recommend this except perhaps for inline images which are data:xxxx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: img-src data:; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nonce"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Nonce
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works in conjunction with the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-nonce"&gt;script HTML tag nonce attribute&lt;/a&gt;, the server must generate a unique value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: script-src nonce-DhcnhD3khTMePgXwdayK9BsMqXjhguVV; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sha"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  SHA
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a SHA hash of a resource for example, if you apply a content security policy the browser will generate these for you to use if you cannot use any of the other values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: script-src sha256-jzgBGA4UWFFm; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use any of these values in combination with one another to lockdown your content security policy as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' &lt;a href="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com"&gt;https://static.cloudflareinsights.com&lt;/a&gt;; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' &lt;a href="https://cloudflareinsights.com"&gt;https://cloudflareinsights.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://api.challenge.new"&gt;https://api.challenge.new&lt;/a&gt;; font-src 'self'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; manifest-src 'self';&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Summary &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, setting a content security policy is one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to secure your website. It can take some time to set up a strict content security policy but that time is payed back tenfold in the benefits it provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set that content security policy now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Building!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS Location Service: Where my AWS Community Builders at?  </title>
      <author>Jared Donboch</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 20:46:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-location-service-where-my-aws-community-builders-at-e02</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-location-service-where-my-aws-community-builders-at-e02</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; I built a map of AWS Community Builders using AWS Location Services.  &lt;a href="http://acbmap.humbleg.com/aws/"&gt;Click here for the map&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jdonboch/acbmap-aws"&gt;click here for the code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;I was recently accepted into the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/"&gt;AWS Community Builders program&lt;/a&gt; and have been blown away by how geographically diverse the group is.  The program is split up into different technology-based cohorts--although this is very loose coupling and members are free to join discussions and sessions for any set of technology they are interested in--but there is no location based grouping.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to many asking the same question: are there any other AWS Community Builders near me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager of the program, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasondunn"&gt;Jason Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to share some anonymized location data with me and I volunteered to draft a quick proof-of-concept map that would display the locations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially implemented this via &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview"&gt;Google Maps JS API&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jdonboch/acbmap"&gt;code can be found here&lt;/a&gt;) but with the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-location-service-is-now-generally-available-with-new-routing-and-satellite-imagery-capabilities/"&gt;release of AWS Location Service&lt;/a&gt;, I decided it was worth trying to experiment with this new service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-amazon-location-service"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Amazon Location Service?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/location/"&gt;Amazon Location Service&lt;/a&gt; is a new set of resources to support maps and location-based use cases such as geocoding, routing, asset/device tracking and geo-fence events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the writing of this, the AWS Location Service has been GA for less than 2 weeks.  I look forward to new features and integrations that will inevitably come in the future as the service continues to get some exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#initial-impressions-of-maps-and-geocoding"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Initial Impressions (of Maps and Geocoding)
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my initial impressions.  I have only really experimented with maps and geocoding to support this simple use case.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The routing, tracking and geofencing components look very interesting but I don't have any direct experience with them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#good-great-integration-with-other-aws-services"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Good: Great integration with other AWS Services
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already in the AWS eco-system, using Amazon Location Services will be very easy as you can continue to use the tools and SDKs you are already using.  You can control access and security via IAM, automate deployments via CloudFormation, monitor with CloudWatch, be notified of location-based events via Amazon EventBridge, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#good-creates-an-abstraction-for-various-location-providers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Good: Creates an abstraction for various location providers.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon currently supports its clients using &lt;a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home"&gt;Esri&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.here.com/"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; data sets and services.  When you create Amazon resources for maps, places, etc you choose which provider you want to supply the data.  Each provider has their own strengths and weakness but you can now switch easily without needing to integrate with each unique location provider API.  As new providers are added, you can continue to leverage the same interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#good-better-privacy-and-security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Good: Better privacy and security
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS does not have rights to sell your data or use it for advertising purposes (can Google say that?).  They also anonymize all your requests before submitting them to vendors.  Any tracking and geofence data is stored only in your AWS account (not 3rd parties) which gives you the power to control and secure that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-so-good-free-tierpricing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not so good: Free Tier/Pricing
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS offers a free tier but it is only a 3-month trial.  After 3 months, you are on the hook for your requests based usage.  &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing"&gt;Google Maps free-tier equivalent&lt;/a&gt; (free mobile usage and $200 maps credit each month) does not expire and is much more generous.  The maps and geocoding prices are competitive with other services but Amazon charges on a per-tile basis when many other providers charge on a per map-load basis.  This means if your users are zooming and panning frequently, you will likely be paying more for Amazon Location Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pricing makes Amazon Location Services a little less desirable for individuals, small prototyping efforts, and mobile map applications that are extremely price sensitive as you'll probably end up paying when other providers (i.e. Google) you can do a lot more with their free tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that Amazon creates a more permanent free-tier for the mapping service at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-so-good-lacking-access-controls-for-anonymous-access-to-public-maps"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not so good: Lacking access controls for anonymous access to public maps.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Location Services provides an API that can be connected to other map libraries (i.e. &lt;a href="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js"&gt;MapLibre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/tangrams/tangram"&gt;Tangram&lt;/a&gt;).  This is sort of nice but it requires you to use a Cognito Identity Pool with anonymous access enabled if you want to display on a public website.  This is well documented in their &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/amazon-location-developer-guide.pdf.pdf"&gt;developer guide&lt;/a&gt; but I feel like there are some access-controls lacking as there is no way to lock down your anonymous credentials to a particular IP or HTTP referrer like you can do with Google's API Keys.  This means someone could grab the Cognito Identity Pool ID from the Javascript source code in the browser and use it for their own map requests.  This seems like a big flaw and hoping some additional Conditional support could be added to IAM policies to better control anonymous access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#creating-the-map-and-geocoding-the-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Creating the map and geocoding the data
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete this proof of concept, I needed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a list of locations, I needed to 1) geocode the locations to get their latitudes and longitudes and then 2) create a static map webpage to display the locations as markers on a map.  Bonus points if we can add some metadata on the markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-map"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The map
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was not much innovation for the map part of the project and just a quick proof of concept was the goal.  It was accomplished by walking through the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/amazon-location-developer-guide.pdf.pdf"&gt;following sections of the AWS Location Service Developer Guide&lt;/a&gt; which is a great resource to get started! :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 27: &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/authenticating-using-cognito.html"&gt;Allowing unauthenticated guest access to your
application using Amazon Cognito&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 33: &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/maps-prerequisites.html#create-map-resource"&gt;Creating a Map Resource&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 34: &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/maps-prerequisites.html#tutorial-mapbox-identity-pool"&gt;Authenticating your requests&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 35: &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/tutorial-maplibre-gl-js.html"&gt;Using MapLibre GL JS with Amazon Location Service&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used some MapLibre tutorials below to help create the markers, icons and pop ups on the map:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/example/add-image/"&gt;Add icon to map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/example/cluster/"&gt;Create and style clusters (stole the pop up code here)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-geocoding-process"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The geocoding process
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/places-prerequisites.html#create-place-index-resource"&gt;create a Place Index resource&lt;/a&gt; to support the geocoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the geocoding and create the GeoJSON that is displayed by the map, I wrote a quick Python script to perform that. This was fairly easy since the geocoding actions have been added to boto3 (i.e. the Python AWS SDK).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the only location information that we had for Amazon Community Builders was Country.  This resulted in many  duplicate markers being generated which the mapping library was not happy about.  In the end, I adjusted the logic of the geocoding script to create a single point for each country but then add properties to the point that indicated the number of people in that country.  This member count property could then be displayed as a pop up on the map when the user hovered over the map marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-results"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Results
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the final code and the geocoding script, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jdonboch/acbmap-aws"&gt;check out the acbmap-aws repo on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.  I tried to add more details to that README with the specifics if you want to try and run this locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the a hosted version of the AWS Community Builders map, powered by Amazon Location Services, at the following location:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://acbmap.humbleg.com/aws/"&gt;http://acbmap.humbleg.com/aws/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Data Types of Javascript</title>
      <author>Thomas(Tripp) White </author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 20:32:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/turpp/the-data-types-of-javascript-4p1f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/turpp/the-data-types-of-javascript-4p1f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Javascript has evolved into one of the most robust languages. Before javascript was just mainly focused on adding some interactivity to the web, but now we are able to build mobile application with React Native, backend with Node.js and even desktop applications with Electron. To take advantage of all this functionality we need to make sure we have our basic Javascript fundamentals down. Today I want to talk about the different data types in Javascript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#primitive-vs-nonprimitive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Primitive vs Non-Primitive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main categories data types fall into with javascript. You have primitive and non-primitive. Why is this important? Depending on its category will determine how javascript stores and references the information. A primitive data types stores a single value and are passed by value. A non-primitive data type can store multiple values and are passed by reference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#primitive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Primitive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clear things up, a primitive data type are things like boolean, strings, and numbers. Being passed by value means if you assign one variable the value of a different variable it stores just the value. Example: &lt;code&gt;let x=“hi”&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;let y=x&lt;/code&gt;. y is assigned ‘hi’. In background when y is assigned x, Javascript takes 'hi' and creates a new space in memory to reference. This keeps x and y separated from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3bTCXOXD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t3luttk1ia7o5sunctpa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3bTCXOXD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t3luttk1ia7o5sunctpa.png" alt="primitive being passed by value"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  String
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A string is a group of characters inside of quotes. Javascript lets you use both single and double quotes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dogs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#number"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Number
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents a number and can be assigned with or without decimals. They are 64-bit floating point values and have a limit to how big a number can be.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bigint"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  BigInt
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is used to store numbers larger than what the number data type can hold.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bigNum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;87956239487562934765239847562398745638974562983745623987456&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#boolean"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Boolean
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditional values of true and false. You can set variables to a boolean value or you can also compare and that will return a boolean value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;bol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//return true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;33&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//return false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#undefined"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Undefined
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when you declare a variable but never assign it a value. Javascript will automatically assign it an undefined value.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//value of x is undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//same as declaring without assigning value = undefined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#null"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Null
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Represents a non-existent or invalid value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#symbol"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Symbol
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used to store an anonymous and unique value. This a new data type that was introduced with ES6.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sym&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Symbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nonprimitive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Non-primitive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-primitive data types are things like arrays and objects. They can hold multiple values inside of them. Being passed by reference means that if you assign a non-primitive data type to a variable it actually stores the location of the original variable and not the value. This can lead to some tricky errors to fix if not managed correctly. Example &lt;code&gt;let x=[1,2,3]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let y=x&lt;/code&gt;. In the example we are not assigning y the value of [1,2,3] like we would for a primitive data type. We are actually assigning it x. In the background when we assign &lt;code&gt;y=x&lt;/code&gt; Javascripts looks for the location in memory that represents x. It will then assign that location to y. This means if we make any changes to x it will also reflect in y.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HMdiuoCe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2aho7hfu17gaqksuywqe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HMdiuoCe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2aho7hfu17gaqksuywqe.png" alt="Non-Primitive being passed by reference"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#object"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Object
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stores a collection of data. If the data type is non-primitive it will always an object type in javascript.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Tripp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;dogDad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this quick summary of data types in Javascript useful. They are pretty straight forward but if not managed correctly can lead to some tricky errors to debug. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let's Dive into React (Pt. 4)</title>
      <author>Abdur-Rahman</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 20:31:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/shafspecs/let-s-dive-into-react-pt-4-jhf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/shafspecs/let-s-dive-into-react-pt-4-jhf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let's continue from where we &lt;a href="https://dev.to/shafspecs/let-s-dive-into-react-pt-3-2647"&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt; in the last article, wherein we created a component and returned our first HTML element using JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to build a counter and a thing to note is, a component can range from a HTML tag to an entire webpage. Let's try and think of the 'components' or different parts of our counter-app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have the background and that's where everything will be located. Secondly, we have a counter that shows the current count we are on. Thirdly, we have a button to increase the count of the number displayed by one. Lastly, another button to decrease the count number by one.That's a simple breakdown of our counter app that we will be making. Let's begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component will be our main component for this project, remember, we have a header at the top, then the numbers, then the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the header,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Counter App&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have our header created in the div, let's create the count component. Remember, we can add an HTML tag, some JavaScript and keep writing, but let's make it another component to keep our code clean and short. Let's create a folder called &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; to store all our other components. Inside, we create the file &lt;code&gt;Counter.jsx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1MDLX6C8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dfnrn1otwwqiwtzfut9w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1MDLX6C8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dfnrn1otwwqiwtzfut9w.png" alt="component folder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create a function called &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; after importing React and return a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's just add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag with 0 as its value, we will come back to add functionality. But, we must first import it into our &lt;code&gt;App.jsx&lt;/code&gt; to render it on the page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./components/Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Counter App&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u_n_R8ZF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7at8eg8bwqag19c5nnbu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u_n_R8ZF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7at8eg8bwqag19c5nnbu.png" alt="Good counter added"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's add a button component the same way we added the counter, except instead of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, we will use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. And import it into our &lt;code&gt;App.jsx&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;br&gt;
Our &lt;code&gt;App.jsx&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./components/Counter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./components/Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Counter App&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and our page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JhqyXBR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nd01w5gywz442obg0q1o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JhqyXBR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nd01w5gywz442obg0q1o.png" alt="Our new page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, we have done quite a lot, we have added our components, rendered them through &lt;code&gt;index.jsx&lt;/code&gt; and will now explain how to control the update of our counter number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a problem, it means if we want to change counter, each time we click we re-render the page. That would be very inconvenient, cause that means for example, if we have a form with verification, we will refresh the page every time a value is inputted. That's where states come in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A state is a JavaScript object that is managed within a component (similar to variables declared within a function), and influences the output of a component. There is no need for re-rendering at all, it's just like a variable that changes value within a function that can change value while the function is running, without need to re-call the function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we create a state and change it? First, we import the (non-default) function &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; module in the &lt;code&gt;App.jsx&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;strong&gt;Make sure it is written between curly braces&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2U5eSanb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2efvfxzop22brnjw35s.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2U5eSanb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2efvfxzop22brnjw35s.png" alt="Line 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we use array destructuring to initialize our state. This is the general syntax of &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nameOfVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;functionToUpdateVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;defaultValueOfVariable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; is always written outside the return method&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The default value of a state can be a string, number, array, boolean or even object.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's create ours and call it &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; and the function to update &lt;code&gt;setCount&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's now set the &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; component to be &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; and the default value to be the &lt;code&gt;useState&lt;/code&gt; default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; variable and the &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; are in 2 different files. How will we connect them? The answer is 'Component Properties' or called &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; for short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short, props are objects that transfer data between a parent component and it's child component and vice-versa. What is a parent and child component? A parent component is the one that imports a component while the child component is the one being exported.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's transfer the count to the &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; component. The way props are moved between a parent and it's child is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Parent component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;nameProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;ageProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Child Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;My name is &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nameProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;His age is &lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ageProp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's dissect what's above, we have two variables, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; (Props can be &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; data and datatype, not just states). And we want to display them in our child component. In our parent component, we give them a custom name (any name literally), and set it to the data we want to pass. Notice the variables written in curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Any JavaScript written in JSX's HTML is written between curly braces, i.e written in the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the child component, we accept the &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; argument.  Recall we called &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; an object, and the values of the object are what we set in the parent component. So, we get each prop we passed, and using the rule above, wrote the props in curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see how that will look in our &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//App.jsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Counter.jsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Counter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;h3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We passed &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt; above with the name &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;(name it whatever you like. This is &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; own project), accepted it, and displayed it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82GIifEA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nt8381ryzsmbok8eupxb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--82GIifEA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nt8381ryzsmbok8eupxb.png" alt="Our state"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you change the default value of the state and save, it will automatically change in the browser. In the next article, we will learn how to use the button to change numbers and make the way we write our &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; shorter. See you in the next article.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Completely Biased Reasons for Choosing Angular</title>
      <author>John Woodruff</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 20:14:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/johnbwoodruff/my-completely-biased-reasons-for-choosing-angular-1hbg</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/johnbwoodruff/my-completely-biased-reasons-for-choosing-angular-1hbg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted the title to be painfully obvious. Just in case that didn't make it obvious enough, let me be even more clear. &lt;strong&gt;This is my completely biased opinion.&lt;/strong&gt; You possibly vehemently disagree with me on this, &lt;em&gt;and that's okay.&lt;/em&gt; This is not a post to try to claim Angular is better than React or Vue or Svelt or whatever other framework you're in love with. It's literally a post talking about why I, John Woodruff, choose to use Angular in personal projects small and large. Honestly, I'm not even trying to convince you to use Angular. In fact, my honest advice for picking a framework for a project is to pick the one you know the best, so you can be as productive as possible. So let's get all that out of the way up front, and dive into my &lt;strong&gt;heavily biased&lt;/strong&gt; reasons for choosing Angular for personal projects. Keep in mind, when I make a statement it's an entirely opinion-based statement, so take it with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#opinionated-framework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Opinionated Framework
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about one of the hottest topics up front. Angular is an opinionated framework. If you're not sure what that means, basically it's that the Angular framework defines how you should build applications, and they provide all of the essential tools you need to be able to build your applications. They provide solutions for routing, data fetching, internal data flow, and more, all bundled in the framework itself. Contrast this with something less opinionated like React which specifically does not define how you should build applications, it's simply a library to build components. You can then pick and choose any number of libraries for all the pieces you need to build your application, specifically the same things I mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is that a hot topic? Well, opinionated or less-opinionated frameworks or libraries elicit all sorts of responses from the developers who use them. Many developers are very against opinionated frameworks, where many other developers love opinionated frameworks. So naturally many of the arguments both in favor of and against Angular are based on the fact that it's a highly opinionated framework. They have rigid structure for how Angular apps should be built, and many tools included out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well here we come to my first of several biased opinions. I love Angular because it's an opinionated framework. I love that I don't have to pick and choose from a million libraries to put together a complex app. 95% of what I need is already included in the Angular framework. I also don't need to decide "how" I want to build my applications, because Angular has a detailed style guide for building applications, and I'm able to focus entirely on the actual implementation of my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why I love Angular for large complex apps within work environments. When working on teams there is often friction due to different teams or team members doing things differently. With Angular you eliminate a lot of that, because there are defined ways of doing things, and so it's far easier to scale across an organization. Having worked on large complex applications in work environments using both Angular and React, it's been infinitely easier to work within Angular applications due to the lack of a lot of the friction we had with the large React applications. It came down to Angular being opinionated, so there was far less mental overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#angular-cli"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Angular CLI
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--00VIzWed--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ma3ch7wrceuafrraz4nw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--00VIzWed--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ma3ch7wrceuafrraz4nw.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah the &lt;a href="https://angular.io/cli"&gt;Angular CLI&lt;/a&gt;. This goes right along with the previous point of Angular being opinionated. The Angular CLI is the best way to build Angular applications due to it tightly following the Angular style guide. It generates a fully scaffolded Angular project for you, and has numerous generator commands for adding new components, services, modules, etc., has automated testing all set up for you out of the box, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also completely controls your build process, which means they fully manage the building and optimizing of your application. So all of your production builds make use of optimizations such as ahead-of-time compilation, source code minification, tree shaking, style auto-prefixing, and more. This is all stuff that you would have to figure out and do yourself using a build tool and numerous libraries and plugins. Instead of wasting time on all that, I can enjoy knowing that the Angular CLI is generating the best possible production build for me and I can focus on building awesome features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#version-updates"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Version Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of Angular CLI, if not the best feature, is the &lt;code&gt;ng update&lt;/code&gt; command. Ever since Angular 6 was released, the Angular CLI has included this command. It takes basically all the work out of doing version upgrades, and the Angular team did an absolutely phenomenal job of making this command work exceptionally well. They even have a super helpful &lt;a href="https://update.angular.io/"&gt;Update Guide&lt;/a&gt; which gives detailed instructions, but almost all of them say that the changes should be automated by the &lt;code&gt;ng update&lt;/code&gt; command. Normally when you have a major version update, you would have to manually go through your app updating dependencies, delving into changelogs, changing code in your app in numerous places to get rid of deprecated or removed features, and then painstakingly testing to make sure you haven't broken anything. This command, however, automates essentially all of that, including running code migrations that automatically migrate you to the latest recommended syntax. There have only been a handful of times where the changes required manual intervention in the code, and usually they were exceptionally quick to resolve. All the rest is fully automated by Angular CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since this command was released, I have spent approximately 5-10 minutes updating to the latest each time a new major version is released. Contrast this with major version upgrades that can sometimes take hours or even days to update your large complex applications to the latest versions.  It even allows library authors to define their own schematics to automatically update their libraries, and that's awesome for users of the framework to not have to worry about manually keeping those up to date when they can just automate it. This has saved me countless hours every single time a major version is released, and I am completely spoiled when using other frameworks that don't provide this incredible functionality. (that's actually another upside to opinionated frameworks, it allows features like this that are otherwise unrealistic with unopinionated frameworks) The Angular team absolutely knocked it out of the park with this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#angular-cdk"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Angular CDK
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HuuUlCJX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/57kdgmqg64na4zple6td.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HuuUlCJX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/57kdgmqg64na4zple6td.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io"&gt;Angular Material&lt;/a&gt; is a super awesome little package called &lt;a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories"&gt;Angular CDK&lt;/a&gt;. CDK stands for Component Dev Kit, and it is an incredibly handy package for helping you develop some of the more complex components an application requires. They're marketed as "behavior primitives" that you can use to build your own branded components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building buttons and input fields and such are fairly straightforward for people building component libraries, but there are other components that are much more complex such as modals, accordions, data tables, drag and drop, trees, and more. Rather than building all this yourself or relying on libraries that style these components how they want, Angular CDK gives you ways to very easily build your own complex behavioral components that you can style easily to fit your company or project's branding. Not only that, but these components are often much more accessible than components you would build yourself. As has been the theme with this post, Angular CDK helps you save a ton of time by having these abstractions built out for you so you can worry about the look, feel, and implementation of your components rather than the more complex details such as positioning, scroll behaviors, etc. It has saved me an enormous amount of time and complexity when building my components. If you're building with Angular, even if you don't use Angular Material, you should absolutely use Angular CDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#dependency-injection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Dependency Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hot topic for some reason, but Dependency Injection is another huge reason why I love to use Angular. It allows me to not have to worry about defining my own patterns for singleton vs factories. Instead, &lt;a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection"&gt;Angular's Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt; tooling makes it exceptionally easy for me to provide the dependencies I need, anywhere I need them, and to do it in an easy manner. Rather than have to instantiate a service in a component, I can simply inject my service and Angular's Dependency Injection will ensure I am given the correctly instantiated service, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Some service I've defined&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Some component in my app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other huge benefit to Dependency Injection is for better testability. Automated tests are something that I consider absolutely vital to the success or failure of a product and the team that builds it. Dependency Injection in Angular makes it incredibly easy to test, mock out, and handle dependencies external to the unit of code I'm testing at the moment. Consider the above component. To mock a method I simply need to inject the correct dependency and then utilize Jasmine's spies to mock out the method.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;MyComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;beforeEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Initialize Angular TestBed&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TestBed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;configureTestingModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;compileComponents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Inject MyService for mocking&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;TestBed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Mock out `sayHello` method&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;spyOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;returnValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It makes working in large complex codebases much more trivial, and makes testing vastly more simple. Are there downsides to Dependency Injection? Absolutely. No matter what pattern you choose, there are always going to be tradeoffs. It comes down to what tradeoffs you're willing to make in exchange for the benefits you consider most valuable. For me, Angular's Dependency Injection is one of the main reasons I choose it over other frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you've forgotten by this point, I'll reiterate one more time that this post is incredibly biased and entirely opinion-based. I absolutely love to use Angular, it's my framework of choice for side projects, and I believe it's an excellent choice for many of you as well. &lt;em&gt;That being said,&lt;/em&gt; I absolutely would argue that it's not a good choice for many others. When it comes down to it, you need to weigh the pros and cons of each framework, decide what tradeoffs you're willing to make, and choose based on what you decide. For many of you that's going to be React, or Vue, or Svelt, or Stencil, or Ember, or heck maybe even Backbone. And that's absolutely okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this article to provide perspective to why I personally choose Angular over another framework. Not to provide more fodder for the "framework wars" or to bash on another person's choice. I will always say that the best framework choice for a project is the one you or your team is the most familiar with that will help you be the most productive and provide the fewest tradeoffs for what you want. In fact I love to read other peoples' completely biased articles on why they choose their framework (or library or text editor or whatever) and I enjoy celebrating their success and happiness over what they've chosen, while I enjoy what I've chosen. If there's anyone else out there like me who chooses Angular for their side projects, I'd love to chat in the comments about what your reasons are! And if you want to bash Angular or another framework for it not being as good as Framework X or Y, I humbly request you save those comments for the posts that encourage it. ❤🌈&lt;/p&gt;
