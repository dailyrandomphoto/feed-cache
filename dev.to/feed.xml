      <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing is often seen as a destructive activity. Spotting and reporting failures may be regarded as criticism against the product and against the author. I, as a software tester, am the bearer of the &lt;em&gt;bad news&lt;/em&gt;. We are the messengers of undesired revelations about issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is important. It considerably contributes to assuring that the application does everything that it was designed for. Looking for defects requires curiosity, attention to detail and professional pessimism. You probably want to know as soon as possible that something is wrong with your product. Defects found during testing will save time and money later. Win-win!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use Visme to Help Your Desing Projects Stand Out</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc/how-to-use-visme-to-help-your-desing-projects-stand-out-2hj0</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published September 28, 2019 on BritishPandaChick Codes. I made tweaks to the original post so it works for The Practical Dev.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 11, I was tagged in a Twitter thread where developers were sharing their 5 favorite tools or apps they couldn't live without then tagging more developers so the list of resources would continue to grow. My tweet listed five things I regularly use when I code or blog. My 5 favorite tools are Google, Twitter, Github, CodePen, and Canva.&lt;/p&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;You've already seen CodePen here on some of the code tutorial posts. Github is online platform developers use to host their code on the web. Canva is an online graphic design tool. I regularly use Canva to create banners and logos for websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this tweet was published, I went on with the rest of my day. A few days later, Visme sent me an e-mail about the tweet I posted. They asked me if they knew about their design tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked me to take a closer look at their tool and play around with it so I could share it with you here. Visme gave me a complimentary premium account to use for this review. I started playing around with Visme once I finished the Skillcrush 300 series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around with the tool and making some projects, here's my official guide I promised for Visme. This post will show you how to use Visme to create your own design projects such as the blog graphic I made for today's post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Visme?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visme is a data presentation and visualization tool that allows users to make a variety of visual content. Users can use the platform to create different professional graphics and presentations. Think of this tool as a mix of Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe Photoshop, and Google Drive. You can learn more about Visme from this video on their YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpYosGCV9vI"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How much does Visme cost?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this post, you can buy Visme as an individual, school, or business. You can pay per month or yearly. Individual basic membership is completely free. You’ll be limited with the number of projects, storage, and templates but you’ll still be able to get the main benefits from Visme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individual standard plan is $14 a month. You get more storage and projects you can keep on the platform. Other perks include creating color palettes, downloading projects as PDFs, and no Visme brand on projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individual complete membership is $25 a month. Members get the full benefits of the platform including privacy controls, slide library, and downloading as HTML code.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to use Visme for your business or at your school? Visme offers standard and complete packages for businesses and schools. A business single package is $25 a month while an education single package is $30 a semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contact the customer service team to learn more. If you would like to learn more about Visme's pricing, head to the Visme website and see how they break down their prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.visme.co/"&gt;==&amp;gt; Click here to learn more about Visme!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So how do I use Visme?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make a Visme account by creating your own username and password. Users can also use their Google or Facebook accounts to login. Once you login, you will be taken straight to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the dashboard beside the help icon and the bell for notifications, you will see your account name and e-mail. If you click on this, it will open to a sub-menu with the account type and account number. You will want to keep note of this in case you need to contact Visme customer service and discuss your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1RLa8Wwo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51135118040_2988b6efaa_m.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1RLa8Wwo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51135118040_2988b6efaa_m.jpg" alt="Visme Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you login to Visme, you'll see all the projects you made here. You can also see these projects in all projects or my projects on the black sidebar navigation menu. Other things you can see on the sidebar menu are share with me, slide library, and my folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share with me is where you can see projects others have shared with you. Slide library is where you can find all the slides you have saved for future presentations. Then My Folders is where you can make or see folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the sidebar is the trash, my brand, analytics, and form results. Trash is where you find all the projects you've deleted. My brand is where you'll be able to save your brand information such as fonts, color palette, logos, and templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytics is where you will be able to track users visiting your published projects and download this data. Form result is where you can find data from any forms you make. Like the analytics, you can download this information too if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let's create a brand new project!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a brand new project in two ways. You can click the button in the main dashboard window at the bottom of the create button at the top of the black sidebar menu. Once you click the create button, you will be taken to a page to decide which project you will make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the page, you will see a black navigation menu with the types of projects you can make. Visme allows users to create presentations, infographics, documents, printables, web graphics, social graphics, and custom size. Custom size allows users to create any size project they would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can set the width and the height of their projects by pixels, inches, or centimeters. You can also select by common sizes such as presentation (16.9), presentation (4.3), US letter, A4, Infographic, and business card. Once you click on a type of project you want to build, the page will show users theme templates Visme has created or a blank project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click on presentations, users can access libraries of ready-use slides Visme has created. Documents, printables, web graphics, and social graphics will have a sub-menu at the top of the page which shows users the different types of projects you can make. So if you would like to make a menu, you can find menu templates by clicking printables then menus in the sub-menu that appears underneath the black navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creating a Pinterest Graphic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the Pinterest graphic. Once I click the social graphics and pick the Pinterest icon, I'm taken straight to the Visme workspace. The image below is what the Visme workspace looks like for almost every project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wod5UlHA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51134227923_8cf19d1029_m.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wod5UlHA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51134227923_8cf19d1029_m.jpg" alt="Visme Canvas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the page is the black navigation bar. You can click on the three bars icon go back to the dashboard, view the options, change settings and modify your canvas size. Besides the three bars icon, you'll find the save, undo, help, and project name. You can click on the project name to change it to anything you like. I changed mine to sample-pinterest for this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's start with the left side of the workspace. The left navigation bar is where you'll find everything you need to make any project. Here you'll find layouts, basics, graphics, data, media, theme colors, and my files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you click on each of these icons on the navigation bar, a window will open up to show samples and different content you can use to create your designs. Some of these items will give you ones Visme provides but you still are able to add your own items for your design. I'm going to start by adding text to my blog graphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I add text to my Visme canvas, a menu bar will appear for the text. This is where you can change the fonts, colors, font size, and more. You can add effects, animation, or arrange the text on the canvas. You can even turn your text into a link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you add items to the canvas, Visme will show you a preview of your project on the right side of the screen. You can also click the preview button at the top right navigation menu to preview your project up closer. If you would like to add more pages, you can press the add page icon at the top of the right window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are working on your project and what to edit on the text, you click on the text you want to change to get the text menu. Clicking the text once will give you the following menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--96j260-E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51134009226_c331946322_m.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--96j260-E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51134009226_c331946322_m.jpg" alt="Text Menu at the top of the Visme canvas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This menu allows users to change the text by adding the following to a text box.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;spacing&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;fill&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;border&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;special characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alignment&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the menu gives you similar items that were in the original text menu such as effect, animate and duplicate. If you double-check on the menu, you will be able to change the fonts, font size, and colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to add a line in between my logo and graphic text. In order to add shapes, I'm going to click on the graphics icon on the left menu and click lines. I just picked the line I wanted and double-click it to have it appear on the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I just need to move the line and change the line size by clicking on the black dots that appear when I click on the line. If you click on the line, you can open up the icon menu to change the color, thickness or flip the icon vertically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ready to publish?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time to think about how you want to publish it. Now that you are satisfied with your project, you can publish it. I'm going to download my Pinterest graphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, I just need to click on the download button on the top right of the black navigation bar. When I click the button, a window opens with several options. These options include downloading the project as an image,  document, or HTML5 file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visme gives users two options for image and document. You can download the project as a JPG or a PNG file. Visme gives users the option to download the image as a high resolution at the top so just switch the button if you want a high-resolution image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SFaw5qCR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51134248833_ca4cb80a5f_m.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SFaw5qCR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51134248833_ca4cb80a5f_m.jpg" alt="How to Use Visme to Help Your Design Projects Stand Out"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to download it as a document, you choose between the PDF or PPTX.  PDF files have a button that users can click to show bleed marks. Bleed marks just show the areas that need to be trimmed after the project is printed. So if you want your project professionally printed, you can turn the bleed marks on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visme encourages users to use HTML5 if they plan on using any animations or effects since this file type will preserve all these so you can use them offline. They even include a gear icon for advanced settings for HTML5 files so you can change the page design, display options, social/engagement, and audio controls I am going to click the PNG image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I click the PNG option, my design project is generated and the project is downloaded to my computer. If it doesn't automatically download, you might get a window saying that you've been chosen to open your Visme file from the Visme website. It will ask what you want to do with this file from opening it or saving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sharing Projects Online&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to share your project online, click the share button on the black navigation bar. This opens a window with three options. First, you can publish it on the web and get a shareable link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also allow Google to index your project. You can share your project privately. Two, you can share your project privately and allow certain people access to your project. Third, you can embed your projects on your website or blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top right corner of the share online window, you'll see the gear for advanced settings. Advanced settings are where you want to change page design, display options, audio controls, and social/engagement. You can change any of these settings for any of the share online options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is everything you need to know to start making design projects on Visme. If you need any help using the Visme workspace, Visme has tons of great ways to help you with your projects. You can get tips from the Visme blog. There are tons of great posts on their blog for creating awesome Visme designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the Help icon on your Visme dashboard to find more guides and tutorials. You can also e-mail the Visme customer service team with any questions. Once you've made a Visme account, you can register for one of the free webinars Visme hosts every Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each webinar has the Visme team walking viewers through the Visme tool and answer any questions live on the webinar you might have. You can ask the customer service team for a webinar link if you would like to attend the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you used Visme before? Share your experience with the Visme tool in the comments. You can also share any design tips you have in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Would you use a webapp to search linux commands</title>
      <author>Vivek</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 21:16:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/vivekweb2013/would-you-use-a-webapp-to-search-linux-commands-26kl</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/vivekweb2013/would-you-use-a-webapp-to-search-linux-commands-26kl</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you remember the options and flags supported by a specific linux command, do you use search engine every time to look for the supported options and flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have some commands with lots of options which might take too long to type. Do you store such commands for reusing them? where do you store them? maybe in notes app or some text documents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vqFibUWM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dvuqzir6gghf3k4t9xpm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vqFibUWM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dvuqzir6gghf3k4t9xpm.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you use a free web application to store the commands for you privately. Try a free webapp I've developed to give back to community which has gave me so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://commandhunt.com"&gt;https://commandhunt.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's completely free, allows copying a command with a single click, generate the commands using nicely designed user interface (by selecting required flags and filling necessary values for required options).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your valued feedback is much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Top 10 best extensions for VScode - #1</title>
      <author>Francisco</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 21:01:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/franciscode/top-10-best-extensions-for-vscode-1-414l</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/franciscode/top-10-best-extensions-for-vscode-1-414l</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody! This is my first post in English, today we will see the 10 best extensions for Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSCode extensions serve to speed up certain tasks that can take away valuable seconds in our work, that's why the community of this code editor has created several tools for its useful operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I bring you, my top 10 extensions for Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we start Visual Studio Code we will have what we should be used to, that's right, the typical welcome screen in every code editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--axaARdJb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qztcpi4trwmifpl72vmb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--axaARdJb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qztcpi4trwmifpl72vmb.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we will have to go to the extensions box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ab5Gytrx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dyv5pe1uyj6acrx1yp0r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ab5Gytrx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dyv5pe1uyj6acrx1yp0r.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we only need to look for the following extensions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prettier"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prettier
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E_hGTB76--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4vgxjx4ifaw2seoe6pc8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E_hGTB76--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4vgxjx4ifaw2seoe6pc8.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simply search for its name in the text box, and select the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will click on install&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OZf83Of---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ucl0j37j8qel20jk1xp2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OZf83Of---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ucl0j37j8qel20jk1xp2.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this extension do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is used to format the document, in other words to tidy it up and clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it we will simply have to be in the file in which we want to clean it, for example this very, very messy HTML file 😂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BxYF6pHF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/confeiojvuopfjvppmej.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BxYF6pHF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/confeiojvuopfjvppmej.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the extension press the following key combination:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Shift + P&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And type Format Document and press Enter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dwBaZJnQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8o6mwtiv65kjrl4iuakz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dwBaZJnQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8o6mwtiv65kjrl4iuakz.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or simply &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shift + Alt + F&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with this we will have our code in order!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#live-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Live Server
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sfm-4zyS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qx3t1dvvjp21hdxkga5f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sfm-4zyS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qx3t1dvvjp21hdxkga5f.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous extension, simply click on install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#usage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Usage
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it, simply type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Shift + P&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And type Live server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QohgOw13--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3q7fabxbsrsrikno5qae.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QohgOw13--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3q7fabxbsrsrikno5qae.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the one that says &lt;strong&gt;"Open with live Server"&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to make it shorter, we will make the following combination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Alt + L + O&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will open our default browser and give us a view of our HTML file, this extension allows us to simply save the files with VSCode with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + S&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the changes will already be in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#material-icon-theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Material Icon Theme
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--woqZ6h1M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3znfo5hp8ubfs318ljo8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--woqZ6h1M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3znfo5hp8ubfs318ljo8.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension will give us a wide variety of icons for a wide variety of files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1LibXKwc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmh2w1kykx1zc0or4muh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1LibXKwc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmh2w1kykx1zc0or4muh.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the previous ones, we will look for it by its name and click on install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once installed, the following window will appear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hhA0opL1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xer0t1x2jec12j90ye2i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hhA0opL1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xer0t1x2jec12j90ye2i.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should select the one that says Material Icon Theme&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it! we have new icons for our visual studio code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok ok, we already have 3 extensions, there is still a lot left, but let's not be discouraged!!! We will have our very nice Code Editor at the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indent-rainbow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Indent Rainbow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WFeYw8FC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rblh59epae8ioxi8pdy2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WFeYw8FC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rblh59epae8ioxi8pdy2.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension will help us a lot to order our code, the installation is the same as we have followed before, (The search for it, and simply give the button to install)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is very fast and to check that it is ready we will go to our test file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JdrThvuK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xry3gk868724s7e2e3r2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JdrThvuK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xry3gk868724s7e2e3r2.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see this extension will help us to guide us, to see where a tag or key starts and where it ends.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the following extension will give an excellent essence to our editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#one-monokai-theme"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  One Monokai Theme
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OL9ymktw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3hui3hh2qzpwpr1in6wg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OL9ymktw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3hui3hh2qzpwpr1in6wg.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the One Monokai theme, to install it we must follow the procedure previously discussed and when we install it, the following will appear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aalgtDgz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/84jvkng7dtqjxg1wy3ml.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aalgtDgz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/84jvkng7dtqjxg1wy3ml.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And simply select the option One Monokai&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we go back to our test HTML file it will look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SBtDH342--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6fg2gqkeopt0qamg74sp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SBtDH342--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6fg2gqkeopt0qamg74sp.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well well, then I decided to leave this post until here so as not to extend it too much, and also not to fill the reader with so much information haha.&lt;br&gt;
I hope this post will be very supported as it is my first post in English, thank you very much for reading, remember to leave the Heart, Unicorn and save&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep Programming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple way to transform any Google Sheet to JSON</title>
      <author>Krzysztof Kopieczek</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:53:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/kopieczekdev/simple-way-to-transform-any-google-sheet-to-json-1o74</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/kopieczekdev/simple-way-to-transform-any-google-sheet-to-json-1o74</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Solution is really easy, but with one big drawback - the sheet needs to accessed publicly on the Internet. In my case this is not a permanent feature - I just have to move data from one source to another one, but I would not recommend this solution if you deal with sensitive data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#prepare-the-sheet"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Prepare the sheet
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; Publish to the web&lt;/strong&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;Entire Document &amp;gt; Web Page&lt;/strong&gt;. That's all here, just close the window. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qd75C4Sd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y7n6dszibuh8j3osy76b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qd75C4Sd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y7n6dszibuh8j3osy76b.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, copy the sheet id from the URL in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-saviour"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The saviour
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gsx2json.com"&gt;gsx2json&lt;/a&gt; is a tool which does all the magic for us. Please go to the project website and buy a coffee to the author if it helped you. It saved me a ton of time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-the-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get the data
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use C# but the code is quite simple. Just create the url with the sheet id and get the JSON.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// using System.Net;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sheetId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"1zpss4g850wpb9YltdzefCyvl2Vl4gDZ-Ip4Hk-dQjOk"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;$"http://gsx2json.com/api?id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sheetId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;WebClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;DownloadStringTaskAsync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;uri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="http://gsx2json.com/api?id=1zpss4g850wpb9YltdzefCyvl2Vl4gDZ-Ip4Hk-dQjOk"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the API if you'd like to review the JSON created by gsx2json.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#transform-the-data"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Transform the data
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you got the data, do whatever it has to be done. Here is an example of extracting rows from the JSON response.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight csharp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;JObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"rows"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;players&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ToObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Player&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;]&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cleaning-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cleaning up
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to unpublish the sheet from the Internet. And that's all!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Escreva um JavaScript mais limpo com Operador Optional Chaining [Tradução pt-BR]</title>
      <author>Adriana Lima Shikasho</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:49:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dxwebster/escreva-um-javascript-mais-limpo-com-operador-optional-chaining-traducao-pt-br-4gia</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dxwebster/escreva-um-javascript-mais-limpo-com-operador-optional-chaining-traducao-pt-br-4gia</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#artigo-traduzido-e-adaptado-do-original-javascript-optional-chaining-por-kyle-cook-acessar"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Artigo traduzido e adaptado do original "JavaScript Optional Chaining" por Kyle Cook. &lt;a href="https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2020-03/javascript-optional-chaining/"&gt;Acessar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se você trabalha com JavaScript há um tempo, você provavelmente já se deparou com um código parecido com esse:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O código acima acaba não sendo a forma mais concisa ou limpa de verificar se um objeto é undefined ou null antes de acessar suas propriedades. Por essse motivo, o JavaScript finalmente nos trouxe o operador &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#o-que-%C3%A9-optional-chaining"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  O que é Optional Chaining
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se você tem usado outra linguagem além do JavaScript você provavelmente está familiarizado com o &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; pelo fato da maioria das linguagens darem suporte a ele. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basicamente, a ideia do &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; é facilitar a escrita de um código da qual você precisa acessar as propriedades ou valores que estão aninhados dentro do objeto ou de um array, e que podem ou não ser null/undefined. Vamos olhar a sintaxe básica do &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; para entender exatamente como isso funciona.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No código acima temos a variável &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; que pode ou não ser null/undefined. Pelo fato de não sabermos se &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; está definida, não podemos acessar diretamente a propriedade &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; tendo em vista que se &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; for undefined nós teremos o seguinte erro:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Usando o operador &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;), podemos escrever nosso  código e acessar diretamente o &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;. Se &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; for undefined, nosso código vai simplesmente retornar undefined ao invés de um erro. O código acima é o mesmo que o código seguinte:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O operador &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; está verificando a variável &lt;code&gt;person&lt;/code&gt; para garantir que esteja definida antes dde acessar a propriedade &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; e se não for definida vai retornar undefined. Como exemplo, se quisermos pegar a rua do endereço, ficaria da seguinte forma:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;street&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Esse código é muito mais fácil de ler do que o código original e é um dos melhores exemplos de uso do &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt;. O JavaScript possui diversos usos adicionais para o optional chaining que a maioria das outras linguagens não implementam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optional-chaining-em-functions"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optional Chaining em Functions
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O primeiro grande exemplo de uso adicional do &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; é nas chamadas de funções. Vamos olhar um código que descreve uma função de um objeto que pode ou não estar definido.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;windowCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;house&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWindowCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;house&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWindowCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Esse código está basicamente verificando a variável &lt;code&gt;house&lt;/code&gt; para garantir que a propriedade &lt;code&gt;getWindowCount&lt;/code&gt; existe antes de tentar chamar a função. É nesse código desajeitado e difícil de ler, que o optional chaining irá entrar em ação.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;windowCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;house&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getWindowCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Logo de cara pode parecer estranho ter um ponto final (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) antes  o parêntesis da função, mas isso  é porque o &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; é  um ponto de interrogação seguido por um ponto final, não apenas um ponto de interrogação.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esse novo código que usa o &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; vai agora verificar se existe a função &lt;code&gt;getWindowCount&lt;/code&gt; definida na variável &lt;code&gt;house&lt;/code&gt; e, se existir, chamá-la. Se a função não existir na variável &lt;code&gt;house&lt;/code&gt; então irá retornar undefined ao invés de chamar a função.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essa habilidade do &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; nas funções é algo que outras linguagens não implementam e é realmente útil, especialmente em JavaScript, uma vez que functions são usadas em todos os lugares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#optional-chaining-em-arrays"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Optional Chaining em Arrays
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O último principal modo que o &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; pode ser usado é nos arrays. Se você deseja acessar um elemento no array pelo index, mas não tem certeza se o array está definido, então você vai precisar usar um código parecido com esse:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Usando o operador &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; esse código pode ser simplificado para o seguinte:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;firstElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Novamente pode parecer estranho o ponto final antes dos colchetes que acessam o elemento do array, mas faz parte da sintaxe do operador &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt;. Esse novo código vai funcionar primeiramente verificando se a var &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; está definida e se sim, irá tentar acessar o index especificado. Se a var &lt;code&gt;arr&lt;/code&gt; não estiver definida, irá retornar undefined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essa notação de colchetes com &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; pode ser usada em objetos também.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Isso é realmente útil se você deseja acessar dinamicamente as propriedades de um objeto com base em uma string e não tem certeza se o objeto está definido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#suporte-para-navegador"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Suporte para navegador
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Com todos esses excelentes novos recursos do JavaScript, a maior preocupação é o suporte do navegador. Infelizmente, o &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; tem muito pouco suporte fora dos navegadores mais recentes. No momento em que este artigo foi escrito, o &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; tinha suporte de apenas 45% em todos os navegadores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felizmente, porém, você ainda pode usar esse operador usando ferramentas como o babel para transpilar seu código JavaScript para que navegadores mais antigos possam entendê-lo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclus%C3%A3o"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusão
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O operador &lt;em&gt;optional chaining&lt;/em&gt; é algo que a maioria das outras linguagens tiveram o luxo de usar por anos, mas só agora está sendo introduzido no JavaScript. Isso significa que a maioria dos navegadores ainda não implementaram esse recurso, mas com o poder de ferramentas como o Babel por exemplo, esse recurso pode ser usado hoje em dia, sem a necessidade de se preocupar com o suporte do navegador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu recomendo fortemente o uso deste operador em todos os seus novos projetos que possuem o Babel, pois ele tornará a escrita do JavaScript mais limpa e mais fácil.&lt;/p&gt;

  Introduction &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One data structure that many other complex ones build off of is the humble array. Therefore, it’s important to have a strong foundational understanding and knowledge of arrays before diving into other data structures. In this post we will cover what arrays are, how to create them, and 20 methods ranging from ones you will commonly use, some that are a bit more complex (mainly because of callback functions), and some fun ones to know as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you go, if you’re interested in learning more data structures and want another resource for algorithms, check out the series Megan Lo and I are collaborating on! The series will focus on data structures and algorithms, and our first post covers the crossover of Strings and Arrays. If you need a refresher on Strings, check out her post &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mehmehmehlol/when-to-use-these-string-methods-in-javascript-3m4h"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise visit our &lt;a href="https://dev.to/wlcreate/all-about-javascript-arrays-array-methods-4ek4"&gt;collab&lt;/a&gt; and stay tuned for more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let’s dive into the wonderful world of arrays!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Since this is a very long post, feel free to skip around as you like 😉&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-are-arrays"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What are arrays? &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to MDN, JavaScript arrays are “list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations”. In other words, arrays organize their items sequentially and have built-in methods that allow you to easily lookup and add/remove information based on its position. Array positions, also known as indexes, start at zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact&lt;/em&gt;: Unlike non-scripting languages like Java, C, or C++, JavaScript (as a scripted language) does not have static arrays where you need to specify in advance how many elements you plan to store because they have a fixed size. Instead, JavaScript arrays are dynamic, meaning the size of it will grow or shrink as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun Fact&lt;/em&gt;: Arrays are a special type of object! That said, the array’s object properties are kept separate from its elements and the methods you would use on the array’s elements cannot be used on its object properties. To set or access the array’s object property collection, you need to use bracket or dot notation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// “object”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// “object”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays have fast lookups of O(1) time because you can simply retrieve an element based on its given index, no matter how large the size of the array is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is time expensive O(n)  to insert or delete from an array because it requires the other elements to “scoot” over to make room or fill the gap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-we-create-arrays"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do we create arrays? &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially there are two ways to create an array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the array literal
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;literalEmptyArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;literalFilledArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the new constructor
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;constructorEmptyArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;constructorFilledArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That said, a third way to create an array is the &lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt; method! Essentially the &lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt; method creates a new Array instance from the passed in number of arguments, regardless of number or type of the arguments. The difference between the &lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt; method and &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; constructor is what they do with the arguments; &lt;code&gt;Array.of(7)&lt;/code&gt; creates an array with a single element, 7, whereas &lt;code&gt;Array(7)&lt;/code&gt; creates an empty array with a length property of 7 (Note: this implies an array of 7 empty slots, not slots with actual undefined values)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [1]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [undefined]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Methods &lt;a&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going into some of the numerous (I roughly estimate more than 35) methods that arrays have, let’s first review what it means for something to be destructive vs non-destructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destructive&lt;/em&gt;: The action mutates the original array, meaning that once you perform the action on the original array, you will not be able to have the original’s information again. Rather, the original has become updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Non-destructive&lt;/em&gt;: The action does not mutate the original array, meaning that once you perform the action on the original array, you will have the original’s information. Therefore, you will be able to have both the original and updated information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and being aware of when a method is destructive vs non-destructive is important when you will ultimately need to decide which method to use. Now, let’s take a look at some &lt;a href="#basic-methods"&gt;basic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="#advanced-methods"&gt;advanced&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="#fun-methods"&gt;fun&lt;/a&gt; methods!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basic Methods &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods we will be covering are: &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unshift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt;. To demonstrate each method, the base array &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we will be referring to is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;iceCream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;vanilla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;chocolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strawberry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;tea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 4 most common use cases for methods on an array is to destructively add or remove an element from the beginning or end of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you can't see the image below, here's a summary of the methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Add an item to the end of an Array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Remove an item from the end of an Array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;unshift&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Add an item to the beginning of an Array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;shift&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Remove an item from the beginning of an Array&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ku7bD4VX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4g841pk0jc1v8ang6oed.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ku7bD4VX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4g841pk0jc1v8ang6oed.png" alt="basic-destructive-methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other common cases are copying or removing a section of the array. While they have similar names, these methods are &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt; and it's important to remember whether or not you want the action to be destructive or non-destructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-splice-endraw-remove-an-item-by-index-position-destructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt;: Remove an item by index position (destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt;, you must pass in what index you want to start removing items from (inclusive). You can optionally include a second argument index to say where you want to stop removing items from (inclusive), however if you don’t the method will automatically remove to the end.  Additionally, starting from the third argument, any that you include will be elements added to the array, beginning from start (first argument). If you do not specify any elements, &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt; will only remove elements from the array. That said, if no arguments at all are passed in, the return value will be an empty array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// general&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// including the optional parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;endIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don't forget the &lt;a href="#original-basic-array"&gt;original array&lt;/a&gt; for the following example!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xKUd5FpQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ay1g79rufdmej02uunhu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xKUd5FpQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ay1g79rufdmej02uunhu.png" alt="splice-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-slice-endraw-copy-an-array-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt;: Copy an Array (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you simply want to make a copy of an array you do not need to pass in any arguments. That said, you do have the option to include the starting index (inclusive) and ending index (non-inclusive) to copy from. This method is often used over &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt; because it avoids the “side-effect” of mutating the original array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not pass in any arguments, by default the entire original array will be copied. If either index is negative, it extracts starting from the end or last element (&lt;code&gt;Array.length&lt;/code&gt; - index). On the other hand, if the arguments you pass in are larger than the actual array (for example, an array with 5 elements but passing in arguments to start at 10 and end at 50) the return value will be an empty array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// general&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// including the optional parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;slice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;startIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;endIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don't forget the &lt;a href="#original-basic-array"&gt;original array&lt;/a&gt; for the following example!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---9PWkyw5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cjxyucp8qh6vlj50ovjg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---9PWkyw5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cjxyucp8qh6vlj50ovjg.png" alt="slice-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#advanced-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Advanced Methods &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods we will be covering in this section are: &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt;. Before continuing on, it’s important to know that many of the methods have the same parameters; in this case &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of repeating it each time, I’ll leave the explanation of the parameters up here for you to refer to! &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three arguments you can pass into the callback function, two of them being optional. The one argument you must pass in is the current value, which represents the current element being processed. The other two arguments are the index of the current element and array the method was called upon. Besides the callback function, you can also use the &lt;code&gt;thisArg&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which is the value to use as &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; when executing the callback. However, if the callback uses an arrow function the &lt;code&gt;thisArg&lt;/code&gt; can be omitted because all arrow functions lexically bind the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-reduce-endraw-reduce-to-a-single-value-destructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;: Reduce to a single value (destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the reduce method takes in a callback function that executes the callback on each element of the array, resulting in single output value. The callback (reducer) function you provide must at the very least include two parameters: the accumulator and current value. The accumulator accumulates callback's return values; in other words, it is the accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback On the hand, the current value is the value currently being processed in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally, the reduce method can take in a second argument that will represent the initialValue. This value is what the accumulator will start as if it is passed in. Additionally, the callback can take in other parameters for the index and array, which represent the index of the current element being processed and the array the reduce method was called on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentValue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rFiPDJIm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lb03s75386jtjqpiknmz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rFiPDJIm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lb03s75386jtjqpiknmz.png" alt="reduce-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-sort-endraw-sorts-the-elements-destructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;: Sorts the elements (destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When calling this method on the array it will sort it in place and return the sorted version. By default the elements will be sorted in &lt;strong&gt;ascending&lt;/strong&gt; order by converting the elements to strings and then comparing their Unicode code points. It’s important to know how they are sorted because in a numeric sort, 9 comes before 80, but because numbers are converted to strings, "80" comes before "9" in the Unicode order. Something important to note, all undefined elements are sorted to the end of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally, and if you want to be more specific on how to sort (i.e. for integers), you can pass in a callback (compare) function that compares two arguments; the first and second element, often referred to as &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;, to each other. Under the hood, if the callback function returns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less than 0, it means that the current order is correct; the first element will remain before the second element (&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; will still come before &lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0, it means that the elements are equal to each other; the order will remain the same with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;greater than 0, it means that the current order is incorrect; the second element will be before the first element (&lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt; before &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// including the optional parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W8u6CsOv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sabheybbo9vb35vrd87x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W8u6CsOv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sabheybbo9vb35vrd87x.png" alt="sort-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-concat-endraw-merge-arrays-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;: Merge arrays (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is used to merge two or more arrays, returning a new array without mutating the originals. To be more specific, the new array has all of the elements of the array it is called on, followed in order by, for each argument, the elements of the argument or the argument itself. However, if an argument is a nested array it will not take the nested array out, rather it will only remove it from the array it is in (one-level deep)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun Fact&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; copies the object references of the original into the new array so that both the original and new array refer to the same object! Therefore, if a referenced object is modified, the changes are visible to both the new and original arrays.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Array1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Array2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pWVrpFiS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c9oltljr4kpp1vt43orz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pWVrpFiS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c9oltljr4kpp1vt43orz.png" alt="concat-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-flat-endraw-creates-a-new-array-with-the-subarray-elements-concatenated-into-it-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;flat&lt;/code&gt;: Creates a new array with the sub-array elements concatenated into it (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building off of the &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; method, the &lt;code&gt;flat&lt;/code&gt; method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth. For a single level array, this accomplishes that same thing as the &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; method calling upon the &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; method on its accumulator. On the other hand, to enable deep level flatten without the flat method, you can use recursion with reduce and concat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not required, you can optionally pass in an argument that specifies how deep a nested array structure should be flattened. By default this argument is 1, for a single level array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// including the optional parameters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;flat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t2wJrI0O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r7y5i0ymullgri0co4x1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t2wJrI0O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r7y5i0ymullgri0co4x1.png" alt="flat-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-filter-endraw-returns-all-the-elements-that-pass-the-test-function-provided-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;: Returns all the elements that pass the test function provided (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method creates a new array with all the elements that pass a callback (test) function. As it tests each element of the array it is called on, it returns a value that coerces to true to keep the element, or to false otherwise. When the value is false, it essentially skips over the element and does not include it in the array. If nothing passes the test, an empty array is returned. For more information on the parameters for this function, skip back to the &lt;a href="#callback-information"&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the Advanced Methods section!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-join-endraw-join-all-the-elements-from-an-array-to-a-string-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;: Join all the elements from an array to a string (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; creates and returns a string by concatenating, or joining, all of the elements of the array it was called on. By default the elements are separated by commas, however you can specify what you want to join/separate the elements by. On the other hand, if there is only one element in the array, the single item will be returned as a string without separators, and if there are no elements, an empty string is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, including an argument for the separator parameter is optional if you want the elements to be joined with a comma. Passing in an empty string as the argument will result in the elements joined without any characters/separators. Otherwise, the parameter is what you want to separate each pair of adjacent elements of the array for the returned string. If necessary, the separator is converted to a string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-map-endraw-creates-a-new-array-with-the-results-of-a-callback-function-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;: Creates a new array with the results of a callback function (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; takes in a callback function that is called once for every element of the array it is called on. Each time the callback is executed, it returns the value into the new array, which is returned at the end. That said, if you do not use the returned (new) array and/or do not return a value from the callback, using the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; method is considered anti-pattern. Instead you should use the &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt; method or a for loop. For more information on the parameters for this function, skip back to the &lt;a href="#callback-information"&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the Advanced Methods section!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4oD4u56o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2fmnuxv2owhi63zj34aw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4oD4u56o--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2fmnuxv2owhi63zj34aw.png" alt="map-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-find-endraw-return-the-value-of-the-first-element-that-satisfies-the-provided-function-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;: Return the value of the first element that satisfies the provided function (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; method only returns the first value of the element that satisfies the callback (test) function. If no element passes the test, the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; method will return undefined. That said, if you want to return the index of the element instead of its value, you can use the &lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt; method instead. For more information on the parameters for this function, skip back to the &lt;a href="#callback-information"&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the Advanced Methods section!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qptT1Fr7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/37yuxx94yfgt36eqtt04.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qptT1Fr7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/37yuxx94yfgt36eqtt04.png" alt="find-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-foreach-endraw-loop-over-an-array-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt;: Loop over an Array (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop, &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt; executes a callback function once for each element in the array. While the &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt; method will not mutate the array it was called on, it is possible for the callback function to mutate it. That said, the &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt; method expects a synchronous function, always returns undefined, and is not chainable. Therefore, the typical use case is to execute side effects at the end of a chain. For more information on the parameters for this function, skip back to the &lt;a href="#callback-information"&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the Advanced Methods section!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MLxop8x5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zl9q1aysk5miay5cfa58.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MLxop8x5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zl9q1aysk5miay5cfa58.png" alt="forEach-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fun-methods"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Fun Methods &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, time for some “fun” methods! The methods we will cover here are: &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;indexOf&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-tostring-endraw-returns-a-string-representing-the-array-and-its-elements-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt;: Returns a string representing the array and its elements (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its name, the &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method turns the array’s elements it was called on to a string. To be more specific, this method joins the array and returns one string containing each array element separated by commas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact&lt;/em&gt;: JavaScript calls the &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt; method automatically when an array is to be represented as a text value or when an array is referred to in a string concatenation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xYwWM5Uf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ni7jbhep0wlnzk4oi9id.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xYwWM5Uf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ni7jbhep0wlnzk4oi9id.png" alt="toString-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-includes-endraw-returns-a-boolean-if-a-value-exists-in-an-array-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt;: Returns a boolean if a value exists in an array (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt; determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate. It does this by checking each element for equality with the value rather than using a testing callback function. That said, if you need to find if any element satisfies a provided testing callback function, you can use the some method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument you must pass in is the value you want the method to search for; keep in mind when comparing strings and characters, &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt; is case-sensitive. The optional second argument is the index to start searching for the value and by default is zero. That said, if the index passed in is greater than or equal to the length of the array, false is returned and the array will not be searched. On the other hand, if the index is negative the method uses the absolute value of it as the number of elements from the end of the array at which to start the search&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VO03s7zs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u6js5a1t1r7jqndvav2m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VO03s7zs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u6js5a1t1r7jqndvav2m.png" alt="includes-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-fill-endraw-fills-all-the-elements-of-an-array-with-a-static-value-destructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt;: Fills all the elements of an array with a static value (destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; method changes all elements in an array to a static value, from a start index to an end index. It then returns the modified array with the filled values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three parameters however only the first one is required. The first argument you must pass in is the value to fill the array with. It’s important to know that all of the elements in the array will be this exact value. The other two optional parameters are for the start index, default is zero, and the end index, default is array.length.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;staticValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JzV5wdtq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qlvxejp8xxif5jndal1c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JzV5wdtq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qlvxejp8xxif5jndal1c.png" alt="fill-method"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexof-amp-findindex-find-the-index-of-an-item-in-the-array-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  indexOf &amp;amp; findIndex: Find the index of an item in the Array (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to each other in that both return the first index that satisfies a condition. However, while &lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt; is based on the element that satisfies a testing callback function, &lt;code&gt;indexOf&lt;/code&gt; checks each element for equality with the value. Additionally, -1 is returned by &lt;code&gt;indexOf&lt;/code&gt; if the element you are searching for is not present, whereas -1 is returned by &lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt; if nothing satisfies the callback. That said, if you need to find if any element satisfies the provided testing function, you can use the some method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt; has the same parameters detailed in the &lt;a href="#callback-information"&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of the Advanced Methods section. On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;indexOf&lt;/code&gt; takes in an argument for the element to search for and optionally the index to start searching for. If you include the second argument of the index to start searching and the index is greater than or equal to the array's length, -1 is returned, which means the array will not be searched.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;searchValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;startIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;findIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// do something&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DUkpogad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfrprhjctbudkz0l38ut.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DUkpogad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfrprhjctbudkz0l38ut.png" alt="indexOf-findIndex-methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! I declare you “master of JavaScript arrays and (most) array methods”! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/12Lt1KWHowKtKo/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/12Lt1KWHowKtKo/giphy.gif" alt="diploma"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously though, this was a lot of information and I hope you’ll be able to refer to it in the future! Here are some key takeaways, as well as a reminder of what methods we covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays organize their items sequentially and have built-in methods that allow you to easily lookup and add/remove information based on its position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript arrays are special type of object and unlike non-scripting languages, are dynamic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create arrays you can use the array literal, new constructor, or of method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, you can copy, concatenate arrays, and convert a string into an array by using the spread operator &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#basic-methods"&gt;Basic methods&lt;/a&gt; about adding, removing, or copying an array: &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unshift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;splice&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#advanced-methods"&gt;Advanced methods&lt;/a&gt; to merge: &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#advanced-methods"&gt;Advanced methods&lt;/a&gt; do something based on a callback: &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#fun-methods"&gt;Fun methods&lt;/a&gt; that have to do with the value or index: &lt;code&gt;includes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;indexOf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#fun-methods"&gt;Fun methods&lt;/a&gt; to know: &lt;code&gt;toString&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resources &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array"&gt;All array methods&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.interviewcake.com"&gt;Interview Cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Fixing the node-sass problem in Rails - node downgrade helps</title>
      <author>Andrzej Krzywda</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:42:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/andrzejkrzywda/fixing-the-node-sass-problem-in-rails-node-downgrade-helps-16lh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/andrzejkrzywda/fixing-the-node-sass-problem-in-rails-node-downgrade-helps-16lh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I've had one of those irritating problems with Rails that I know one day I will have again. So, future me when you google it, here is the fix, you're welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem shows like this during &lt;code&gt;rails new new_app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node_modules/node-sass: Command failed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1 error generated.
make: *** [Release/obj.target/binding/src/binding.o] Error 1
gyp ERR! build error 
gyp ERR! stack Error: `make` failed with exit code: 2
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onExit (/Users/andrzej/apps/stimulus_infinite_scroll/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/build.js:262:23)
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:365:28)
gyp ERR! stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:290:12)
gyp ERR! System Darwin 19.6.0
gyp ERR! command "/usr/local/Cellar/node/16.0.0/bin/node" "/Users/andrzej/apps/stimulus_infinite_scroll/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js" "rebuild" "--verbose" "--libsass_ext=" "--libsass_cflags=" "--libsass_ldflags=" "--libsass_library="
gyp ERR! cwd /Users/andrzej/apps/stimulus_infinite_scroll/node_modules/node-sass
gyp ERR! node -v v16.0.0
gyp ERR! node-gyp -v v3.8.0
gyp ERR! not ok
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the node version used is &lt;code&gt;16.0.0&lt;/code&gt;. At the moment of writing this post, it's a relatively new version and not everything works fine with this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution? Downgrade node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case I did:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g n
sudo n 14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and that's it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible alternative:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew remove node
brew install node@14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If this helped you, let me know in the comments, so that I believe in value of such posts even more ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! &lt;br&gt;

This is Waverley and Megan! We are both tech enthusiasts and graduated from Flatiron School recently. Both of us enjoy writing blogs to help other programmers learn and we learn from writing as well (win-win!). This will be our first time writing blogs on dev.to and collaborating on a series with each other, and we are so excited to create content for you all! &lt;strong&gt;Feedback is appreciated as we continue to navigate this process&lt;/strong&gt; 🙏 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first decided to collaborate we came up with a lot of topics to write about. However, as we are both currently in our job search and as bootcamp graduates, we wanted to work on something that will help us now and others in the future. Ultimately, we decided to have this series focus on data structures and algorithms, something we both feel is important to know but not exactly the easiest to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, check out our Medium blogs for more of our work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to talk about converting array to string, and vice versa. This is one of the commonly seen strategies that is used when solving string-and-array-related coding questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, if you are interested in knowing array methods, here's &lt;a href="https://dev.to/wlcreate/everything-javascript-arrays-array-methods-14om"&gt;Everything JavaScript Arrays &amp;amp; Array Methods!&lt;/a&gt; by Waverley; and for string methods, here's &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mehmehmehlol/when-to-use-these-string-methods-in-javascript-3m4h"&gt;When to Use these String Methods in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; by Megan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#object-assign"&gt;Object.assign([], string)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#spread-operator"&gt;Spread Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-array-to-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From Array to String &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that we often need to do is convert an array to a string. Thankfully JavaScript has two built-in methods to accomplish this: &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-tostring-endraw-returns-a-string-representing-the-array-and-its-elements-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt;: Returns a string representing the array and its elements (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its name, the &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method turns the array’s elements it was called on to a string. To be more specific, this method joins the array and returns one string containing each array element separated by commas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact&lt;/em&gt;: JavaScript calls the toString method automatically when an array is to be represented as a text value or when an array is referred to in a string concatenation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "1,2,a,1a"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-join-endraw-join-all-the-elements-from-an-array-to-a-string-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;: Join all the elements from an array to a string (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; creates and returns a string by concatenating, or joining, all of the elements of the array it was called on. By default the elements are separated by commas, however you can specify what you want to join/separate the elements by. On the other hand, if there is only one element in the array, the single item will be returned as a string without separators, and if there are no elements, an empty string is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, including an argument for the separator parameter is optional if you want the elements to be joined with a comma. Passing in an empty string as the argument will result in the elements joined without any characters/separators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the parameter is what you want to separate each pair of adjacent elements of the array for the returned string. If necessary, the separator is converted to a string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'Wind,Water,Fire' b/c no separator so joined with commas and no spaces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'Wind, Water, Fire' b/c separator is comma and space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'Wind + Water + Fire' b/c separator is space, plus sign, space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'WindWaterFire' b/c separator is an empty string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;Back to the Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-string-to-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From String to Array &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-split-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we can &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; string from array. We can also &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; string to array. Here, we are going to utilize the &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; example to see the alternative results from above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Wind, Water, Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* [
     'W', 'i', 'n', 'd', ',',
     ' ', 'W', 'a', 't', 'e',
     'r', ',', ' ', 'F', 'i',
     'r', 'e'
   ], no separators
*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 'Wind,', 'Water,', 'Fire' ], split by the whitespaces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 'Wind', ' Water', ' Fire' ], split by commas&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// As you can see there're still whitespaces in front of each element&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To solve this, we can do the following:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 'Wind', 'Water', 'Fire' ], split by commas and one additional whitespace&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This method is probably the most common way to split a string to an array and join afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, when we want to apply array methods to a given string, this is a go-to method to do so. For instance, if we want to reverse a string:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In comparison to:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// having to create a new string takes space&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unless your interviewer specifies &lt;code&gt;reverse()&lt;/code&gt; method is not allowed to be used, using the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; method would help create a more readable, cleaner code. Also, since &lt;code&gt;reverse()&lt;/code&gt; is not a string method, this is where we can utilize our array method in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palindrome is also another common question which you can make use of the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-arrayfromstring-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Array.from(string)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you can use &lt;code&gt;Array.from()&lt;/code&gt;. Either you want to modify and create a new shallow-copied array OR &lt;em&gt;drumroll please&lt;/em&gt; 🥁🥁🥁 converting string to array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To modify an array (Not the focus of this section)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Convert string to array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember, these are just some suggestive ways of converting string to array. &lt;br&gt;
According to this &lt;a href="https://blog.shovonhasan.com/never-use-array-from-to-convert-strings-to-arrays/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, using the same reversed example we have above, the runtime of using &lt;code&gt;String.prototype.split()&lt;/code&gt; is way faster than using &lt;code&gt;Array.from()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
But you know, at least we know &lt;code&gt;Array.from()&lt;/code&gt; is one of the possible ways to convert string to array!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-objectassign-string-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Object.assign([], string)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably heard of &lt;code&gt;Object.keys()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Object.entries()&lt;/code&gt; which would return a new array. What about &lt;code&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;br&gt;
Similar deal! &lt;br&gt;
According to MDN, the definition of &lt;code&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments: &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt;. In our case, our &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; is an empty array &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and our &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; is the given string (which is an enumerable/ can be iterated object).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ['f', 'o', 'o']&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yay! It works... on the surface... If you move this to TypeScript...&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;✋🏻PAUSE✋🏻&lt;br&gt;
For those who are not familiar with TypeScript, don't worry. Here's a quick breakdown. You don't have to fully understand TypeScript. All you have to know is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Most of the time, variables are assigned to a primitive data type in advance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In JS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In TS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cool thing about using TypeScript is that you would also see the variable type by hovering over the variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hYTqgO5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bxwuodfn7dzmy9yshmc0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hYTqgO5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bxwuodfn7dzmy9yshmc0.png" alt="Screenshot from CodeCademy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capiche? Hopefully you got the gist of it. Back to the topic...&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you move this to TypeScript, the type of this new copied array does not return as &lt;strong&gt;an array of string&lt;/strong&gt;. 😱 &lt;br&gt;
If we look at other methods we mentioned above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feel free to copy and paste the code to the &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/"&gt;playground&lt;/a&gt; and hover over &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
They both return &lt;code&gt;split: string[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from: string[]&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt; means array of strings.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you hover over &lt;code&gt;const obj = Object.assign([], str)&lt;/code&gt;. It returns...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MMXQbovs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4arulbcswlcpc2uuhkoc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MMXQbovs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4arulbcswlcpc2uuhkoc.png" alt="Screenshot for Object.assign()"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;obj : never[] &amp;amp; "foo"&lt;/code&gt;, a.k.a. it is never an array but a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't that interesting? 😮 (thanks to our &lt;a href="https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/83-4-ways-to-convert-string-to-character-array/#a-caveat-about-object-assign-%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we have 3 ways to convert strings to array, including the spread operator (will be explained in the Bonus Section below), it seems like &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; is the best way to do so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;Back to the Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#spread-operator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Spread Operator &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the spread operator (&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;)  is not specific to arrays, it is something helpful to know and use! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From MDN, the spread operator: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, essentially the spread operator takes each of the elements inside of the passed in object or array and adds it to the array it is being added to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is often used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in another list of some kind; typical use cases include copying arrays or concatenating an array to the end of an existing array. However, specifically for copying an array, the spread operator goes one level deep. Meaning that if you spread an array into another array, the array it was spread into will not be nested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it’s important to know that you cannot spread objects into an array or an array into an object. This is because objects alone are not iterable. However, when used in an array or with iterating functions (such as &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;), they become iterable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, when the merging occurs 2 objects together with the spread operator, it is assumed that another iterating function is used. On the other hand, if you spread a string into an array, it will create an array with each char in the string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// general example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;constructorArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [4, 1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;literalArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [4, 1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// copying an array- showing how the spread operator does not nest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[1], [2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[1], [2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[], [2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// cannot spread an object into an array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;key1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// TypeError: obj is not iterable&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// spreading a string into an array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o", "w", "o", "r", "l", "d"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#before-you-go"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before You Go... &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's conclude what we have discussed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-array-to-string-we-have"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From Array to String, we have...
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-string-to-array-we-have"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From String to Array, we have...
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assign.from()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.assign([], string)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, spread operator (&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;) can be used to convert array to string, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RSAUibP3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/http://37.media.tumblr.com/1dee0c9e399b34cc10c12d04506d5f10/tumblr_n53cb0KpVC1smcbm7o1_500.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RSAUibP3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/http://37.media.tumblr.com/1dee0c9e399b34cc10c12d04506d5f10/tumblr_n53cb0KpVC1smcbm7o1_500.gif" alt="Hello GIF"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is Waverley and Megan! We are both tech enthusiasts and graduated from Flatiron School recently. Both of us enjoy writing blogs to help other programmers learn and we learn from writing as well (win-win!). This will be our first time writing blogs on dev.to and collaborating on a series with each other, and we are so excited to create content for you all! &lt;strong&gt;Feedback is appreciated as we continue to navigate this process&lt;/strong&gt; 🙏 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first decided to collaborate we came up with a lot of topics to write about. However, as we are both currently in our job search and as bootcamp graduates, we wanted to work on something that will help us now and others in the future. Ultimately, we decided to have this series focus on data structures and algorithms, something we both feel is important to know but not exactly the easiest to understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, check out our Medium blogs for more of our work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to talk about converting array to string, and vice versa. This is one of the commonly seen strategies that is used when solving string-and-array-related coding questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, if you are interested in knowing array methods, here's &lt;a href="https://dev.to/wlcreate/all-about-javascript-arrays-array-methods-3n9"&gt;All About JavaScript Arrays &amp;amp; Array Methods!&lt;/a&gt; by Waverley; and for string methods, here's &lt;a href="https://dev.to/mehmehmehlol/when-to-use-these-string-methods-in-javascript-3m4h"&gt;When to Use these String Methods in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; by Megan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-contents"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Contents &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#array-to-string"&gt;From Array to String&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#toString"&gt;toString()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#join"&gt;join()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#string-to-array"&gt;From String to Array&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#split"&gt;split()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#array-from"&gt;Array.from()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#object-assign"&gt;Object.assign([], string)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#bonus"&gt;Bonus&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#spread-operator"&gt;Spread Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-array-to-string"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From Array to String &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that we often need to do is convert an array to a string. Thankfully JavaScript has two built-in methods to accomplish this: &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-tostring-endraw-returns-a-string-representing-the-array-and-its-elements-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt;: Returns a string representing the array and its elements (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its name, the &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method turns the array’s elements it was called on to a string. To be more specific, this method joins the array and returns one string containing each array element separated by commas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact&lt;/em&gt;: JavaScript calls the toString method automatically when an array is to be represented as a text value or when an array is referred to in a string concatenation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;array1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// "1,2,a,1a"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-join-endraw-join-all-the-elements-from-an-array-to-a-string-nondestructive"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;: Join all the elements from an array to a string (non-destructive)
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; creates and returns a string by concatenating, or joining, all of the elements of the array it was called on. By default the elements are separated by commas, however you can specify what you want to join/separate the elements by. On the other hand, if there is only one element in the array, the single item will be returned as a string without separators, and if there are no elements, an empty string is returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, including an argument for the separator parameter is optional if you want the elements to be joined with a comma. Passing in an empty string as the argument will result in the elements joined without any characters/separators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the parameter is what you want to separate each pair of adjacent elements of the array for the returned string. If necessary, the separator is converted to a string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Wind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'Wind,Water,Fire' b/c no separator so joined with commas and no spaces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'Wind, Water, Fire' b/c separator is comma and space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'Wind + Water + Fire' b/c separator is space, plus sign, space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;joinArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 'WindWaterFire' b/c separator is an empty string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;Back to the Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-string-to-array"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From String to Array &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-split-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we can &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; string from array. We can also &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; string to array. Here, we are going to utilize the &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; example to see the alternative results from above.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Wind, Water, Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* [
     'W', 'i', 'n', 'd', ',',
     ' ', 'W', 'a', 't', 'e',
     'r', ',', ' ', 'F', 'i',
     'r', 'e'
   ], no separators
*/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 'Wind,', 'Water,', 'Fire' ], split by the whitespaces&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 'Wind', ' Water', ' Fire' ], split by commas&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// As you can see there're still whitespaces in front of each element&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To solve this, we can do the following:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;splitToArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 'Wind', 'Water', 'Fire' ], split by commas and one additional whitespace&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This method is probably the most common way to split a string to an array and join afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, when we want to apply array methods to a given string, this is a go-to method to do so. For instance, if we want to reverse a string:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In comparison to:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// having to create a new string takes space&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unless your interviewer specifies &lt;code&gt;reverse()&lt;/code&gt; method is not allowed to be used, using the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt; method would help create a more readable, cleaner code. Also, since &lt;code&gt;reverse()&lt;/code&gt; is not a string method, this is where we can utilize our array method in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palindrome is also another common question which you can make use of the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-arrayfromstring-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Array.from(string)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you can use &lt;code&gt;Array.from()&lt;/code&gt;. Either you want to modify and create a new shallow-copied array OR &lt;em&gt;drumroll please&lt;/em&gt; 🥁🥁🥁 converting string to array.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// To modify an array (Not the focus of this section)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Convert string to array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember, these are just some suggestive ways of converting string to array. &lt;br&gt;
According to this &lt;a href="https://blog.shovonhasan.com/never-use-array-from-to-convert-strings-to-arrays/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, using the same reversed example we have above, the runtime of using &lt;code&gt;String.prototype.split()&lt;/code&gt; is way faster than using &lt;code&gt;Array.from()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
But you know, at least we know &lt;code&gt;Array.from()&lt;/code&gt; is one of the possible ways to convert string to array!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#-raw-objectassign-string-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;Object.assign([], string)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably heard of &lt;code&gt;Object.keys()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Object.entries()&lt;/code&gt; which would return a new array. What about &lt;code&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;br&gt;
Similar deal! &lt;br&gt;
According to MDN, the definition of &lt;code&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments: &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt;. In our case, our &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; is an empty array &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and our &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; is the given string (which is an enumerable/ can be iterated object).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ['f', 'o', 'o']&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yay! It works... on the surface... If you move this to TypeScript...&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;✋🏻PAUSE✋🏻&lt;br&gt;
For those who are not familiar with TypeScript, don't worry. Here's a quick breakdown. You don't have to fully understand TypeScript. All you have to know is that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Most of the time, variables are assigned to a primitive data type in advance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In JS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// In TS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cool thing about using TypeScript is that you would also see the variable type by hovering over the variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hYTqgO5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bxwuodfn7dzmy9yshmc0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hYTqgO5Z--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bxwuodfn7dzmy9yshmc0.png" alt="Screenshot from CodeCademy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capiche? Hopefully you got the gist of it. Back to the topic...&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you move this to TypeScript, the type of this new copied array does not return as &lt;strong&gt;an array of string&lt;/strong&gt;. 😱 &lt;br&gt;
If we look at other methods we mentioned above:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feel free to copy and paste the code to the &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/"&gt;playground&lt;/a&gt; and hover over &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
They both return &lt;code&gt;split: string[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from: string[]&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt; means array of strings.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you hover over &lt;code&gt;const obj = Object.assign([], str)&lt;/code&gt;. It returns...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MMXQbovs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4arulbcswlcpc2uuhkoc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MMXQbovs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4arulbcswlcpc2uuhkoc.png" alt="Screenshot for Object.assign()"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;obj : never[] &amp;amp; "foo"&lt;/code&gt;, a.k.a. it is never an array but a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't that interesting? 😮 (thanks to our &lt;a href="https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/83-4-ways-to-convert-string-to-character-array/#a-caveat-about-object-assign-%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we have 3 ways to convert strings to array, including the spread operator (will be explained in the Bonus Section below), it seems like &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; is the best way to do so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#toc"&gt;Back to the Table of Contents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bonus &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#spread-operator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Spread Operator &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the spread operator (&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;)  is not specific to arrays, it is something helpful to know and use! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From MDN, the spread operator: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, essentially the spread operator takes each of the elements inside of the passed in object or array and adds it to the array it is being added to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is often used when all elements from an object or array need to be included in another list of some kind; typical use cases include copying arrays or concatenating an array to the end of an existing array. However, specifically for copying an array, the spread operator goes one level deep. Meaning that if you spread an array into another array, the array it was spread into will not be nested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it’s important to know that you cannot spread objects into an array or an array into an object. This is because objects alone are not iterable. However, when used in an array or with iterating functions (such as &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;), they become iterable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, when the merging occurs 2 objects together with the spread operator, it is assumed that another iterating function is used. On the other hand, if you spread a string into an array, it will create an array with each char in the string.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// general example&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;constructorArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [4, 1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;literalArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [4, 1, 2, 3]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// copying an array- showing how the spread operator does not nest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[1], [2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[1], [2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[], [2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// [[2], [3]]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// cannot spread an object into an array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;key1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// TypeError: obj is not iterable&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// spreading a string into an array&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o", "w", "o", "r", "l", "d"]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;a href="#before-you-go"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Before You Go... &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's conclude what we have discussed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-array-to-string-we-have"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From Array to String, we have...
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;join()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;
  &lt;a href="#from-string-to-array-we-have"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  From String to Array, we have...
&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Assign.from()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.assign([], string)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, spread operator (&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;) can be used to convert array to string, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
