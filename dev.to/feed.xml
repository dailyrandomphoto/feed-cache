      <title>From Designer to Software Engineer to Solutions Architect: my journey</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to start this post with the regular disclaimer: this is my journey, and everything about it, is intrinsically bound to my nature as a person. A different person, under the same circumstances, may experience something totally different and get different results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain how I got here, I have to go all the way back to when I was studying to be a draftswoman, and was supposedly going to continue my education as a (buildings) architect. Somewhere down the road I fell in love with CAD, with computers and graphic design, and even got a job at a printshop after a Photoshop, Quark and Freehand crash course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003 I moved to Spain. Immigrating is difficult, especially when you have to support yourself entirely. But when I did I was lucky to have over 5 years of experience as a graphic designer, and it was easy for me to get a job working for a small agency as soon as I moved here. We published a magazine focusing on real estate and after a few months I was promoted to Creative Director to be in charge of the magazine and the corporate image of a few clients. I had a couple of designers in my team, and it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plot-twist" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plot twist
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year later, it was evident all business was moving online. Youtube was about to be born, Facebook was in diapers, and everyone wanted to have online presence. I convinced the manager we should have a website, and we should try to build an online version of the magazine as a portal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We need a web developer for that" -he said. "I will be the web developer". I answered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started spending all my spare time learning Action Script. I was amazed at those full screen Flash websites, featuring gorgeous animations and graphics. I wanted to learn to do that. For the portal, I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and mySQL. I was amongst the first avid consumers of online tutorials and web development books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with Joomla, Wordpress, and finally Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#and-then-the-2007-crisis-hit-us-hard" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  And then the 2007 crisis hit us hard
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could keep the boat afloat selling websites, exclusively. I would be in charge of designing the websites, managing the databases, the hosting, setting DNS records, configuring htaccess, installing the CMS and plugins, developing frontend, and doing the maintenance. I was a true "webmaster" of the time. I loved it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in 2011, we hit rock bottom. Most of our clients were developers and real estate agents, that bursted together with the real estate bubble. They had to close business, and so did we. I started freelancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#being-a-freelance-web-developer-is-a-247-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Being a freelance web developer, is a 24/7 job
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not working as a consultant for a much larger company and you have your own clients like I did, it's tough work. You're the sales person, the architect, the PM, the designer, the developer, the quality engineer, the tier 1 to 4 support person, the systems person, and the back office cashing the checks...you're it all. There are no evenings, no weekends... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a mom and a freelancer, was the most challenging thing I ever did. I breastfed my kid while patching 10 Drupal sites for &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/heartbleed"&gt;heartbleed&lt;/a&gt;. I ran to school while holding a call with a client.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-a-job-in-enterprise" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting a job in enterprise
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2014 I sent my CV to a consultant company (the same one I work for right now), with little hope. I had no CS degree, and all I had read around was I stood no chance to land a job in that league. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I did land the job as a Frontend Developer for Adobe Experience Manager projects. I had to move to Barcelona, with my family. It was an immense bet. And you can say fortunately, it went well. Although it was not only fortune: there was always a lot of hard work involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was not only fortune. There was always a lot of hard work and persistence involved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enterprise context has particularities, also. Working on enterprise you also learn a lot about politics, policies and processes. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-acquainted-with-adobe-experience-manager" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting acquainted with Adobe Experience Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until that day, Adobe was for me the company behind Photoshop, period. (Aaaand the company that had bought Macromedia and decommissioned my favorite ever vectors editor, Freehand ... :/ ) I had no idea they had also bought Day Software and had a CMS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very comfortable with content management systems, and it did not take me too long to wrap my head around how it worked. Some frontend developers want to stick to frontend code only, and it's respectable. But I was coming from a different kind of dynamics (see the freelancer part!) and I was happy to traverse the whole stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first role was as a Frontend Tech Lead for a very large platform being built from scratch. One year later, I was moved to a banking platform where I stayed for 6 months. Then I was assigned to a new account we had just gotten, as a tier 3 support and solutions engineer for a massive legacy platform. I was again in the role of Frontend Tech Lead, and I know a lot of people dislike working with legacy software, but I can promise you the amount of knowledge I was getting every single day working with it, was priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of knowledge I was getting every single day working with legacy code was priceless; the problems I had to solve were unique.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, no other experience is better to understand coupling, dependencies, and acquire an overall overview of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#plot-twist-again" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Plot twist, again
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from support, we were integrating new features, and at some point we decided we did not want the risk to build anymore on top of it, we wanted to go for cutting edge technologies. So a little bit more than a year later I got my first architect gig, working in the conceptualization and definitions of the 2.0 version for the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with designing systems. It is a lot like building with legos. And I could apply principles learned while studying to be a buildings architect. After all, you want the same for your buildings than you want for your systems, for them to meet quality standards, to be resilient, secure and durable, amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-first-presales-experience-was-intense" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My first pre-sales experience was intense
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2017 I also attended my first RfP workshop. A global leading brand issued a RfP (request for proposal) for a very large enterprise project and I helped in putting together the whole DevOps strategy, and then travelled onsite, together with the Account Manager, a UX Engineer, and two C-levels, to defend our proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to present the whole DevOps offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conferences-and-public-speaking-and-how-they-help-me-in-being-a-better-architect" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conferences and public speaking and how they help me in being a better architect
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an architect is a lot about communicating. You have to communicate your ideas and definitions or decisions to a team, other project leads and the clients. Translating those very technical concepts into simpler words and concepts any audience can understand demands highly developed communication skills. You need to be able to articulate and convey with simplicity, what sometimes are very abstract ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at conferences and other technical events, has definitely helped me grow more comfortable into that presenter role. But I have to admit it is never the same talking to a crowd of peers or other developers, than to a customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is, no matter who you are addressing, you need to build rapport. And the most optimal way to build rapport is to identify with the more human side by providing structure to your narrative in a way that it becomes a story your audience can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always, always put some work in your communication skills. Especially if you want to become an architect in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#collaborating-with-sales-teams" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Collaborating with sales teams
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, Solutions Architects have more of a backend/systems background. 4 years ago, it was already obvious to me that as the volume of frontend work was growing, the integrations were more complex, and there was a lot more to put together nicely. The role of a frontend expert during discovery phases was not only necessary, it was essential. I started paving the way to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a sales squad operating in northern Europe, in parallel to being a hybrid Tech Lead/Architect at the project I was assigned to (the one we won!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that team, I review code bases of potential clients/leads, join meetings to understand their problems and requirements, write architecture vision papers from infrastructure to tech stack, estimate and define timelines, estimate staffing needs, etc. Before COVID, I was traveling places to present those analysis or gather more information, or to build a connection with the clients, or to educate them on a certain subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I would fly for the day only to Amsterdam or Copenhagen, sit in a meeting, and come back in the evening right on time to have dinner with my family. It was exciting, but also intense, and if you want that, you have to be prepared. On the way there, I was putting together slides and documentation for that meeting. On the flight back, I was reviewing PR's from my own project.(Thank you Norwegian and all the airlines that have wi-fi onboard!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#leaving-the-tech-lead-role-behind" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Leaving the tech lead role behind
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point last year, we started working on a brand new concept that required a lot of high level definitions and I was officially anchored to the Solutions Architect pathway. In the context of the project I work at, I already had the architect role officially for 2 years, as part of our Holocracy organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company has their own role definitions and people energizing them are expected to deliver in different ways. At my current company, architects are definitely very hands-on. Our culture promotes and celebrates the intersection of architect and lead developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the domains where architects and tech leads work, although intersecting, are on opposite sides of the high-level design imaginary line. For those that are not familiar with the differences, this diagram may shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G6bkQz82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/njcuqf2nnumvu5u3l034.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--G6bkQz82--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/njcuqf2nnumvu5u3l034.jpg" alt="architect-vs-tech-lead"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-does-an-architect-do" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What does an architect do?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architects are in charge of high level definitions of a system. They are the connecting point between the business vision and requirements, and the technical know-how. Even if they can, architects will not care about the nitty gritty details of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architects are the connecting point between the business vision and requirements, and the technical know-how&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is probably the part that is more difficult to detach yourself from, when you transition from being a tech lead. When you review a pull request, your input is not really so necessary in terms of "You could've used this method here, instead of this other one".  Your concern is the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, you will find yourself less and less in contact with other developers, and working more on your own or with other architects, requirement engineers, system engineers, and quality assurance leads. That is probably the hardest part of the transition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you come from a frontend technical lead position, you will be less in the spotlight. Work at a high-level is less tangible and visible, but equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-day-to-day" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The day to day
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an architect, most of my (project) day is spent on client calls, team meetings to align the rest of the team on decisions made, partner calls, working on diagrams and documentation, and executing proof of concepts. I am more concerned about  API design and integrations, data storage, security, performance, CD/CI pipelines, releases and rollouts. I care about my client's system being legally and standards compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no longer part of the development sprint, and I don't deliver tasks in the scope of it. Do I miss it? I have to admit that I miss it less and less every time: for once, I really like what I do now. And I also enjoy tremendously the ability of delegating and seeing other people grow in the same direction I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sales support day is spent supporting proposals and discovery, attending meetings with leads, writing architecture visions, reviewing concepts by other architects, and preparing educational material pre and post sales. So everything I used to do before COVID, minus the traveling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-skills-required-to-become-a-solutions-architect" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The skills required to become a solutions architect
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's map what I do, to the skills I find the most useful. The soft skills required to do a great architect job are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication skills (ability to articulate but also to listen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation skills (put together great diagrams, and concise slide decks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diplomacy (you're at the front line with the client. It's all about business and especially in enterprise, you have to use a lot of patience and good manners)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manoeuvring (because of working together with the client, you have to have the capacity to manoeuvre and respond fast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical skills (your job is all about solving abstract problems, designing or fixing systems that many not even exist yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership skills (you have to lead your team and your client's team. You have to bring everyone onboard with what's best and the decisions made -which is a complex topic, sometimes, may not be the absolute best, but the most convenient in terms of parameters like time and budget-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to estimate and staff a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to prioritize &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical knowledge is also different than the one you needed to have as a tech lead. Apart from mastering a programming language, right now in 2021 I recommend you specialize in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cloud providers and their offerings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concepts like horizontal and vertical scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concepts like replication and sharding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serverless computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API patterns and contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CD/CI and how to build your pipelines effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;containerization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;orchestration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;architecture trends (like micro-services)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UML and different types of diagrams (flow, mindmaps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security and protocols (networks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a frontend focus, you can check this mindmap of useful skills I put together a bit ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jzab8gM7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cschryvfuc1t8gweb0l7.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jzab8gM7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cschryvfuc1t8gweb0l7.jpeg" alt="frontend architecture mindmap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnfibiaCreativa/status/1331565865196777472/photo/1"&gt;https://twitter.com/AnfibiaCreativa/status/1331565865196777472/photo/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, stay up to date! These are some of the architects I follow to keep myself informed on architectural trends. This list is relevant for me, you may need to find your own good sources ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lucamezzalira.com/"&gt;Luca Mezzalira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.angulararchitects.io/en/team/manfred-steyer-gde/"&gt;Manfred Steyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html"&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://danwahlin.me/"&gt;Dan Wahlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielwalt?lang=en"&gt;Gabriel Walt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#do-i-feel-like-my-coding-skills-are-suffering" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Do I feel like my coding skills are suffering?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not for now, for sure. I spend a lot of time coding, and being a GDE and other community activities I do, help with that. I see myself coding for a very long time, and my new focus only adds value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#finally" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Finally
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very important skill is the one of receiving feedback and acting upon it. If you want to become a great architect, find people that have been doing the job for a long time (this is valid for any profession, of course) and ask them for feedback and mentorship. Ask them to assign you tasks in areas where they see you're the weakest, so you have the chance to gain experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And...enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Thanks to Mario, Ina, Conrad, Tomasz, Andreas and Georg, who have been those mentors for me, from infrastructure, to architecture to soft-skills.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Ways to create a Navbar (CSS Grid Layout)</title>
      <author>crayoncode</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 10:54:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/crayoncode/3-ways-to-create-a-navbar-css-grid-layout-4kal</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/crayoncode/3-ways-to-create-a-navbar-css-grid-layout-4kal</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today let's build three different navbar layouts using the CSS grid layout and I'll show you, how easy it is to change the arrangement of the items without actually touching the markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the full article or watch me code this on Youtube (TL;DW):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrjSsWOuie4"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#result" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Result
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/crayon-code/embed/OJbLdpX?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#markup" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Markup
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markup is basically a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a logo (the feather)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;three navigation items and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a highlighted item for the user menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we're going to produce three different layout versions, the for loop is there to prevent us from copy-pasting ourselves.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;main
  // generates the navbar three times
  // each with different version classes
  // version-1, version-2 &amp;amp; version-3
  - for (let i=0; i&amp;lt;3; i++)
    header(class="version-" + (i+1))
      .logo
        i.fas.fa-feather-alt
      nav
        ul.nav
          li 
            a(href="#") 
              i.far.fa-chart-bar
              | Dashboard
          li 
            a(href="#") 
              i.far.fa-edit
              | Projects
          li 
            a(href="#") 
              i.far.fa-envelope-open
              | Posts
      a.user(href="#") 
        i.far.fa-user
        | Jane Doe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basics-background-amp-variables" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Basics, Background &amp;amp; Variables
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's first setup a few basic variables that define the background and foreground color, as well as some transition paramters which are used in multiple spots:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;--background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#2b2b2b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;--foreground-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;--transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;250ms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease-out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each navbar is also having its own highlight colors, which is why the &lt;code&gt;--color&lt;/code&gt; variable is defined within the scope of each version's own CSS class:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.version-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;--color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ba4aff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.version-2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;--color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#008aff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.version-3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;--color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#22d1d3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's also reset padding, margin and box-sizing on each element. Alternatively you can include a pre-made normalization/reset CSS file like normalize.css or sanitize.css.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;border-box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a fancy bonus, here's the code for the background which is just three different gradients stacked on top of each other in different angles:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;322deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ba4aff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#ba4aff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;70%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;178deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#008aff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#008aff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;70%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;linear-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;24deg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="mh"&gt;#00ffc6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;#00ffc6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;35%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#header-grid-configuration-outer-grid" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Header Grid Configuration (Outer Grid)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're going to use two nested grid layouts. The outer one on the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element  is simply there for providing the general layout of the navbar, so in order to tell where the logo, the navbar and the user menu is located:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;750px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Lato"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basic principle is to provide for each version of a navbar a different configuration for the columns and areas of the grid layout. A template area is a named section of the grid layout and an element can be assigned to it by providing the name of the area to it. And that's why it works, to change position of elements purely based on the CSS code, because only by switching or changing the values in &lt;code&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/code&gt; the browser adapts the places of the element and the order inside the markup becomes irrelevant:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logo (left), nav items (left), user menu (right)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.version-1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"logo nav user"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;place-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// logo (left), nav items (centered), user menu (right)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.version-2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"logo nav user"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;justify-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// user menu, nav items (centered), logo (right)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.version-3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min-content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;min-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"user nav . logo"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="na"&gt;justify-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pay close attention to the values in &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;min-content&lt;/code&gt; is used mostly for the logo because it should always consume as less space as possible / needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;max-content&lt;/code&gt; is used mostly for the user menu, since there are two words, &lt;code&gt;min-content&lt;/code&gt; word produce a word wrap, because in that case the column with is minimized. &lt;code&gt;max-content&lt;/code&gt; behaves that way that it maximizes the space for the content, but uses only as much space, as required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; in our case means that it takes the remaining space, which is just what we want for the navigation items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end, all we need to do is to assign those identifiers mentioned in the &lt;code&gt;grid-template-areas&lt;/code&gt; to the parts of the navbar and that's all being needed to setup the basic layout of the navbar.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.logo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#navigation-grid-configuration-inner-grid" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Navigation Grid Configuration (Inner Grid)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grid for the navigation items (&lt;code&gt;.nav&lt;/code&gt;) is a nested grid layout inside the outer grid that defines the general arrangement (logo, navigation items, user menu) in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. It uses the CSS grid's auto flow mechanics. This means that no explicit order of columns is defined, but each direct descendant element of the grid container (&lt;code&gt;.nav&lt;/code&gt;) is given its own column. We can tell the grid layout how to deal with elements that are not assigned to a certain cell or group of cells in the grid. &lt;code&gt;grid-auto-flow: column&lt;/code&gt; tells it to create a new column for each unassigned element. Setting it to &lt;code&gt;row&lt;/code&gt; would cause it to create a new row.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;grid-auto-columns&lt;/code&gt; is there to tell the grid which size auto-generated columns have, which is pretty awesome in our case, since we can simply tell it, to fit the content without wrapping it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.nav&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nav&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;grid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-auto-flow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-auto-columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;gap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;place-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#link-amp-icon-styling" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Link &amp;amp; Icon Styling
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's get into the finer details of the styling. Each link in the header navbar is a flex-box that centers its content vertically and also having a little bit of padding and rounded corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markup makes use of a few font-awesome icons, so each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is given the highlight color and rendered slightly smaller, such that it doesn't "overpower" the text.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// align content vertically&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foreground-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.5em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.7em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#link-hover-effect" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Link Hover Effect
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the hover effect we're going to use a nice &lt;code&gt;clip-path&lt;/code&gt; effect. Each link is given an &lt;code&gt;::after&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-element having the highlight color as background color and a &lt;code&gt;clip-path&lt;/code&gt; that slightly cuts of the bottom right corner. If the link is not hovered, its positioned to the left (invisible) and on hover it's shifted to the right such that it covers the link's area. The &lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; setup makes sure that the hightlight does not cover the text.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;--slantness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;4rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;z-index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slantness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slantness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;clip-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;polygon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nf"&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;slantness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;::after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#logo-amp-user-menu" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Logo &amp;amp; User Menu
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo is simply a feather icon from font awesome and is colored on hover. To give it a little bit of a prettier shape, the top left and right bottom corner is strongly rounded off, which fits the shape of the feather and provides a nice effect on hover.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.logo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;grid-area&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;place-self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;margin-right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;padding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.25rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;.25rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-top-left-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-bottom-right-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;2rem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nd"&gt;:hover&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nl"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make the user menu stand out a little, is given a slight box shadow to the inside using the highlight color. The same effect could have been achieved using a border, but the advantage of a box shadow is, that it does not affect the box-model and therefore keeps the size of the element consistent with the others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight scss"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nl"&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;inset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! The new year has just begun but the JavaScript world is already buzzing with exciting news and updates. While exploring various sources I have learned some interesting JavaScript stuff and eager to share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready to learn about key findings from two fresh reports on JavaScript trends, a new micro-framework from the DHTMLX team, a major update of the Snowpack build tool, and the latest web initiatives. In addition, I have also collected some tips and articles that will help to broaden your knowledge and skills in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s roll!&lt;/p&gt;

  Highlighting New JavaScript Trends
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sGg_UGdT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/n6d9o19zrlhgoa0vqwww.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sGg_UGdT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/n6d9o19zrlhgoa0vqwww.jpg" alt="JavaScript Trends"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turbulent year of 2020 is over, but we continue analyzing changes that have been reshaping the JavaScript landscape over the last twelve months to better understand the upcoming trends. For this purpose, I offer to take advantage of two recently released JavaScript surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State of JS is one of the most popular and insightful JavaScript research projects based on real user feedback. The 2020 edition reveals some interesting facts. First of all, the majority of responders (more than 88%) still love using JavaScript for building apps, but at the same time, a considerable part of the survey participants (39%) think that JavaScript is overcomplicated. When talking about the state of things in JavaScript technologies, it is worth mentioning the growing popularity of Svelte and Snowpack, stable advancement of TypeScript and Next.js, as well as rising dissatisfaction with Angular, Redux, and Mocha. It is also nice to mention that dev.to is ranked in the top 3 of Blogs &amp;amp; Magazines read by developers. Get more valuable info on the &lt;a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/"&gt;State of JS page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript Rising Stars 2020 is another interesting source of information on the JavaScript trends based on the number of stars added to various tools on GitHub during the last year. The most starred JavaScript instruments of 2020 are Deno (+30.2k☆), Vue.js (+22.5k☆), React (+19.8k☆), Playwright (+19.7k☆), VS Code (+19.1k☆). Due to a different approach used for the preparation of this report, the results in key categories may differ from the State of JS outcomes, but it still can be useful to take a look at the &lt;a href="https://risingstars.js.org/2020/en"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introducing-dhtmlx-optimus" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introducing DHTMLX Optimus
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9W2D7Afk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j4x3e3dswjli761r4icp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9W2D7Afk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/j4x3e3dswjli761r4icp.png" alt="DHTMLX Optimus"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHTMLX Suite is a popular JavaScript library that provides a collection of lightweight and highly customizable UI widgets for implementing various functionalities in web projects. From now on, this library can be utilized more conveniently and productively with DHTMLX Optimus. It is a new micro-framework enabling web developers to build DHTMLX-based applications of any complexity with less time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework allows making the most of modern coding technologies such as ES6 classes, JS modules, and Webpack bundler. Thus, it is possible to define the front-end structure of a specific web app with a set of independent components (modules) and reuse them later in other projects. Optimus can also be employed in combination with any server-side technology. Here is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/DHTMLX/optimus-starter-app"&gt;step-by-step&lt;/a&gt; instruction on how to start using Optimus in real-case scenarios. If you want to learn more about this framework, check out the &lt;a href="https://dhtmlx.com/blog/dhtmlx-optimus-micro-framework-boosting-web-development-suite-ui-widgets/"&gt;release article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#meet-snowpack-v30" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Meet Snowpack v3.0
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SsJUVx3y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mvklcvg1yqreu0iz00ld.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SsJUVx3y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mvklcvg1yqreu0iz00ld.jpg" alt="Snowpack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast, simple, efficient – these are three words that vividly describe a bundle-free and JavaScript ESM-powered build tool named Snowpack. The popularity of this tool is growing really fast and it is already considered by many as a viable alternative to more intricate and well-established tools such as Webpack. Earlier this month, Snowpack was updated to version 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This major release provides a set of powerful new features for faster web development. For instance, it offers a new way of loading any packages directly into your project via steaming imports. Another remarkable feature of this update is a build-in optimizer based on esbuild. This novelty helps to prepare production builds much faster than Webpack or Rollup. Starting from v3.0, Snowpack also comes with a modified JavaScript API and Node.js runtime. Find more details in the &lt;a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/2021-01-13-snowpack-3-0"&gt;release article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), one of the main driving forces behind the evolution of web standards, has recently established the MiniApps Working Group. MiniApp is a relatively new and promising format of mobile apps combining advantages of web technologies (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and enhanced user experience of native apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the W3C’s initiative is to work out specifications that will ensure maximal integration of MiniApps with the web architecture, better interoperability between various MiniApp platforms, and more active promotion of this technology among web developers. Read this &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/01/w3c-launches-the-miniapps-working-group/"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt; to get a deeper insight into the plans of the MiniApps Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

  Selecting Development Tools for Business Web Apps
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why JavaScript is continuously ranked high among programming languages in various surveys. One of the key factors in favor of JavaScript is its huge ecosystem and plenty of tools that significantly simplify various development stages. But the abundance of coding technologies raises a serious question of choice for developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking about building business apps, standard technology stacks are also frequently complemented with special JavaScript UI libraries. Such UI components help to implement comprehensive functionalities for project management, scheduling, data visualization, etc. This &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-web-development-tools-for-building-business-applications-in-2021-0n1234pe"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; contains a lot of useful information on top web development tools, including JS UI libraries, that suit well for developing business apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High performance is probably one of the key success indicators of any web application. As web development technologies are becoming more sophisticated, web developers have to consider a growing number of metrics, tools, and front-end techniques to achieve optimal application performance. Otherwise, it is hard to expect that end-users will get quick and seamless experience. Where to start improving performance? What are possible bottlenecks? And how to keep your app fast enough on a long-term basis? These and many other related questions are addressed in this great &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/front-end-performance-2021-free-pdf-checklist/"&gt;front-end performance checklist for 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Deal with Memory Leaks in Web Apps
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building a single-page application (SPA) some web developers pay little attention to keeping the app’s memory usage low. It can lead to memory leaks. This kind of issue can cause increased resource consumption in users’ devices, poor runtime performance, or even program crashes. If you are interested in learning techniques that will help to detect and fix memory leaks in SPAs, the &lt;a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2020/02/19/fixing-memory-leaks-in-web-applications/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; prepared by Nolan Lowson is exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You Don't Know JS: Scope &amp; Closures: What's the Scope?</title>
      <author>Rajat Verma</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rajat2502/you-don-t-know-js-scope-closures-what-s-the-scope-g12</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#chapter-1-whats-the-scope" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Chapter 1: What's the Scope?
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While working with JS, have you ever thought, How does it know which variables are accessible by any given statement, and how does it handle two variables of the same name?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The answers to questions like these take the form of well-defined rules called scope. In this book, we will dig deeper into all the aspects of scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's first uncover how the JS engine processes our programs: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we studied in the last book that JS is a compiled language and it is first parsed before the execution begins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code author's decisions on where to place variables, functions, and blocks with respect to each other are analyzed according to the rules of scope, during the initial parsing/compilation phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compiled-vs-interpreted" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compiled vs. Interpreted
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code compilation is a set of steps that process the text of your code and turn it into a list of instructions the computer can understand. Typically, the whole source code is transformed at once, and those resulting instructions are saved as output that can later be executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case of interpretation, the source code is transformed line by line; each line or statement is executed before immediately proceeding to process the next line of the source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is an image showing the difference between the two: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DMU26PM---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42200276/106129194-0ad25300-6186-11eb-9ca8-d0b7ebc32f88.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DMU26PM---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42200276/106129194-0ad25300-6186-11eb-9ca8-d0b7ebc32f88.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's now learn about the compilation of a program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compiling-code" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compiling Code
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope is primarily determined during compilation, so understanding how compilation and execution relate is key in mastering scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are mainly three stages of compilation:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tokenizing/Lexing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parsing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tokenizinglexing" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tokenizing/Lexing
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking up a string of characters into meaningful (to the language) chunks, called tokens. For eg:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  var a = 2;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This program would likely be broken up into the following tokens: &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; , and &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. Whitespace may or may not be persisted as a token,     depending on whether it's meaningful or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#parsing" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Parsing
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsing is the process of taking a stream of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements, called the &lt;strong&gt;Abstract Syntax Tree&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;AST&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the tree for &lt;code&gt;var a = 2;&lt;/code&gt; might start with a top-level node called &lt;code&gt;VariableDeclaration&lt;/code&gt; , with a child node called &lt;code&gt;Identifier&lt;/code&gt; (whose value is a ), and another child called &lt;code&gt;AssignmentExpression&lt;/code&gt; which itself has a child called &lt;code&gt;NumericLiteral&lt;/code&gt; (whose value is 2 ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#code-generation" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Code Generation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code generation involves taking an AST and turning it into executable code. This part varies greatly depending on the language, the platform it's targeting, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The implementation details of a JS engine (utilizing system memory resources, etc.) are much deeper than we will dig here. We'll keep our focus on the observable behavior of our programs and let the JS engine manage those deeper system-level abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#required-two-phases" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Required: Two Phases
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important observation we can make about the processing of JS programs is that it occurs in (at least) two phases: parsing/compilation first, then execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The separation of a parsing/compilation phase from the subsequent execution phase is an observable fact, There are three program characteristics you can observe to prove this to yourself: syntax errors, early errors, and hoisting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#syntax-errors-from-the-start" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Syntax Errors from the Start
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the program:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var greeting = "Hello";
console.log(greeting);
greeting = ."Hi";
// SyntaxError: unexpected token .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we try to execute this program it shows no output, but instead throws a &lt;code&gt;SyntaxError&lt;/code&gt; about the unexpected &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; token right before the &lt;code&gt;"Hi"&lt;/code&gt; string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since, JS is a compiled language and not interpreted (line by line), the string was not printed, and the program was executed as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#early-errors" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Early Errors
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, consider:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;console.log("Howdy");
saySomething("Hello", "Hi");
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not
// allowed in this context
function saySomething(greeting, greeting) {
  "use strict";
  console.log(greeting);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;"Howdy"&lt;/code&gt; message is not printed, despite being a well-formed statement. Instead, just like the snippet in the previous section, the SyntaxError here is thrown before the program is executed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, it's because strict-mode (opted in for only the saySomething(..) function here) forbids, among many other things, functions to have duplicate parameter names; this has always been allowed in non-strict-mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here also, we can observe that the code was first fully parsed and then only the execution began. Otherwise, the string &lt;code&gt;"Howdy"&lt;/code&gt; would be printed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#hoisting" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Hoisting
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, consider:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function saySomething() {
  var greeting = "Hello";
  {
    greeting = "Howdy"; // error comes from here
    let greeting = "Hi";
    console.log(greeting);
  }
}
saySomething();
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greeting' before initialization
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The noted ReferenceError occurs from the line with the statement &lt;code&gt;greeting = "Howdy"&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's happening is that the greeting variable for that statement belongs to the declaration on the next line, &lt;code&gt;let greeting = "Hi"&lt;/code&gt;, rather than to the previous var greeting = "Hello" statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here also, we can notice that the JS engine could only know, at the line that error is thrown, that the next statement would declare a block-scoped variable of the same name ( greeting ) is if the JS engine had already processed this code in an earlier pass, and already set up all the scopes and their variable associations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#compiler-speak" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Compiler Speak
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's now learn how the JS engine identifies the variables and determines their scopes as the program is compiled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's first see an example:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var students = [
  { id: 14, name: "Kyle" },
  { id: 73, name: "Suzy" },
  { id: 112, name: "Frank" },
  { id: 6, name: "Sarah" },
];

function getStudentName(studentID) {
  for (let student of students) {
    if (student.id == studentID) {
      return student.name;
    }
  }
}

var nextStudent = getStudentName(73);

console.log(nextStudent);
// Suzy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All occurrences of variables/identifiers in a program serve in one of two "roles": either they're the target of an assignment or they're the source of a value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a variable is being assigned a value, then it is a &lt;strong&gt;target&lt;/strong&gt; otherwise a &lt;strong&gt;source&lt;/strong&gt; of value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#targets" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Targets
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the above code, since the &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nextStudent&lt;/code&gt; variables are assigned a value so they are both targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three other target assignment operations in the code that are perhaps less obvious. One of them:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (let student of students) {
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This statement assigns a value to &lt;code&gt;student&lt;/code&gt; for each element of the array &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another target reference:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;getStudentName(73);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, the argument &lt;code&gt;73&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to the parameter &lt;code&gt;studentID&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last target reference in the program is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function getStudentName(studentID) {
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; declaration is a special case of a target reference. Here the identifier &lt;code&gt;getStudentName&lt;/code&gt; is assigned a function as a value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have identified all the targets in the program, let's now identify the sources!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sources" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sources
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sources are as follows:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (let student of students)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code&gt;student&lt;/code&gt; is a target but the array &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt; is a source reference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (student.id == studentID)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this statement, both the &lt;code&gt;student&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;studentID&lt;/code&gt; are source references.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;return student.name;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;student&lt;/code&gt; is also a source reference in the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;getStudentName(73)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getStudentName&lt;/code&gt; is a source reference (which we hope resolves to a function reference value). In &lt;code&gt;console.log(nextStudent)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; is a source reference, as is &lt;code&gt;nextStudent&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; In case you were wondering, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; are all properties, not variable references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cheating-runtime-scope-modifications" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Cheating: Runtime Scope Modifications
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope is determined as the program is compiled, and should not generally be affected by runtime conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, in non-strict-mode, there are technically still two ways to cheat this rule, modifying a program's scopes during runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first way is to use the &lt;code&gt;eval(..)&lt;/code&gt; function that receives a string of code to compile and execute on the fly during the program runtime. If that string of code has a &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt; declaration in it, those declarations will modify the current scope that the &lt;code&gt;eval(..)&lt;/code&gt; is currently executing in:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function badIdea() {
eval("var oops = 'Ugh!';");
console.log(oops);
}

badIdea(); // Ugh!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;eval(..)&lt;/code&gt; function was not present, the program would throw an error that the variable &lt;code&gt;oops&lt;/code&gt; was not defined. But eval(..) modifies the scope of the &lt;code&gt;badIdea()&lt;/code&gt; function at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second way to cheat is the &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which essentially dynamically turns an object into a local scope — its properties are treated as identifiers in that new scope's block:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var badIdea = { oops: "Ugh!" };

with (badIdea) {
  console.log(oops); // Ugh!
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global scope was not modified here, but badIdea was turned into scope at runtime rather than compile-time, and its property oops becomes a variable in that scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; At all costs, avoid &lt;code&gt;eval(..)&lt;/code&gt; (at least, &lt;code&gt;eval(..)&lt;/code&gt; creating declarations) and &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;. Again, neither of these cheats is available in strict-mode, so if you just use strict-mode (you should!) then the temptation goes away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lexical-scope" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lexical Scope
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS's scope is determined at compile-time, the term for this kind of scope is &lt;strong&gt;lexical scope&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Lexical" is associated with the "lexing" stage of compilation, as discussed earlier in this chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to note that compilation doesn't do anything in terms of reserving memory for scopes and variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for this chapter. I will be back with the notes of the next chapter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till then, &lt;strong&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Intro
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this blog series I've teamed up with &lt;a class="comment-mentioned-user" href="https://dev.to/emmarslight"&gt;@emmarslight&lt;/a&gt;
/&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlightEmma"&gt;@SlightEmma&lt;/a&gt; to give you an insight of what it's like starting your first job in tech but on opposite sides of the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in the UK and started in my role as Developer Relations Lead for Veeqo on the 18th January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma is in New Zealand and also started her role as Apprentice Software Engineer for Next Chapter Studio on the 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week we’ll be giving you the low down of what we learnt, what it’s like being part of a virtual team and of course any advice for getting and starting your first role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments or tweet us &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lauracharvey"&gt;@lauracharvey&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlightEmma"&gt;@SlightEmma&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll do our best to answer them in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

  Who am I?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm Laura, a career changer at age 29. I just started my first role in tech after graduating from the General Assembly Software Engineering "bootcamp".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about my journey here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-my-new-role" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What my new role?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working at Veeqo as Developer Relations Lead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevRel has existed in large tech companies for a long time but is now being adopted by smaller companies and therefore becoming more widely seen in the industry. The role itself can vary greatly from company to company but in my role, I will be looking after the Veeqo public API, improving on it, making error messages easier to understand, ensuring the documentation is top notch and also improving relationships with 3rd party developers, making developer experience the best it can be, offering them support with queries and speaking publicly about Veeqo and our API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-veeqo" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's Veeqo?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veeqo is a platform for e-commerce retailers to manage their business, we integrate with companies/platforms such a Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Amazon, Ebay, Etsy, Royal Mail, DHL, DPD, Xero and Quickbooks so e-commerce retailers can manage things like buying, selling, returns, picking, packing, shipping, inventory and accounting across multiple channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an omnichannel retailer has their own Shopify store but they also sell stock through Amazon and Ebay. They can make Veeqo “master of stock” and control all 3 stores through Veeqo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all retailers want to use Veeqo in its entirety or they may want to integrate with some in house software they already have, that’s where our public API comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-was-my-first-week-like" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What was my first week like?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job from the comfort of my living room was very strange, I missed finding a new coffee shop on my new daily commute and getting those first day butterflies, but it was also nice to feel at ease straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veeqo’s onboarding process was a breeze and as someone who has started in lots of temporary positions over the last few years it was a breath of fresh air to see how seamless it was from job offer to first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They posted all my equipment to me the week before I started and also sent my logins for my email and HR portal so as soon as I logged in, I had access to various meeting requests and the company Slack channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first meeting of the day was with my manager, she gave me a brief introduction and laid out my onboarding plan for the next 4-weeks, Veeqo is a platform of many parts so I will be spending a week on each section initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also suggested that I use my self-learning times to learn Ruby with the aim of building a small application using Ruby and the Veeqo API once I have got to grips with it. I was also told that every Friday afternoon our engineering team get time to work on side projects and/or learn a new topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was assigned my “Coffee Buddy” through Slack who is another employee of the company assigned at random, I am looking forward to meeting them this coming Monday (25th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the third Monday of January is known as “Blue Monday” and is said to be the most depressing day of the new year. To help everyone feel more chipper our Head of People created a whiteboard and asked us to tell our colleagues why we love them. It was really beautiful and uplifting to see the messages of love and really helped me feel like I’d chosen the right place in Veeqo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent time with the Support Manager going through an overview of the platform and understanding what 1st, 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd Line Support do. The morning was spent on a Zoom call with a platform run through and then in the afternoon I was given a list of tasks to attempt in the platform as if I was a retailer such as setting up an order or creating a new stock item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched some videos going over the platform in more detail and certain things that are more challenging to achieve in the platform. In the afternoon I shadowed someone from 1st Line Support while they were dealing with customer queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first day dedicated to “self-learning”. It felt nice to be trusted and have the autonomy to structure my learning myself. I spent my morning going over some more product videos, the developer forum and learning some Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was assigned my “Veeqo Buddy” who is now my go to person should I have any problems. We scheduled catch ups for Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day of self-learning but with a few breaks for meeting members of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first meeting of the day was with my Veeqo Buddy, we had a really nice chat for half an hour about both work and non-work-related topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then met with the Head of Sales and had to wrack my brain for non-technical ways to describe APIs, Developers and Developer Relations. We chatted about my role and how it might link in with their team and what they're working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a quick Slack chat with the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the afternoon I met with Head of People who just wanted to check in to see how my first week had been and make sure I was settling in well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished off the day learning about Hashes and Symbols in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first week was great, I’m learning more about Veeqo as a company and their product and I’m so glad I made the decision to work with them. I’m excited to get more stuck in but I feel like I’ve got a lotttttt to learn first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to heading back to work on Monday (it’s been a while since I’ve said that!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-am-i" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who am I?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma... a proud Kiwi, living in Mount Maunganui, NZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago almost to the day of writing this I wrote my first line of code. Up until that point I had little  interest in computer programming and certainly never considered a career as a software engineer something I would want to pursue. I'll write a more detailed blog post about how I ended up in tech if anyone is interested, but here are the highlights..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a goal to learn what was involved in building a website (I’m a nerd, I like to know how things work!)  and the discovery of websites such as edX and Coursera (offering free, college level courses) my adventures in online learning began. The first course was a basic Computer Science 101, a good introduction to how computers and the internet worked but I wanted something a bit more challenging. Which led me to the (infamous?) free Harvard CS50, Introduction to Computer Science . Although there were definitely moments where I felt out of my depth, I also discovered there is nothing like that feeling when you press enter, your code runs (after days spent debugging) and it passes all the tests successfully. Hallelujah!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding that software development was a career I wanted to pursue, I enrolled in Enspiral Dev Academy's 14 week web development Bootcamp, graduating at the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have met great people online, read articles about web development, watched youtube videos and tried to code everyday. In the end all the hard work payed off and I was offered a job a couple of days before Christmas(2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-job" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The job...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working as an Apprentice Software Engineer at Next Chapter Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Chapter is a new creative agency of around 10-12 people, 5 developers + our tech director and the rest are product/graphic designers. We are a remote company with everyone living in different parts of the country. Although the company is an agency with the design team working with different clients, the software team has a single client and are working on a large project for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-first-week" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The first week...
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week before I started work I had received my company laptop and had along with all the necessary logins for the company online workspaces(bit.ai, Google, Jira, BitBucket and Miro). My weekly schedule was setup in google calendar with a link to each zoom meeting already filled. I had also received a fantastic email from the tech lead welcoming me to the company. The email outlined what  to expect on Monday and he gave me a couple of tasks to complete during my first week of work. I couldn't ask for a better start to a new job let alone a whole new career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up a bit earlier than usual, actually dressed up a little (even though i would be working from home)and put some product in my hair. Then logged in to my my first zoom meeting of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief meeting with the Tech Lead, there was a company wide meeting at 9:30 where everyone reconnected after the weekend. After introductions and learning what everyone's favourite desert is, I was surprised to find myself playing Pictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the company "Masterpiece" space on Figma (where every work of art is preserved for prosperity!) we played a couple of rounds of Pictionary. Everyone is making guesses from the first pen stroke... a lot of fun, and I think it will always be a great way to start the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this i met with the Senior Engineer for the project I would be working on. We had a chat about the tech stack that the project used and that I would need to become familiar with the CMS that is used, a piece of Open Source software called Strapi. I was then given a list of articles/tutorials and videos to go through so I could learn how to use Strapi with a Next.js application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rest of the Week:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week I spent going through the tutorials and docs for Strapi and when I needed a break from that, I tried to familiarise myself with the code base of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will admit at times i didn't feel like I was at work, sitting on the couch while watching youtube videos or reading articles has been an almost daily activity for me for months now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that I was given a task on Monday and that was all the contact I had all week. There are 3, 15 min stand-ups a week for the engineering team to learn what everyone is working on that day, ask for help if needed that sort of thing. I also had my first 1 on 1 meeting with my tech lead, obviously as it was my first week we just spent the time getting to know each other a bit, and talking about the goals of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other thing of note for the week was a meeting with one of software engineers who has been working on the project since the beginning. It was set for Friday giving me time to start going through the code-base and forming a basic impression of how things would fit together. It worked out brilliantly, I learned how each of the repositories fit together and about some of the complexities that come up trying to get a project to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lesson-of-the-week" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lesson of the week:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not expected to hit the ground running, contributing code and adding value to the company in your first week on the job!! Give yourself time to settle in, get to know the people you are working with! No one expects you to know the ins and outs of the code-base week one!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 Things I wish I knew as a Junior Developer</title>
      <author>Simon Holdorf</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 09:03:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/simonholdorf/8-things-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-junior-developer-4g7d</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/simonholdorf/8-things-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-junior-developer-4g7d</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a junior developer is not easy. You have a lot of work to do, and you're expected to know everything that's going on in your company. These tips will help you get started on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Don't be afraid to ask questions
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is probably one of the most critical skills for any programmer. You should always try to learn something new when working on a problem or feature, even if it's just some new concept that might come in handy later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, there are times when you will encounter issues that have already been solved by someone else (such as Stack Overflow). In these cases, don't be afraid to ask for help! It's better to spend 10 minutes googling and asking questions than spending 2 hours debugging an issue that someone else has already solved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is true for &lt;a href="https://thesmartcoder.dev/the-road-from-junior-to-senior-developer/"&gt;senior developers&lt;/a&gt;. You never know what obscure problem someone else might run into that will save them time down the road (or even give them ideas for features they could implement). Even if it doesn't help anyone directly, every question asked and answered helps everyone indirectly by increasing our collective knowledge base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company has a mentorship program or internal forums where you can ask questions, take advantage of them! Even if they aren't related to your specific project or team, asking about general issues will likely still help you out in the long run.  &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-dont-worry-about-seniority" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Don't worry about seniority
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most critical point on this list. It's straightforward to get caught up in the idea of seniority and worry about whether or not you are "senior enough" to do a particular task. There is no such thing as being "senior enough" for anything in my experience. If you think you are ready, then go ahead and try it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you fail at first, learn from your mistakes and move on. You can always ask for help if you need it. Just remember that seniority is all relative. There will always be someone who has more experience than you, so don't let that hold you back from doing something because of how it will look on your resume or portfolio.  &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-be-proactive" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Be proactive
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful in software development, immensely as a junior developer, it helps to take the initiative when solving problems or implementing features. This means going above and beyond what was asked of you and making sure that things are done the first time correctly (it also makes it easier for other developers to review your code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally find this approach useful because it allows me to learn more about the problem domain I am working in (which is often a requirement when working with larger projects). Asking questions during these times can be helpful, too, since they often lead to discussions about why individual decisions were made or why certain approaches were taken (this may help guide future decision-making). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if your ideas aren't implemented right away, they might inspire others or even make their way into future versions of the product (I have seen this happen many times before). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also helps build trust with your team members since they know that you will do what needs to be done without continually asking them for guidance.  &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-write-good-code" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Write good code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious, but it's straightforward to get caught up in the idea of shipping features and not worrying about how they are implemented. This is especially true when working on a team with many developers (or even working alone). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, writing good code makes it easier for other developers to read and review your work (which saves time in the long run). It also makes it easier for you to understand your own code later on (saving time in the short run). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have never written tests before, this is another area where you can take the initiative and learn more about your language or framework by reading about testing strategies or writing some simple tests yourself. If you write tests, they will help you catch bugs early on instead of debugging them after a feature has been shipped. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-read-code" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Read code
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty obvious, but it's still essential. Reading code is a great way to learn how things are done in other projects and languages. It also allows you to see what kinds of problems developers face when writing software, which will help you with problem-solving later on in your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever get stuck on something and need help from someone else, being able to explain the problem is extremely important. This helps with communication between developers as well as collaboration on projects (which should be the primary goal of any developer). Also, reading code may just give you some ideas for your own project! &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-learn-from-others" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Learn from others
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point should be obvious too, but I think it's important enough that I wanted to mention it anyway. Take advantage of opportunities to learn from others! For example, if someone asks a question on Stack Overflow that you know the answer, go ahead and answer it! You might also consider sharing your knowledge by blogging or speaking at meetups/conferences. Even if your answer isn't directly related to your job duties, there is still value in answering questions since you are likely learning something new while doing so (this might help solve future problems that come up as well). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, keep an eye out for articles/videos/podcasts/books that might be relevant to what you are working on. These can often explain why certain decisions were made and how they could be improved upon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, don't forget about books! Books are probably one of the best ways to learn new things because they allow you to read at your own pace without being interrupted by meetings or interruptions from coworkers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many great books out there that cover a wide range of topics. Ensure that whatever book(s) you choose covers topics relevant to what you do day-to-day!   &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-practice-what-you-learn" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Practice what you learn
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to solidify your knowledge of a topic, and it's also an easy way to show off what you have learned to others (such as interviewers or potential employers). You could start doing some &lt;a href="https://thesmartcoder.dev/9-awesome-projects-you-can-build-with-vanilla-javascript/"&gt;JavaScript practice projects&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a little more difficult if you are working on a large project, but there are still opportunities to practice what you learn. For example, maybe you can implement some features using the latest technology that your company just started using. If not, you can try implementing some small feature using this new technology and sharing it with your team members. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is that even if you aren't able to use the new stuff at work, there are plenty of opportunities outside of work where you can show off what you have learned (such as meetups/conferences or hackathons). You might even consider writing blog posts about the technologies/frameworks that interest you. I have found many useful articles/videos on blogs before!   &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#8-dont-worry-about-experience" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  8. Don't worry about experience
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this one applies more to junior developers who have recently graduated from college or Bootcamp. It's very easy for junior developers who just graduated to focus too much on building up their resume and acquiring "senior level" experience instead of focusing on learning new things and developing their skillset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this approach doesn't always work out well in the long run because it leads to junior developers trying to do things they aren't ready for yet (and then getting frustrated when they fail). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I would recommend focusing on learning new things regardless of whether or not they will help your resume in the short term. If anything, take advantage of opportunities to build your skillset and give yourself an edge over other candidates during interviews (even if they don't lead directly to a job offer). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don't worry about whether or not something counts as "senior-level experience". Only worry about whether or not something will help you become a better developer!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-thoughts" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Final Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior developers should really focus on the fundamentals of programming and building projects while also improving their problem-solving skills. This will help you develop into a better developer over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enough JavaScript to get you Started : #19 IIFE✨</title>
      <author>Adarsh Pandya</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:04:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/whoadarshpandya/enough-javascript-to-get-you-started-19-iife-3j2k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/whoadarshpandya/enough-javascript-to-get-you-started-19-iife-3j2k</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#iife" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  IIFE ✨
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 IIFE or &lt;code&gt;immediately invoked functions as expressions&lt;/code&gt; simply refers to a function which runs as soon as it is defined.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Which means if you have to write a function which runs in beginning of your web app , you can use IIFE.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 in early days if we want to do something like this we need to define a function and call it... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 but with IIFE design pattern the syntax and the code makes much more sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 IIFE takes 2 parentheses , one is meant for defining a anonymous function and another is meant to call the anonymous function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Syntax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(
  // anonymous function
  function () {
    //function body
})();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;br&gt;
👉 We'll create one IIFE which will greet user as soon as he/she comes to our website 😀 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
👉 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example : the old way&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function greet () {
    alert('hello user ! how are you?');
}

greet();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example : the new way&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;(function(){
    alert('hello user ! how are you?');
})();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example : Arrow functions as IIFE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;( () =&amp;gt; {
      alert('hello user ! how are you?');
})();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me know in comment section if you have any doubt or feedback. it's always worth to give time to the thriving developer community :) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Keep Coding ❤

      <title>Create Loading Animations with SVG and CSS</title>
      <author>James Sinkala</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 07:23:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/xinnks/create-loading-animations-with-svg-and-css-1d0p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/xinnks/create-loading-animations-with-svg-and-css-1d0p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to go about creating loading animations for your web projects that doesn't involve loading assets from your web server, external CDN's or third party Javascript plugins is creating it within your web app using the same web technologies you use to render them.&lt;br&gt;
This ensures that your animations appear just as soon as you need them making sure the user experience isn't affected based on the speed of a user's connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we are going to make a simple loading animation for web projects using HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result we are after is the following animation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--huFQ3nbp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gqmymopg8bignlcfhvcx.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--huFQ3nbp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gqmymopg8bignlcfhvcx.gif" alt="Loading Animation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following html template:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"svg-loader"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"svg-container"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"100"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"100"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;viewBox=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"0 0 100 100"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"loader-svg bg"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cx=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"50"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cy=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"50"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;r=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"45"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/circle&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;circle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"loader-svg animate"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cx=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"50"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;cy=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"50"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;r=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"45"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/circle&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/svg&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As evident from the illustration above the animation template consists of two circles one on top of another, with the first circle being thicker than the second one both having the same circumference giving the illusion of one circle being inside the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cx and cy attributes inside the circles are the x-axis and y-axis coordinates respectively of the two circles. They make sure that the two circles are centered on the same coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the following css:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.svg-loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;align-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space-around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;justify-content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.loader-svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;absolute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;5px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-linecap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;148&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.loader-svg.bg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;8px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;207&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;205&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;245&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above css makes sure the loading component is centered within it's container also making sure there are different stroke widths and colors for the two circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then animate the second circle, which will be on top of the first circle with CSS to complete our loading animation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.animate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;242.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fill-animation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cubic-bezier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;infinite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;@keyframes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fill-animation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;242.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dashoffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;141.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dashoffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;141.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="err"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;40&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;242.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="py"&gt;stroke-dashoffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;282.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here's what's going on in the above css.&lt;br&gt;
When we draw our circle it is simply a single dash stroke painting the outline of our shape from beginning to the end of the circle, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray"&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; attribute gives us the ability to break that into a pattern of dashes and gaps. We can exploit this feature to obtain the animation end result that we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a smooth animation effect like the one above we need to know the circumference of the circle, where circumference = 2 x &lt;em&gt;pi&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;radius&lt;/em&gt;. We then use the &lt;em&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/em&gt; attribute to draw a maximum of one dash and gap alternating their sizes at different states of the animation while maintaining the circumference length when the two are added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a circle radius of 45 we get the circumference of 282.6, so when we set the &lt;em&gt;stroke-dasharray&lt;/em&gt; value to 141.3 it means that the dash and gap have that same value which add to give a sum of 282.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dashoffset"&gt;stroke-dashoffset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; attribute is a presentation attribute defining an offset on the rendering of the associated dash array, this offset gives the rotational effect to the loading animation, otherwise the animation will appear broken. This is all that is happening in the &lt;strong&gt;fill-animation&lt;/strong&gt; animation. &lt;br&gt;
We finish by applying this animation to the second circle with the &lt;em&gt;.animation&lt;/em&gt; class making sure that this animation goes on infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a base to the sort of animations one can make with SVG and CSS, get experimental and creative creating fast and pixel perfect loading animations for your web projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a code example of Redux with only HTML &amp;amp; pure JavaScript. &lt;a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/fast-leftpad-ruo9l?file=/index.html"&gt;Code sandbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valueEl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;currentReducer&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;counterReducer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;currentState&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;preloadedSate&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When store is created, it initially &lt;code&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; with action type is &lt;code&gt;'@@redux/INIT'&lt;/code&gt; so that every reducer returns their initial state. In case &lt;code&gt;counterReducer&lt;/code&gt;, it returns &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-happens-inside-raw-dispatch-endraw-function-" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What happens inside &lt;code&gt;dispatch&lt;/code&gt; function ?
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Dispatch function inside Redux store&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentReducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listeners&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentListeners&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextListeners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listeners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listener&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listeners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;listener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;currentReducer&lt;/code&gt; is called which is &lt;code&gt;counterReducer&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because action type is &lt;code&gt;@@redux/INIT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;currentState&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;counterReducer&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; as default value which is the initial state of the store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, &lt;code&gt;currentState&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After updating the state with initial value, it calls all listeners that is subscribing the store to notify.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valueEl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;valueEl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;innerHTML&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this case, we have &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; function, it is called back and update the DOM element with the initial value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now in the browser, we will se the number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; shown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#updating-state-when-action-is-sent" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Updating state when action is sent
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;INCREMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When users click on the button "+", store dispatches the action with type &lt;code&gt;'INCREMENT'&lt;/code&gt; to the reducer of the store and the flow is the same as explanation above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function &lt;code&gt;currentReducer&lt;/code&gt; is called with state is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and action's type is &lt;code&gt;'INCREMENT'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;'INCREMENT'&lt;/code&gt; is a case inside &lt;code&gt;counterReducer&lt;/code&gt; function, so the new state now is equal to &lt;code&gt;0 + 1&lt;/code&gt; and returned to the state of the store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, again it notifies listeners to let them know state is updated successfully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, in the screen we will see Clicked: 1 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flow is similar to other action types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is basically how Redux works under the hood. In real life project, Redux store may have multiple &lt;code&gt;reducers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;midleware&lt;/code&gt;, and 3rd-party libraries enhance Redux workflow. But at very its core that's how it works basically !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Easy Way to console.log() w/o console.log()
</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re hunting for a bug or writing code, you likely use Javascript’s ‘console.log()’. It works but &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; has 19 other methods to assist your development and debugging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably is &lt;code&gt;console.table()&lt;/code&gt; when working with objects and arrays, which provides a prettier format for these data types. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#consoletable-for-arrays-objects-and-mixed-data-types" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  console.table() - for arrays, objects, and mixed data types
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#output-an-array-and-array-of-arrays" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Output an Array and Array of Arrays
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘console.table’ provides the index on the left and indexed values or just ‘value’ across the top for array or array of arrays. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1d array with &lt;code&gt;.table() vs .log()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;namesStartingWithA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alexis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;namesStartingWithA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alexis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;namesStartingWithA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// same data as above looks like this&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alexis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2d array with &lt;code&gt;.table() vs .log()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;namesStartingWithA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alexis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;namesStartingWithA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Alexis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;       
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;                                       &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Andrew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

  Output of Objects and Arrays of Objects
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When outputting an array of objects,  the keys become headers. If the data has many values or many keys, avoid using ‘console.table()’.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#show-selected-columns-only" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Show Selected Columns Only
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to select just the column(s) you want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: ‘console.table(data, [‘columnName’])’  You do need the brackets and single quote. &lt;code&gt;[‘ ‘]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;namesStartingWithAWithId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;815&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;68&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;062&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;772&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel js-actions-panel"&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight__panel-action js-fullscreen-code-action"&gt;
    Enter fullscreen mode
    


    Exit fullscreen mode
    


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#not-recommended-on-complex-or-long-data" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Not Recommended On Complex or Long Data
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ‘console.table()’ is highly visual, long arrays or complex objects are likely harder to understand in this table format unless you specify the column(s). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#other-useful-consoletable-tidbits" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Other Useful console.table Tidbits
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Firefox, &lt;code&gt;console.table()&lt;/code&gt; displays only 1000 rows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click a header column name and the browser sorts the table based on the column data (ASC and DSC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#reference" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Reference
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table"&gt;MDN console.table&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Vim, the reason why I have come to love this particular piece of software so much, is that it can be so incredibly personal and unique for each user. I love the way that I can effectively have my own personal Vim designed by me - specifically for me. What makes this possible is the &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file can be tailored a bit at a time as my workflow changes. And my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; changes as my knowledge and my skill level, with Vim itself and with programming in general, increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past summer my 11-year-old son found a fallen tree branch, about two meters long, on the forest floor while we were camping in the mountains. He began whittling on the branch and using it as a walking stick. I watched him make some designs on the bark with his pocket knife. He took the walking stick home with him from the mountains and he continued working on it, carving more designs, whittling the wood to make a placeholder that fit his hand perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I began seeing the parallels between my son's walking stick and my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file. By editing my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file, adding plugins using &lt;a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim"&gt;Vundle&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;em&gt;Vundle itself being a brilliant plugin&lt;/em&gt; ), making leader key bindings, finding the themes that I like working with, adding all sorts of settings, tweaking just about everything - I am making it more and more practical for me. I am making the walking stick that I want to take with me on a hiking trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In customizing my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt;, Vim becomes a tool that can be any shape or colour I want it to be. And I have found that the challenge of sharpening this tool is very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From running the &lt;code&gt;vimtutor&lt;/code&gt; command for the first time ( &lt;em&gt;where you can first learn how to exit the initially weird environment that is Vim&lt;/em&gt; ) to full-on expert in your particular way of working - your &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; can change and grow - getting sharper and sharper. I like to think of the &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file ( &lt;em&gt;or other dotfiles such as &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.tmux.conf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ) as weirdly creative yet extremely practical canvases on which the growth of a software developer is inadvertently charted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I do not change and experiment with my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file in order to "chart growth". I do it because I am seeking to become a more proficient and efficient developer. But, if I were to look back at the previous versions of my dotfiles, I would definitely see growth and increased understanding. An increasing understanding of Vimscript, sure, but also of programming concepts in general. And, most importantly, the various dotfile versions chart an increased understanding of &lt;strong&gt;what works for me&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#everybody-uses-vim-differently" class="anchor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Everybody uses Vim differently.
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower"&gt;Kelsey Hightower&lt;/a&gt;, Staff Developer Advocate - Google Cloud Platform, has said publicly that he uses Vim without any plugins whatsoever. I listened to a podcast in which he explained that writing code with a simple Vim setup, without syntax highlighting enabled, helps him to focus on each line. And that sounds cool to me. While foregoing plugins is not something that I feel I want to do, the great thing about Vim is that your configuration ( &lt;em&gt;or lack of configuration&lt;/em&gt; ) is all yours to do with what you want. If you want to code with Vim out of the box without plugins and you feel that helps your work - that is great. 💯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a folder containing &lt;a href="https://github.com/papadavis47/pd47dotfiles"&gt;my dotfiles&lt;/a&gt; under version control for awhile now and this is what I see when I run &lt;code&gt;git log --oneline&lt;/code&gt; on that repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5dXxD6wI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/db6lm8zncfjmgqpbwxlv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5dXxD6wI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/db6lm8zncfjmgqpbwxlv.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one of the commits represents at least a few things I have learned to make my workflow more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, change is what my &lt;code&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; is all about. It is a living document. Experimentation is all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I work with a vim that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ql8IJAu7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hz82xzoa9n5oqk6mymvu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ql8IJAu7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hz82xzoa9n5oqk6mymvu.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0mHf6v4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/so7pwkdy7vhixo1vo2ee.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0mHf6v4A--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/so7pwkdy7vhixo1vo2ee.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try a particular plugin for awhile, and if I find it useful, then great - I have made a discovery to help my work. But if I find I do not like it, it is an easy process to uninstall it using Vundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned some very useful things through the book,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/"&gt;Learn Vimscript the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt; by Steve Losh. There is a free HTML version - or you can purchase a paper copy or an ebook through the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can not say enough about the wonderful repository,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/akrawchyk/awesome-vim"&gt;Awesome Vim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also proudly ripped off some great stuff from the repository, &lt;a href="https://github.com/amix/vimrc"&gt;The Ultimate vimrc&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, a special mention to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles"&gt;dotfiles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.benorenstein.com/"&gt;Ben Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore"&gt;Vim-Galore&lt;/a&gt; has been an amazing help. Of course, I have never taken from these open source files wholesale. I digested the changes as I went along - a bit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resources above, and many other that can be found by searching Google and GitHub, are plenty for anyone wanting help in making the most awesome walking stick - tailor made for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim is a tool that actually uses its own programming language - and a fascinating one at that. Vim source code is written in the C language - but Vimscript ( &lt;em&gt;mentioned earlier in this post&lt;/em&gt; ) is what one uses to write plugins and add functionality onto Vim. While I do not use Vimscript in my day to day work beyond customizing my Vim configuration - I quite like the challenge of learning Vimscript and slowly improving my use of it. Eventually, I will use it to write my own plugins for use in my own work. I can then share those plugins with anyone else who might be interested. If that is not a rich piece of software - I do not know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more advanced features, I like this video by &lt;a href="https://github.com/lambdalisue"&gt;Alisue Lambda&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5BX1FXnKBw"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I like these two by &lt;a href="https://ctoomey.com/"&gt;Chris Toomey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlR5gYd6um0"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwD8G1P52Sk"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of writing code with a modular editor take a bit of work and practice to realize - but are well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vim way of editing code can also be achieved and transferred to other editors - such as VS Code ( &lt;em&gt;also incredibly rich software&lt;/em&gt; ) with it's wonderful community and collection of extensions - including a terrific one called &lt;a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim"&gt;vscodevim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or to Atom - with its lightness and speed and a very well made &lt;a href="https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus"&gt;vim emulation package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use VS Code and Atom from time to time - depending on what I am working on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic Vim, VS Code, or Atom - all three are brilliant open source software. With the Vim key binding plugins available, I can keep consistency between my tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to myself&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Always be searching the forest floor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making your own walking stick is simply a better feeling than buying one. You own the tool in a way that you would not otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson I have learned for myself through making my own &lt;em&gt;programming&lt;/em&gt; walking stick?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continually find what works for me - and go with it&lt;/em&gt; 🤓&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running a Small E-Commerce-like Website for Free</title>
      <author>ngavinsir</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/ngavinsir/running-a-small-e-commerce-like-website-for-free-1cbc</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate student in one of the universities in Indonesia, we are mostly obligated to participate in a community empowerment program, where we are supposed to help the locals by applying our knowledge. Usually, we have to physically be in the community area to take part in this program, but because of the covid pandemic, the program was held online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several problems that can be solved, so we divided the tasks among multiple people. My team got a task to help the locals to promote their products and villas online. This problem is fascinating to be solved because they had tried to publish their products and villas on mainstream e-commerce platforms, but it’s not easy to comply with all the rules. So there are only a few products that can be promoted on those platforms. After several discussions with the locals and my team, we decided to launch and manage our own website to promote everything about this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we planned everything that we want to display on the website. We want to promote four types of items on the website: local crafts (sculpture, batik, wood crafts, etc.), villas, regional destinations, and vacation packages. We also experimented on the landing page’s design so that it can be attractive and appealing to potential tourists. Additionally, we added a route guide on how to get to the place by any kind of public transports (bus, angkot, motorcycle, commuter rail, etc.). The guide includes the schedule for each public transportation and the fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, we planned to host all the data that needs to be displayed on the website in a relational database (PostgreSQL) and manage the contents through a simple CMS like WordPress or a more modern CMS like Strapi. Since we have to rent a server to host those CMS, we decided to research on the alternatives that can be used for free and without the need to rent a server. After thorough exploration, we found out about git-based CMS, a CMS that utilizes a git server to store all the content information. There are several services that offer a git-based CMS system, but we chose Forestry because we think it has good UI/UX, and it’s more mature than the alternatives. Forestry stores all of the content in a Github repo, so we can have a fully working CMS for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we have to decide what technology we will use for the frontend. It’s really exciting for me to do a small project like this because I can try and validate new cutting-edge technology. Some months before, I discovered a cool talk about web reactivity by Rich Harris, the creator of the Svelte framework (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao"&gt;Rethinking Reactivity&lt;/a&gt;). Well, it’s more of a language than a framework, Rich Harris clarifies more on that &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/0f910048478c2a6505d1c32185b61934"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What makes it different than the other UI framework like React or Vue is that Svelte shifts the work of the runtime in the browser into a compile step that happens when you build your app. So, Svelte apps can come with drastically smaller bundle sizes than the others because there is no overhead for the framework runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdNJ3fydeao"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we want the website to be easily discoverable by SEO, there are two technologies to choose from: server-side rendered (SSR) website or statically generated website. Then, I stumble upon a relatively new paradigm called Jamstack. Jamstack is a web architecture consisting of a Javascript framework, Static Site Generator, Headless CMS, and Content Delivery Network (CDN). The term was first popularized by Matt Biilmann, the CEO of Netlify. So, we landed on Sapper, a framework based on Svelte; it’s kind of like Next.js to React or Nuxt.js to Vue. Sapper supports two types of build; server-side rendered and statically generated. So, these are the website’s tech stack:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sapper (Static Site Generator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forestry (Headless CMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vercel (CDN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this is really awesome because we can run a small e-commerce kind of website for free. Every time the admin updates the content through the CMS, Forestry will update the file that stored the specific content, located in the Github repo. Then, Vercel will detect the commit and rebuild the website by respecting all the new updates. This way, the website will be fast to load because it’s statically generated, and potential customers can quickly discover the website through the search engine. We think SEO is critical for marketing, so we care deeply about this and optimize it extensively until it reaches the score of 100 at &lt;a href="https://www.web.dev/measure"&gt;web.dev/measure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Sapper is fantastic because it’s based on Svelte and it’s more mature than the alternatives. But there is a catch, it’s still in early development, so it’s not stable yet and not recommended for a big serious project. The one key feature that’s missing is incremental static regeneration, which is available on the Next.js framework. I think it’s essential for a website with a significant number of pages. If there is no incremental static regeneration, you have to rebuild the whole website every time you want to update some content on the website. Imagine, if you have 100k page on your website, it will take forever just to update one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing that needs to be figured out is image storage. There must be at least one image to showcase a product, so this is important for an e-commerce-like website. Then, we discover Cloudinary, which is also promoted by Forestry. It’s incredible because the free plan is very generous. The website barely used 33% of the limit. You can also alter the image’s size on the fly by putting the appropriate setting on the image’s URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework, for the styling part of the website. I already used it before on a previous project, and I’m delighted with the workflow because it’s convenient to use, and it’s really easy to keep the design consistent. It’s created by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger. They are the author of the Refactoring UI book, which I think is a must-read for every front-end developers because it’s really concise and beautifully written. If you can’t buy the book, you can read a sneak peek of it on this &lt;a href="https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886"&gt;medium article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
