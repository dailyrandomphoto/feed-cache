      <guid>https://dev.to/qablehq/7-features-that-need-to-be-tested-in-e-commerce-website-2nfk</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to check every aspect of an eCommerce website to not compromise on important factors like user experience, security, and quick loading time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of your eCommerce website depends on determining which features to test in an e-commerce website, providing seamless performance without having any errors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can give your customers the best shopping experience if your e-Shop is working efficiently. Thus, seven important eCommerce website features list need to be tested in an eCommerce website to ensure uninterrupted performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-testing-ecommerce-website-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Testing eCommerce website structure
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eCommerce website structure consists of different pages, including Main pages, category pages, product descriptions, and shopping cart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tester needs to check the main pages, including the home page, the product pages, site map, privacy policy, return policy and Special offer page. All pages are crucial when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.qable.io/e-commerce-testing-service/"&gt;eCommerce website features testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-testing-ecommerce-website-workflow"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Testing eCommerce website workflow
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The testing of the entire workflow of your e-commerce web / mobile application includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login and signup options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product review posting feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting facility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply filters to select the desired product (s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add/remove functionality to shopping cart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order number and invoice generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payment Gateway and Payment Processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-testing-payment-gateway-integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Testing Payment gateway integration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the important things to &lt;a href="https://www.qable.io/e-commerce-testing-service/"&gt;test in an ecommerce website&lt;/a&gt; is to check the payment gateway. You will have to do many tests to make sure it works properly and provides security when conducting online transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the checkout and payment process you need to test:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The correct price of the product, shipping charge, VAT, discount code all apply to you, and the customer has to pay the correct amount. You can test this payment process by editing the final list of products, applying different discount coupon codes, and selecting a different area to see changes in shipping charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to check if the payment has been processed properly using all payment methods like Net Banking, Credit / Debit Card, PayPal etc. Also, you need to check that the order has been cancelled and the payment ID has been returned. You can see all this using dummy accounts and demo debit/credit card numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check whether invoices and emails generated after the payment process have been sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also need to ensure that the refund process, email and refund receipt are all working properly to complete the eCommerce website features testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-security-and-vulnerability-assessment"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Security and vulnerability assessment
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce applications contain valuable information (customer’s personal and banking data), so you need to perform security tests to check security and vulnerability issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use testing methods such as SQL injection, ethical hacks on login, registration, payment gateway, and other pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-checking-compatibility-with-web-browser"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Checking compatibility with web browser
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The e-commerce application needs to work on all web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to check the app’s browser compatibility to ensure that your customers can use your e-commerce website without hassle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-testing-for-mobile-response"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Testing for Mobile Response
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, mobile devices occupy the desktop platform in terms of internet access, and companies are adopting a mobile-first strategy in their eCommerce website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to test the responsive design of your application on mobile devices of different screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#7-checking-performance-and-seo-related-matters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  7. Checking performance and SEO related matters
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last essential thing to test in an ecommerce website is to verify the performance of your website/application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to perform performance testing on parameters like webpage loading speed, throughput, data transfer rate, efficiency, uptime, database performance, website traffic load tolerance, error message etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to make your e-commerce website high search engine visibility to get enough user traffic to your site. You can do this by applying search engine optimization (SEO) to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to check if the SEO strategy like title tag, meta description, URL structure, image alt tag etc., is implemented properly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life at AWS : 8th Anniversary</title>
      <author>Rohini Gaonkar</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 03:43:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/aws/life-at-aws-8th-anniversary-2pk1</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/aws/life-at-aws-8th-anniversary-2pk1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;8 years ago, 7th January 2014, I joined Amazon Web Services (AWS) and this blog is a peek into the dream-come-true life I have had so far. These are some of the learnings, experiences and thoughts on life at AWS. If you are new to AWS or aspire to join us, read along! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have been a Cloud Support Engineer(CSE), a Solutions Architect(SA) and a Developer Advocate(DA) across South Africa, Singapore and India. I have moved with AWS to different geographies, and made friends globally. I got to work with hundreds of customers in different regions, and many more colleagues who have become really good friends. Meeting them in different countries has been pure joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y_s6n1-B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/umrfldz49aqwcgux91te.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y_s6n1-B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/umrfldz49aqwcgux91te.png" alt="Over the years, I have been a Cloud Support Engineer, a Solutions Architect and a Developer Advocate in South Africa, Singapore and India" width="880" height="390"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many organizations frown upon people leaving teams/projects, here at AWS we are &lt;strong&gt;encouraged to explore different roles&lt;/strong&gt;. I could apply my tech skills as a Support Engineer while expanding my breadth and dive deeper into services. I used those learnings to help customers as a Solutions Architect(SA). As an SA I followed my passion of public speaking and worked with AWS community over the weekends, which led to eventually moving into Developer Advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJ6bth2TNDw"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#a-little-history-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  A little history :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I joined AWS I was part of an R&amp;amp;D team that did Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) on different cloud platforms we had back in 2010. Most of those public/private clouds do not exist today.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was love at first sight, with AWS technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with AWS tech before launch of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and AWS AutoScaling for Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). It led to an idea and a working PoC  which resulted into my first published &lt;strong&gt;IEEE paper&lt;/strong&gt;. Interested? Read &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6701474"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, I had hands-on migrations experience of moving on-premise web applications to AWS - a highly coveted skill at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organization was acquired and its vision changed, but my love for AWS and my vision stayed strong. So, I applied to AWS, went through virtual interviews and did the unthinkable - moved to different continent - Cape Town, South Africa. In the middle of culture shock and home sickness, my tech skills soared higher every passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BOl5MVb4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p1qydwrcafhvzexztr4.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BOl5MVb4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7p1qydwrcafhvzexztr4.jpg" alt='"The growth that I see in myself personally and professionally, has been tremendous, and that is the biggest motivation for me at AWS - working together to build a better tomorrow."' width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;
  &lt;a href="#source-my-feature-in-the-aws-employee-spotlight-series"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Source : My feature in the AWS Employee Spotlight series.
&lt;/h6&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#learnings-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Learnings :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While everyone talks about &lt;strong&gt;Leadership Principles&lt;/strong&gt;, which we Amazonians imbibe in every aspect of our work, I wanted to shed some light on other aspects of working at AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I tell new joiners, or people who even change roles/location internally - initially, it feels like a lot of information is sent your way and its only natural to feel overwhelmed. &lt;strong&gt;Drinking from the firehose.&lt;/strong&gt; When you feel like it, remember what Dory said - &lt;strong&gt;just keep swimming&lt;/strong&gt;. Trust me, it does get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, don't rush through your ramp up time. There is a reason ramp up time is provided, use it well to learn the internal ways, do your certifications and most importantly shadow your colleagues in different roles. Everyone is busy, but if you need help - ASK! Find a buddy, or a mentor, it will help calm your nerves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us experience &lt;strong&gt;imposter syndrome&lt;/strong&gt; It may feel overwhelming to be around so many smart individuals. AWS has a high hiring bar, if you made it through it, you are worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be successful at AWS you have to take &lt;strong&gt;ownership&lt;/strong&gt; of projects beyond your daily responsibilities. It is a great way to connect with the global AWS teams, customers and helps you build relationships. Over the years, I am proud having worked with some amazing teams here at AWS - from being part of the &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is my Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to managing 21 sessions across 3 theatres for Lightning talks in a &lt;strong&gt;physical AWS Summit India&lt;/strong&gt;, to owning a T&amp;amp;C &lt;a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/global-traincert-twitch-lets-ship-it-with-aws.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, getting my customers speaking slots at re:Invent, building workshops, and many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons of my life - &lt;strong&gt;Burnout is real&lt;/strong&gt;. Some interviewees ask a question - &lt;em&gt;is life at AWS too hectic?&lt;/em&gt; Well IT depends on what stresses you (and sometimes which team you are in). Here, we are not stressed by office politics, you are not worried of racing with your colleague to get that promotion. Here, everyone has more than enough work to showcase their skills. When you are so excited about the work you do, you may end up not realizing you are burning out. And it's important to pace it. There is a saying internally - &lt;strong&gt;it's a Marathon, not a sprint&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it's important to know your own limits, take breaks, talk to your managers if something is troubling you. There are multiple programs available to employees, and I have used them last year when our lives changed overnight. It has helped me tremendously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone works on schedules that make sense to them.  &lt;strong&gt;You set your own boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Saying NO is encouraged by leaders. You would find leaders saying - just because you saw an email from me that is out of business hours, doesn't mean you have to respond immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this would not have been possible without some amazing managers &amp;amp; leaders. &lt;strong&gt;A good manager is a blessing.&lt;/strong&gt; They have always pushed me to speak up, to be a leader, motivated me when I doubted myself or just being a friend I can freely talk to. I have never hesitated to reach out to skip level or regional managers. It is never considered as an escalation, but a pure sharing of ideas and building relationships. Coming from a very hierarchical past this was the warmest welcome. Being an autonomous individual contributor has boosted my motivation and creativity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6v6rxUhC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1jzwqplq2ymhisws1wy.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6v6rxUhC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l1jzwqplq2ymhisws1wy.jpeg" alt="“During my initial years here, when I was too shy to speak up and share my ideas in meetings, my managers always ensured I felt heard. Managers at AWS are more like approachable leaders than a typical boss.”" width="880" height="461"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h6&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#summary-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Summary :
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life at AWS has had its ups and downs, a dream-come-true  rollercoaster ride. It is AWSome because of all the amazing people I have met as colleagues, customers or community. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🤔 What Suggestions Do You Have for this Discord Server?</title>
      <author>William McGonagle</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the Fairfield Programming Association, we're going to be launching a Discord server. But, we really want your feedback about how you think the server should function and what features you want. We have one of the best bot programmers that there is working on our discord bot, but we don't want the server to be an average one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we thought that we should get feedback from you guys about what you like about the server and what you would change. Also, if you have any features you would suggest, please let me know, I would love to hear them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://discord.gg/r2JnDXvrWt"&gt;You can see the server here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lack of Motivation</title>
      <author>Reece Barker</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 03:07:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/brakysco/lack-of-motivation-p59</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/brakysco/lack-of-motivation-p59</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you but I sure lack motivation to work on projects and just get out of bed sometimes, most of us struggle with anxiety, depression and even acute mental disorders, but the one thing that seems to keep us going is a reconnection with the world around us, I want to tell you all a little story of how I found my motivation back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by "little story" I really mean it, I didn't really know it at the time I was just living life as I usually did and then it hit me, the depression and lack of motivation to even get on the computer, being stuck in a cycle of wake up, watch tv, eat and sleep. I found myself stuck in a hole that at the time to be honest I didn't really care if I came out of that hole or not, however, what changed after the months of depression and anxiety to even leave the house, was a trip I took back home, you see I live in Germany, quite far away from my home in England, and this trip back home did something that changed my whole life that I had been living for months and it opened my eyes and I found new and old passions for things I love and hate, I found new and exciting things to do and I managed to change my life for better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know many people out there suffer in even worse conditions maybe even in the same conditions as I did, and my point here is that not everyone is living their lives without anxiety and depression, everyone and I mean EVERYONE, is just as troubled as you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GO (also called Golang) is an in-demand programming language, especially for people working with Google products. Go is used by many big companies, like Uber Medium, Dropbox, Salesforce, Netflix, IBM, and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For job seekers of all levels, Go is a fantastic option. But where do you begin? What information do you require? Today, we’ll talk about the ideal way to learn Go and build a strong portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Golang developer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang (also called Go) is a &lt;strong&gt;statically typed, compiled programming language&lt;/strong&gt; that was developed by Google in 2009. The language combines the efficiency of C++ efficiency and the readability of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why it’s sometimes hard to make a choice; either there are too few options to choose from, or there are too many. When it comes to programming languages, there is an embarrassment of riches, which in turn can cause mental gridlock. There’s Python, Java, JavaScript, C/CPP, PHP, Swift, C#, Ruby, Objective-C, and SQL, and that’s not even the full list! How do you choose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, bear in mind that as far as programmers go, there’s no such thing as knowing too many languages. A programmer with a grasp of many languages is a programmer who is highly marketable and very much in demand. Upskilling is always a smart way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/techsolutionstuff/laravel-8-import-export-csvexcel-file-example-2kcg</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will give you laravel 8 import export csv and excel file example. We will simple create import data to xls, csv file and also we will import data to database using csv file in laravel 8 application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using maatwebsiteexcel laravel 8 example you can easily import and export csv and excel file. For laravel 8 import csv/excel file use import class, laravel 8 export csv/excel file use export class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this example we can easily import and export and download the csv &amp;amp; excel file from the database using the maatwebsite/excel composer package.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maatwebsite/excel provide easy way to import and export csv file in laravel 8 using database model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's start how to import csv and excel file in laravel 8.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Step 1 : Create new project in laravel 8

Step 2 : Database Setup

Step 3 : Install Package

Step 4 : Create Some Dummy Records Using Tinker

Step 5 : Create New Route

Step 6 : Add Controller

Step 7 : Create Import Class

Step 8 : Create Export Class

Step 9 : Create Blade File for View
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What's Difference Between Unit Test and Integration Test</title>
      <author>ChunTing Wu</author>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 01:34:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lazypro/whats-difference-between-unit-test-and-integration-test-l2p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lazypro/whats-difference-between-unit-test-and-integration-test-l2p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed there are many engineers cannot distinguish between the unit test and integration test. Even though these two tests are as different as their names, we still cannot use them in the right place. This article helps you understand them and use them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to explain them better, I recommend &lt;a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/dependency-injection-in-javascript-the-best-tool-youre-not-using-for-your-tests-4e83aca7579f"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which introduce the dependency injection to the unit tests to achieve more testing coverage rate. I will leverage the example in it and dive into the integration test further. Before talking about the integration test, let's take a quick look at the relationship between the unit test and the dependency injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#unit-test-and-dependency-injection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Unit Test and Dependency Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes a function, aka an unit, saveData.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;saveData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/** 
    Call 'q' to execute the db query
    Call 'con' to connect to the database
    */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;insert into mydatabase.mytable (data) value ('&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There was a problem saving your data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, we need to verify both the success case and failure case to achieve complete test coverage within the unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can leverage the dependency injection to prune the external dependency from a database.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Unit Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;should return true if the data is saved into the database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;saveData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hi there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;should return an error object if the data is not saved into the database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;saveData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;hi there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;con&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="na"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;There was a problem saving your data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the above examples, we fake the database objects and make sure our business logic is correct. The keyword is "business logic". We verify the whole business logic in unit tests no matter what database is. By using the dependency injection, we can easily verify the business logic and reach a high coverage rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#integration-test"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Integration Test
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, we have already ensure the unit works without the database. The things are not likely to go so smoothly after the database is involving. Thus, we have to make some integration tests to verify the database works as our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already verified the units, therefore, we can only verify the database part, i.e &lt;code&gt;"insert into mydatabase.mytable (data) value ('" + data +"')"&lt;/code&gt; as follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Integration Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;should save data in database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;strQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;insert into mydatabase.mytable (data) value ('hello world')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;strQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;equal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This example is not structured well, because we can apply the layered architecture to build an abstraction upon SQL query, called DAL (data access layer). Hence, we can have a cleaner interface to test the database instead of using raw SQL in a test case. Moreover, in Domain-Driven Develop, there is a similar pattern, Repository, and it provides an encapsulation for the database access. Those methods are able to provide convenience for writing integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you can replace the dependency injection with other techniques like mocking. However, in my opinion, mocking will introduce much more implement efforts on writing the integration tests. By using the dependency injection, we will have an independent module/object/interface for the integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should we distinguish between the unit test and integration test? The reason is doing integration tests will take a lot of time, most of the time from the database access. Suppose an integration test case take 100 ms, which is very fast for the database access, then it is hard for us to write thousands of test cases. In order to fully test a system, we always try to cover every decision in every function from every file, thus, controlling total time consuming is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why Testing Pyramid shows the bottom is the unit test, and the integration test is up on it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lzCfo0Y---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/Mf5nC7V.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lzCfo0Y---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.imgur.com/Mf5nC7V.png" alt="" width="300" height="233"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize what is the main difference between unit tests and integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are made for testing business logic; on the other hand, integration tests are for verifying the external dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With messing up the scenes, it will end up spending more effort and getting less results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you've heard the name Vue.js, at least I assume so otherwise you wouldn't be here. Also you might have heard how powerful, yet simple it is. In this post, which is the first on in a series of posts about Vue.js, I'll show you the basic steps to get started with Vue.js, and print the message we all look forward to seeing, the glorious "Hello, world!".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start by creating a file named &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and import Vue in the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; tag like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we can use Vue, let's use Vue's template syntax to render our message:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ message }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that here we have a special syntax which is different from our usual html: &lt;code&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/code&gt;. Here we are just rendering the value of variable named &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; exactly where the template is placed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All we need to now is to create an instance of Vue and attach it to our HTML tag. To reference the tag I've given it an arbitrary id &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt;. Let's do this by creating a file named &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;#app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this code we have created a new instance of Vue, have specified an element to attach to, and the data that is available to be used in our templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth mentioning that &lt;code&gt;#app&lt;/code&gt; refers to an html element with the id of &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
As the last step we just import &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; lin our html page. Just make sure you import it right before your closing &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is all we need to render our message with Vue and this is how our complete &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2/dist/vue.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"app"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ message }}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"./index.js"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our code ready, let's deploy it on  &lt;a href="https://www.utopiops.com"&gt;utopiops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;code&gt;Fully managed applications&lt;/code&gt; section as we want to use free static website deployment and hosting that Utopiops offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wlfj9OJW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640944738538/QMMZQKUtp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Wlfj9OJW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640944738538/QMMZQKUtp.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-31 at 8.16.15 pm.png" width="291" height="939"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we choose &lt;code&gt;Static website&lt;/code&gt; as the application type to be created. (Utopiops also offers free plans for &lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Dockerized&lt;/code&gt; applications)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7WK9BeMu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640944848567/j_pE1HukP.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7WK9BeMu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640944848567/j_pE1HukP.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-31 at 8.16.35 pm.png" width="717" height="318"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the only thing we need to know is to specify the  &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkamrani/alpinejs-helloworld-utopiops"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;  that we store our code (Utopiops supports Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember we don't need to provide any build command!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gLLADeES--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641517871517/Cgn_KwzFD.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gLLADeES--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641517871517/Cgn_KwzFD.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-07 at 12.11.04 pm.png" width="880" height="389"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it, in a few seconds we have our website ready and every time we make a change to our code it automatically deploys our changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vuejs-hello-world-e9d16563.sites.utopiops.com"&gt;https://vuejs-hello-world-e9d16563.sites.utopiops.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Utopiops is in public beta at the time of writing this post and the view you see when you log in to Utopiops at &lt;a href="https://www.utopiops.com"&gt;https://www.utopiops.com&lt;/a&gt; might be different, but the good news is that it sure just have become more user-friendly and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code  &lt;a href="https://github.com/mkamrani/alpinejs-helloworld-utopiops"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
