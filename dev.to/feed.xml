      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you're a developer who works with designers, you're already familiar with the infamous "handoff" – that point in the workflow when you start turning wireframes and mockups into code. Even if you're not personally familiar with the process, it's probably unsurprising to hear that this can be a real pain point. This pain can be lessened, however, when both sides have an understanding of what the other will be looking for in the handoff process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designers are expected to have a pretty thorough understanding of the front-end web: HTML elements, the CSS box model, how responsive resizing works, component-based structure, etc. And yet, when we flip the script, developers are rarely expected to have an understanding of design basics – what's up with that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, &lt;strong&gt;Figma Kits&lt;/strong&gt; are becoming a more popular offering for teams using a third-party component library. For example, this &lt;a href="https://www.telerik.com/figma-kits"&gt;Figma Kit from KendoUI&lt;/a&gt; which offers all their components, broken down into base elements and ready for customization in Figma. When you use one of these, you get the benefit of being &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; synced up with your designers...but, to make fullest use of a tool like that, you'll want to know your way around Figma – at least a little.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teams work better and create better products when both parties have a high level understanding of each others' tools and priorities.&lt;/strong&gt; Not to mention all the ways having access to the design source files can make your own job easier. With that in mind, I'd love to introduce my developer friends to &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most popular and widely-used UI design tools. It's free for individual use, so I'd encourage you to go make an account and start playing around! It's the best way to learn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any specialized software, a Figma file can be a little overwhelming to navigate if you're not familiar with it. So let's start from the top and take a look at the the basics, along with the Figma features that will be most useful for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#figma-file-organization"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Figma File Organization
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figma files are organized by &lt;strong&gt;Pages&lt;/strong&gt; (think screens of your application), which each contain &lt;strong&gt;Frames&lt;/strong&gt; (subpages, often used to organize mockups of Pages in various user interaction states). Each Frame is made up of &lt;strong&gt;Elements&lt;/strong&gt; – shapes, text, vectors, etc. Elements (or groups of Elements) can be saved as reusable &lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt;. Elements are customized with &lt;strong&gt;Styles&lt;/strong&gt;, like colors or fonts. Styles (or groups of Styles) can be saved as &lt;strong&gt;Design Tokens&lt;/strong&gt; and organized into shareable &lt;strong&gt;Libraries **&lt;/strong&gt;for easy reuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OPfzmm0l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t34r75ff2wi1xv1y9rbc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OPfzmm0l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t34r75ff2wi1xv1y9rbc.png" alt="Figma Design home screen" width="880" height="573"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-oriented"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Oriented
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first open a Figma file, this is what you'll see: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;center panel&lt;/strong&gt; shows the current Page contents. Clicking on any Element will select it, in both the left and right sidebars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;left sidebar&lt;/strong&gt; is where you'll find the document structure, organized into a nested and layered view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;right sidebar&lt;/strong&gt; has three main sections – &lt;strong&gt;Design, Prototype,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Inspect&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt; allows the designer to adjust the Styles on each Element. The contents of this tab will change based on which Element is selected (colors, borders, etc. for shapes, font choices, sizes, etc. for text).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Prototype&lt;/strong&gt; allows the designer to hook all the Frames together into a clickable prototype.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Inspect&lt;/strong&gt; summarizes the selected content into CSS properties and code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q81NfBXK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ug6vh5f720540uv5bmf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q81NfBXK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2ug6vh5f720540uv5bmf.png" alt="Figma Prototype Screen" width="880" height="456"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should Developers Care?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The Prototype tool is a great way to do user testing and validate ideas before devs write a single line of code. This not only saves dev time by allowing designers to make adjustments to the UI before the development phase (and what's not to love about that?), but user testing at this stage &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; offers devs the opportunity to sit down with a designer and a user before they start building. When devs can see user motivations and pain points happening in real time &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; be involved in user conversations early in the process, it makes for a much more intuitive and cohesive product. This helps shift the development cycle from &lt;strong&gt;reactive&lt;/strong&gt; ("We have to fix this thing we got a lot of negative feedback about") to &lt;strong&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt; ("We saw during testing that users struggled with this task, so let's put extra attention into streamlining it"). Not to mention, just being able to explore the prototype whenever you like means you never have to wonder "Wait, what's supposed to happen when they click this button?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to take a closer look at the details of a mockup, you can turn on the &lt;strong&gt;Grids&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl+G,&lt;/strong&gt; which will help you get a feel for the spacing and structure of what you're building. You can also toggle on &lt;strong&gt;Rulers&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Shift+R,&lt;/strong&gt; and show &lt;strong&gt;spacing values between elements&lt;/strong&gt; by selecting the Element and &lt;strong&gt;holding down the Option key while you hover&lt;/strong&gt; over the items around it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#exporting-assets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Exporting Assets
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so you've explored the file and you feel like you've got a solid understanding of what needs to be built and why. Time to start writing some code. Good news – Figma also makes this easier! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defining your high-level styles, you'll want the contents of the Libraries – those Design Tokens are the recurring CSS values that you'll want to turn into variables and/or assign to properties in your global stylesheet. If you select the highest level Page from the left-hand sidebar, the Design Tokens will appear in the right-hand sidebar. You can click on the knobs icon of each one to inspect it and see all the details you'll need to recreate it in your CSS files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aLcMhmi2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ts7tbeetrla82k43u9s3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aLcMhmi2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ts7tbeetrla82k43u9s3.png" alt="A Figma Design Token" width="880" height="647"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there's no native way in Figma for you to export those Libraries...fortunately, there are a handful of third-party Figma plugins that you can add to do it for you! My recommendation is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.telerik.com/unite-ux"&gt;Unite UX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which really makes it a piece of cake. If you download &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/969582819918741496/Unite-UX"&gt;the Figma plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you can export all the data from the Figma file into Unite UX, check the design against your code, and then export your final styling files from Unite UX. That Unite UX export package will include a ton of useful SASS files (one of which being '_tokens.scss') that you can add directly to your project. Boom, done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should Developers Care?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
No more copying and pasting styles! No more trying to come up with unique variable names, only to find out the design team is calling the same thing something completely different! No more trying to match padding values just by staring back and forth between some exported PDF and your browser until they start to look similar! Whew, I'm exhausted just writing all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get past the high-level styles and into the nitty-gritty, that's where the Inspect tool in Figma's right sidebar is going to be your new best friend. Much like the inspect tool in every major browser, Inspect lets you drill down on a single Element and get all the details – helpfully formatted into CSS properties. You can get this info either as a list of properties, or as automatically generated code, both of which have quick copy options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SchNRok6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jnvklpvbe94q7wma9ppu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SchNRok6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jnvklpvbe94q7wma9ppu.png" alt="The Figma Inspect tool" width="783" height="629"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should Developers Care?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The Inspect tool is where Figma really shines for devs, by summarizing styles into CSS properties and even code snippets! As always, it's not wise to blindly copy and paste machine-generated code, but this is super useful as a jumping off point to tweak and adjust. Leaps and bounds better than starting from scratch, using some kind of color-picker tool, or (&lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt;) attempting to match values by eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if there are any images or custom icons in the mockup, you'll want those exported as well. Ideally, your designers will have marked the assets you need as &lt;strong&gt;Exportable&lt;/strong&gt; – if this is the case, then you can select the Page or Frame that you want to export items from, open the &lt;strong&gt;Export Panel&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Cmd+Shift+E,&lt;/strong&gt; and export everything that they've marked from one place. If not, you'll have to export assets one at a time. Select whatever you want to export and scroll down in the right sidebar until you see the &lt;strong&gt;Export&lt;/strong&gt; section. There, you can customize your size and export file type (PNG, SVG, JPG, or PDF), and click the Export button right below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dItw7COU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/moks1eb1nj61n0dp626z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dItw7COU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/moks1eb1nj61n0dp626z.png" alt="The Figma Export tool" width="516" height="280"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should Developers Care?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
How many times have you had to put a project on hold in order to DM designers (who are probably busy with something else) and ask them to send you the assets you need? And then when you finally get those assets, you discover that they're not high enough resolution, or you're still missing something, or they've been exported as JPGs instead of...well, literally &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; else? Forget the back and forth, and instead feel confident getting what you need, when you need it, straight from the source files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ease-the-pain-of-the-handoff"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ease the pain of the handoff
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design / dev handoff doesn't have to be a pain point if both groups are willing to meet each other halfway. There are plenty of great products that have taken strides towards bridging this gap, but at the end of the day, even the best tool is only useful if you have a contextual understanding of what you're doing with it. You don't need to have a deep understanding of design concepts to benefit from getting comfortable with Figma. When developers are empowered to explore and work with the actual design source files, everybody wins!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Was Betrayed By Computer Science Students</title>
      <author>Naufan Rusyda Faikar</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:39:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/naruaika/i-was-betrayed-by-computer-science-students-244j</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/naruaika/i-was-betrayed-by-computer-science-students-244j</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Convenience, she never guaranteed to make life better. It may seem so, but it is not real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, I have called by a lecturer of mine from the last two semesters. It was not a direct call, but rather someone had came to me for saying that. I believed on her, for my lecture that one and several others have put their trust in me, specially in teaching my juniors. But that day happened to be my senior ... I know exactly, everyone has a tendency of doing what is destined to. But, if they do not even try, what is the point of being students? Of being computer science students?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse, one of our junior lecture told, "If you cannot code, you can always do this and that." You know, I am not upset, rather I am so sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that a computer student must know how to code. It does not matter at all if they end up not mastering all the implementations, but at least they shall get the basic ideas behind doing the code. It will surely be achieved by itself through efforts and struggles in the learning process. It will not be cheap though, never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am used to, being the leader of a study group, from elementary to college. It was indeed such a disaster, since I was not expecting it at all. I would say that neither I am good at it nor I am passionate, but I became enjoyed by time. From there, I have learned a lot how to teach friends my age. I became able to say who only has a desire to learn, who is willing to put in the effort, and who is learning by compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the prior experiences, I bet everyone can tell whether she wanted to be helped in study or in doing her thesis. With every added minute, I was getting more and more clueless as to what I should do to help. I did not want her parents to find out the three and a half years she spent in class was not worth the tuition fees. Although I kept myself to help her gently until my class break time was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, I should have to think of this. I know that this cannot be completely resolved. But at the very least, one has to keep fighting for this, no matter where one is. And I know, some have been involved in this war, a war against laziness and ignorance. This is not the culture of our people, this is just a widespread misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I realised that I might have been wrong. People may suffered a lot during the learning process, but I smugly said they were not trying. Judging only by their accomplishments. Effort may not bring a charter, but it can change a person into a better person. Being a computer science student for three and a half years may have turned her from an introvert to a person who is not shy asking her junior for help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Property-Based Testing In Go</title>
      <author>Adam Gordon Bell</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:31:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/adamgordonbell/property-based-testing-in-go-48kb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/adamgordonbell/property-based-testing-in-go-48kb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted your unit tests written for you? Property based testing is a powerful testing technique that, in a sense, is just that. You describe the properties you’d like to test, and the specific cases are generated for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property-based testing can be a bit trickier to learn, and not every problem can be well tested in this manner, but it’s a powerful technique that’s well supported by the go std-lib (&lt;code&gt;testing/quick&lt;/code&gt;) and that is under-utilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#testing-raw-csvquote-endraw-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Testing &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; is a small program that makes it easier to deal with CSV files at the command line. It does this by replacing problematic CSV characters with the controls characters &lt;code&gt;\x1e&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\x1f&lt;/code&gt; and later removing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;csvquote | head | csvquote -u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I want to improve it a bit, but first, I want to add some testing to ensure I don’t break it. The tests will also help me document how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my initial test cases:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var tests = []struct {
 in string
 out string
}{
 {`"a","b"`, `"a","b"`}, // Simple
 {"\"a,\",\"b\"", "\"a\x1f\",\"b\""}, //Comma
 {"\"a\n\",\"b\"", "\"a\x1e\",\"b\""}, //New Line
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test that the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; string always results in the &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt;, I do the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func TestSubstitute(t *testing.T) {
 f := substituteNonprintingChars(',', '"', '\n')
 for _, tt := range tests {
  out := string([]byte(apply([]byte(tt.in), f)))
  assert.Equal(t, tt.out, out, "input and output should match")
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;substituteNonprintingChars&lt;/code&gt; returns a function that does the conversion and &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; is a helper for applying that function over a &lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly simplified, it looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func apply(data []byte, f mapper) []byte {
 count := len(data)

 for i := 0; i &amp;lt; count; i++ {
  data[i] = f(data[i])
 }
 return data
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second thing I want to test is that I can reverse this operation. That is, when &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; is run with &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt;, it should always return the original input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can test this by going in reverse from output to input:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func TestRestore(t *testing.T) {
 f := restoreOriginalChars(',', '\n')
 for _, tt := range tests {
  in := string([]byte(apply([]byte(tt.out), f)))
  assert.Equal(t, tt.in, in, "input and output should match")
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;restoreOriginalChars&lt;/code&gt; is the function that restores the string to its original form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these tests pass (the full source is &lt;a href="https://github.com/adamgordonbell/csvquote/blob/7f4698ad3d3c2d12f063b5d8a8bd304e8307a089/cmd/cvsquote/main_test.go"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). However, it’s still possible there are edge cases that work incorrectly. What I need is a way to generate more test cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#propertybased-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Property-Based Testing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I could improve my testing is to combine the two tests. That is, rather than testing that the substituted value matches expectations and that the restored value matches expectations, I can simply test that substituting and restoring a string always results in the original string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is for almost all possible values of the string &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo a | csvquote | csvquote -u == a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my go test, I can state that property like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func doesIdentityHold(in string) bool {
 substitute := substituteNonprintingChars(',', '"', '\n')
 restore := restoreOriginalChars(',', '\n')
 substituted := apply([]byte(in), substitute)
 restored := string([]byte(apply(substituted, restore)))
 return in == restored
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is, for a string &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;, substituting and then restoring it should equal itself. I’m calling this &lt;code&gt;doesIdentityHold&lt;/code&gt; because an identity is any function that returns the original result. &lt;code&gt;csvquote | csvquote -u&lt;/code&gt; should be an identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#quick-check"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Quick Check
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that function, we can use &lt;code&gt;testing/quick&lt;/code&gt;, the property-based testing library, to test it:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func TestIdentity1(t *testing.T) {
 if err := quick.Check(doesIdentityHold, nil); err != nil {
  t.Error(err)
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default, this will cause &lt;code&gt;testing/quick&lt;/code&gt; to run 100 iterations of my identity test, using random strings as inputs. You can bump that up much higher, like so:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func TestIdentity1(t *testing.T) {
 c := quick.Config{MaxCount: 1000000} // &amp;lt;- changed
  if err := quick.Check(doesIdentityHold, &amp;amp;c); err != nil {
  t.Error(err)
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And with that number of tests cases, I run into a problem:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- FAIL: TestIdentity1 (5.17s)
    main_test.go:43: #13072: failed on input "\x1f\U00037f8b\U000732a1\"
FAIL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The failing test is helpfully printed. However, it’s found a problem in my testing method, not with the code under test. You see, &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; should always be able to reverse it’s input, &lt;em&gt;except in the case that the input contains the non-printable ASCII control characters&lt;/em&gt; and that is what this test case has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\x1f&lt;/code&gt; may not be used much outside of traditional teletype terminals but I asked &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; to check across all possible strings, and eventually, it found a failing case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long term, I should adjust &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; to exit with an error condition when it receives input it can’t handle, but that is a problem for another day. Instead let’s focus on constraining the input used in the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#writing-a-property-testing-generator"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Writing a Property Testing Generator
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve shown above, &lt;code&gt;testing/quick&lt;/code&gt; can generate test values for testing on its own, but it’s often valuable to write your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, writing my own CSV file generator will allow me to make a couple of improvements to the test. First of all, I can remove control characters from the test set. But also, I can move to generating strings that are valid CSV files, rather than just random characters. Testing with random characters is easy, but my main concern is that &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; can handle valid CSV files, so by narrowing in on that case, I’ll have a better chance of catching real-world issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I write a function to generate random strings of size &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; and from the character set &lt;code&gt;alphabet&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func RandString(r *rand.Rand, size int, alphabet string) string {
 var buffer bytes.Buffer
 for i := 0; i &amp;lt; size; i++ {
  index := r.Intn(len(alphabet))
  buffer.WriteString(string(alphabet[index]))
 }
 return buffer.String()
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It outputs what I expect:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;r := rand.Rand{}
println(RandString(&amp;amp;r, 5, "abc"))
println(RandString(&amp;amp;r, 5, "abc"))

caccb
cabbb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then I used that to generate a CSV files with random number or lines and rows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func randCSV(r *rand.Rand) string {
 var sb strings.Builder
 lines := r.Intn(20) + 1
 rows := r.Intn(20) + 1
 for i := 0; i &amp;lt; lines; i++ {
  for j := 0; j &amp;lt; rows; j++ {
   if j != 0 {
    sb.WriteString(`,`)
   }
   sb.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(`"%s"`, randCSVString(r)))
  }
  sb.WriteString("\n")
 }
 return sb.String()
}

func randCSVString(r *rand.Rand) string {
 s := RandString(r, 20, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01233456789,\"")
 return strings.Replace(s, `"`, `""`, -1) // In CSV all double quotes must be doubled up
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is what calling &lt;code&gt;randCSVString&lt;/code&gt; will generate:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"7IWvdDEGTxlRdJZrc4Ra","LMHcCcN,D2RVRsfbw0IF",",LrZ3B4SvFEfG3FqO01n","""vY4FmzhbyR4iDgYpr6f","sw83uJkitIc8trzaYmEO"

nTB"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I can then hook this up to my test method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;func TestIdentity2(t *testing.T) {
 c := quick.Config{MaxCount: 10000,
  Values: func(values []reflect.Value, r *rand.Rand) {
   values[0] = reflect.ValueOf(randCSV(r))
  }}
 if err := quick.Check(doesIdentityHold, &amp;amp;c); err != nil {
  t.Error(err)
 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now I can test &lt;code&gt;csvquote&lt;/code&gt; against ten thousand random CSV files in under a second.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; go test
PASS
ok github.com/adamgordonbell/csvquote/cmd/cvsquote 0.635s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave extending this to covering Unicode values and unquoted rows for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#property-testing"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Property Testing
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property-based testing is a powerful technique for testing your code. As you can see from this real-world but somewhat contrived scenario, it moves the work of testing away from specific test cases and towards validating properties that hold for all values. Here the property under test was that substituting and restoring are inverses of each other (and therefore form an identity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the most challenging part of property-based testing is seeing how I can transform a specific test-case into a testable property. It’s not always immediately clear what’s possible to test in this manner and some tests are simply hard to state in this form. But when a problem is well suited for property-based testing, it is a powerful tool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;( The second most challenging thing about property-based testing is writing generators for your problem domain. Although once written, they make testing in this style feel quite natural. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more-resources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More Resources
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of this style of testing is seeing where and how it can apply. The places I’ve found it valuable include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verifying serialization and deserialization code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verifying an optimization (by comparing the results to the un-optimized version)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anywhere I have more than one representation of some data and need to test the boundaries of those representations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But others have found more ways to use this paradigm. If you want to learn more about property-based testing, then &lt;a href="https://github.com/leanovate/gopter"&gt;&lt;code&gt;gopter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the GOlang Property TestER&lt;/em&gt;, is worth taking a look at. &lt;a href="https://github.com/amir"&gt;Amir Saeid&lt;/a&gt;, who’s good at this technique, recommends this &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/property-based-testing-in-a-screencast-editor"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; full of examples, and &lt;a href="https://jacobstanley.io/how-to-use-hedgehog-to-test-a-real-world-large-scale-stateful-app/"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any tips or suggested resources for property-based testing, please let me know on Twitter (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamgordonbell/"&gt;@adamgordonbell&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you care about reliable software, take a look at &lt;a href="https://earthly.dev/"&gt;Earthly&lt;/a&gt;. Earthly makes continuous integration less flakey and works with your existing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Core Concepts of React</title>
      <author>TanvirFahimBD</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 15:52:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/tanvirfahimbd/core-concepts-of-react-33ng</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/tanvirfahimbd/core-concepts-of-react-33ng</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JSX&lt;/strong&gt;: In React JSX is the syntactic sugar of javascript. Where it looks like HTML syntax but actually it’s not the HTML. Under the hood, it used babel to convert HTML syntax into javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MYkVjgR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/03crarz1ytvp1w4mx0zi.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MYkVjgR5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/03crarz1ytvp1w4mx0zi.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State&lt;/strong&gt;: In react, the state is used to keep the component updated after any changes are applied and update it. The state is managed by the component when anything changes on the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhESIQfK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nk5rgwnbf0nix3xc48mo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhESIQfK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nk5rgwnbf0nix3xc48mo.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="543"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here setCount updates the count and it is maintained by useState hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Props&lt;/strong&gt;: Props are the value of the component which is not maintained by the component itself rather it shows in the component or is passed to another component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhESIQfK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nk5rgwnbf0nix3xc48mo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhESIQfK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nk5rgwnbf0nix3xc48mo.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="543"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the count is the props that are used in the component using JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hooks&lt;/strong&gt;: Hooks are the function that is used in react to maintain or make it easier to update the state or give different functionality to make an entire application easily with it. It is used in the functional components. useState, useEffect, useParams, useRef, useLocation, useHistory, useRouteMatch, useContext are some of the commonly used hooks. There are also custom hooks available that take hooks use case to the next level like logic and view shareable like props in custom hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useState: useState update the state value if any change is applied. The updated state is then used for the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhESIQfK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nk5rgwnbf0nix3xc48mo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LhESIQfK--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nk5rgwnbf0nix3xc48mo.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="543"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useEffect&lt;/strong&gt;: If any types of side effects are applied frequently in this case useEffect is applied. Appling dependency on useEffect hook we can frequently update the specific state rather than updating the whole state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JLfr9xK6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxgt7uiz33xgovrboup8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JLfr9xK6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pxgt7uiz33xgovrboup8.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="305"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useContext&lt;/strong&gt;: useContext is used to make props passing highly easier. When props drilling become much complex the useContext makes props pass simple and organized way from the root. Where any component can use any exported props easily throw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zHRl4XIe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9n7lu27a1wfhfen6ef2z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zHRl4XIe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9n7lu27a1wfhfen6ef2z.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="262"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useParams&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on route dynamic id matching it matches and goes to the route and shows the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vO9bNYpU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yku6bebbxf3akkln78v8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vO9bNYpU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yku6bebbxf3akkln78v8.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useLocation&lt;/strong&gt;: To work with query string parameters useLocation is generally used. It mainly gets pathname or state&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---UDndXqn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6mzim6u4eenk4f6ni4y6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---UDndXqn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6mzim6u4eenk4f6ni4y6.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="410"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useHistory&lt;/strong&gt;: It is used to navigate the location from and pass to the new location using push. Other tasks are also applied depending on history action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N-L9b243--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/df45dnljlu8y2ibtygj5.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--N-L9b243--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/df45dnljlu8y2ibtygj5.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="305"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useRouteMatch&lt;/strong&gt;: If any match the object find then access is provided by useRouteMatch. Depending on route match it provides the component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;useRef&lt;/strong&gt;: It returns an object. Depending on the current value it updates the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3-YYopTq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nxx7bsi71q1aimqpnodb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3-YYopTq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nxx7bsi71q1aimqpnodb.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="323"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install ACLI V2,I will put the code&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm -rf /bin/aws
rm -rf /bin/aws*
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
ln -s /usr/local/bin/aws /bin/aws

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---XUvv2GO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmtwqlreo80fsp6fm4fj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---XUvv2GO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmtwqlreo80fsp6fm4fj.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="119"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[root@ip-172-31-43-69 ~]# yum install docker &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl start docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sAyyJFZX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xwkknrdgze3hn1vo5yo1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sAyyJFZX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xwkknrdgze3hn1vo5yo1.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="277"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3"&gt;Use ECR create repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JQnt-mBr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4o1id8d4n5ynxcg7ibc1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JQnt-mBr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4o1id8d4n5ynxcg7ibc1.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="242"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="4"&gt;Attach IAM Role To EC2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry-permissions-create.html"&gt;https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry-permissions-create.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvBBGCUP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3weecswiqbo0z2b790z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PvBBGCUP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l3weecswiqbo0z2b790z.png" alt="Image description" width="880" height="292"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="5"&gt;Build and Push Image to Repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1.Write Dockerfile&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM centos:7

RUN yum install -y openssh-server sudo
RUN sed -i 's/UsePAM yes/UsePAM no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
RUN useradd admin  
RUN echo "admin:123456" | chpasswd
RUN echo "admin   ALL=(ALL)       ALL" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/sudoers 

RUN ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
RUN ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
EXPOSE 22
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;2.Build Image&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;[root@ip-172-31-43-69 ~]# docker build -t sshd .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KAPNV4Nz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p452clp1etpj627x0q83.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KAPNV4Nz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p452clp1etpj627x0q83.png" alt="Image description" width="644" height="125"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3.Tag and Push Image&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
docker tag sshd:latest aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/sshd:latest
docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/sshd:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan Scheffler: Hello and welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaunchiesShow"&gt;Launchies&lt;/a&gt;, proudly brought to you by New Relic's Developer Relations team, &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;The Relicans&lt;/a&gt;. The Launchies podcast is about supporting new developers and telling their stories and helping you make the next step in what we certainly hope is a very long and healthy career in software. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="//developer.newrelic.com/podcasts"&gt;developer.newrelic.com/podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. We're so glad you're here. Enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren Lee: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kiran_oliver"&gt;Rin&lt;/a&gt; is a Technical Community builder at &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt;. They enjoy discussing all things open-source with a particular focus on improving hiring pipelines in the technology industry for those that are neurodivergent and improving the developer experience for new and returning open-source software contributors. Rin, welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/launchies"&gt;Launchies&lt;/a&gt;. I'm so excited to be chatting with you today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran Oliver: I'm super excited to be chatting with you, too. Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: 100%. &lt;a href="https://dev.to/newrelic/an-epic-excellent-eclectic-episode-with-kiran-oliver-ibe"&gt;And we also should shout out that you have been on a New Relic Podcast before. So we should just immediately after folks listen to this one, go check out the Polyglot version or episode of this conversation as well.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: That would be awesome. Yes, please do. Definitely go check out that. That was a fun conversation. I got to talk about candle-making and all those other things that I do outside of tech. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Very cool. That is incredible. So here at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/launchies"&gt;Launchies&lt;/a&gt;, though, we should clarify this is all about your journey into tech and how did you break into it? What were you doing beforehand if you were ever in other industries? Et cetera. And just celebrating that for folks that also might be curious to take the plunge themselves. So, would you mind taking me back in time? Have you always been in tech? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: No, absolutely not. No way. Not even close. Not even remotely close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I actually didn't get started in tech until 2015. I actually didn't get my bachelor's degree until I was 30. I am 36 now. So I was a non-traditional learner. And I also have a non-traditional path into tech in that I actually have a public relations degree in communications. And my background was actually in journalism. And where I got started in tech was actually as a technology journalist at &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt;. So that's when I got started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: So technology journalist. That's interesting. So you were writing and researching, meeting folks about tech companies and the movement and things that were happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Let's go back even further. What drew you to journalism itself? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I've always been a writer. I've always loved to tell stories. And I've always loved to really put those together and really tell a meaningful, impactful story that meant a lot to people and that taught them something or showed them an experience that they might not have necessarily had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always just been a writer. I've been writing since I was old enough to know how to write in general. I started with fanfiction. Shout out to all you fellow fanfic writers. Appreciate you. And I'm not ashamed of that. Fanfic is a great avenue for people to get into writing. And I really think that it's useful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: It was my favorite unit when I was an English teacher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: It is? Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: To have students, you know, okay, we finished this story. We finished &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello"&gt;Othello&lt;/a&gt;, now fanfic. What is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iago"&gt;Iago&lt;/a&gt;? What is he pining for? What is he loving? And just demonstrate that you know these characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Know the characters, exactly. And it gives them a way to demonstrate that they know the content while putting it in a context that they can understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Right. And bring them to modern-day. How are they functioning at this high school? What does that look like for them? Yeah, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Give it your College AU spin, yeah. What's that look like? Exactly. Are they roommates? Are they friends to lovers? Are they just...yeah, the whole thing. Mm-hmm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I love it. Okay, so that was your entry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Actually, before that, it's really important to know that before &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt;, I actually feel it's really important to know that I worked at &lt;a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Until tech, I was actually really broke. I was one of the people that got SNAP benefits. And I was on food stamps. I was very broke and very poor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was freelancing, and I caught the eye of Alex at &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt;. And it was a really lucky break for me because, until that point, I was working two jobs and going to school. I was working from 4:00 o'clock in the morning until 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon at Starbucks opening. And then I would drive to Best Buy and work from 2:00 o'clock in the morning till 11:00 o'clock at night, come home and do my homework, and start it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Wow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: And I got I think I want to say $280 something a week for that. And it was pretty rough. So yeah, SNAP benefits kept me afloat. And I think it's very important to acknowledge that getting the break into tech changed my life in a fundamental way. And I truly hope that this podcast can encourage others that they can do that too, especially if they come from a journalism background. You can use your writing ability to change your life in a way that you could never even imagine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I love that. Thank you for saying that. I think that is wildly inspiring too. I'm curious then, so breaking into That New Stack. Am I saying that...New Stack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt;. Yep, that's them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: There is the, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yes, it's &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, there is a the.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I was like, I'm missing something. [laughter] The Facebook Meta has now been changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Oh boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I know. Anyway, I should not have said that. [laughter] So that was your big break, as you're calling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: It was, yes. Yes, yes. Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Tell me about those first couple...how long were you there for? Tell me about that experience and what you learned there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I was at &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt; for four and a half years and change-ish thereabouts. I started just as a journalist. But over time, I actually evolved my role. And I ended up being a full-time employee, and I ended up producing podcasts. So that was really cool. And I learned a lot there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to go to a lot of &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCons&lt;/a&gt;, and going to &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon&lt;/a&gt; actually got me involved in &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;. And I was able to actually become a member of &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, which was the thing that got me into DevRel. Meeting people in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience"&gt;Contributor Experience SIG&lt;/a&gt; and getting involved in that community, and contributing back to Upstream &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; got me really involved in open source and got me involved in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I love that. I think for me, I can totally relate to that. I attended &lt;a href="https://rubyconf.org/"&gt;RubyConf&lt;/a&gt; when I was still at my bootcamp. And that was my first introduction to DevRel as well. It was this community piece that I was craving. I just wanted to be a part of something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it just introduced me to this wonderfully inclusive space where people said, "Yeah, tell your story, or tell people how you're building what you've built. And there's a whole role here or industry for you for folks that want to be educators or teachers or build community, and celebrate those sorts of things for other people and other developers." So I absolutely relate to that just, you know, the moment you step in. I always call it &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon&lt;/a&gt;. Am I incorrect in that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: It's actually &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon + CloudNativeCon&lt;/a&gt; is the official name for it. It's both of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Oh my gosh, thank you. I had no idea. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: That's okay. Now you do. That's awesome. Yeah, &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon + CloudNativeCon&lt;/a&gt; is the official name of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Love it. I have tried as a New Year's resolution last year to stop apologizing for when I don't know things, just to clarify, to ask a question, to normalize that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Totally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Because there's something about that like, oh, I'm sorry. I don't get that. Can you clarify? I don't know what we're talking about. But instead, to model that for the folks that might be newer into the industry on my team that, you know, I don't what this means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I agree completely because what we think is commonplace some people don't. And that's very important to highlight what you think is common knowledge might not be for everybody else. I think that's a very good thing to highlight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: For sure. Okay. So when did you make that jump to &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt; and tell me about what you do there? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Okay, so I made the jump to &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt; in January of this year. So I've been there coming up on a year in January 2022, so yeah, super excited. I actually ended up in the &lt;a href="https://devrelcollective.slack.com/"&gt;DevRel Collective Slack&lt;/a&gt; from a previous role I was at. I worked briefly at a startup called Esper. I was a Platform Evangelist there. And that got me into the &lt;a href="https://devrelcollective.slack.com/"&gt;DevRel Collective Slack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I saw the job opportunity for the Technical Community Builder come in, and I was like, I want that job. That job sounds great. And I went through the interview process. I met everybody. I met &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mary_grace"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt;. I met my manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MissAmaraKay"&gt;Amara&lt;/a&gt;, and we hit it off really well. And it was just a really awesome interview process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they actually made an effort to really research what it's like to work with someone that's neurodivergent from a manager's standpoint, and that really stuck out to me. So that was really awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yeah, that was great. And I like what I do here. And it's also great that the role keeps evolving. And the role is continuing to evolve as time goes on. And I find myself doing things that I never imagined I would be doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on DevSecOps last week or the week before at KubeCon at their DevX Days, which is all about the developer experience because, in my role at &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt;, I'm on the developer experience team. And I never imagined that I'd be doing that. That was really wonderful to see. And &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt; encouraged me to do that and gave me the skills that I needed to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I think that that speaks so highly of a community culture where they want to push you career-wise and to never allow you to plateau and provide those opportunities to grow and to learn new things constantly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Absolutely. I have never in my time at &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt; heard no. We want to support you in doing the things that you find interesting, and we will never take opportunities away from you if you find them enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Wow, that's so cool. So what are some sort of things that you're learning right now or you're excited to take on next? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Right now, I'm looking at Community Health Metrics a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I'm really digging into things like &lt;a href="https://cauldron.io/"&gt;cauldron.io&lt;/a&gt;, which is a project undertaken by &lt;a href="https://bitergia.com/"&gt;Bitergia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chaoss.community/"&gt;The CHAOSS Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. So I'm really digging deep into community metrics working with &lt;a href="https://orbit.love/"&gt;Orbit&lt;/a&gt; as well. We're hoping to work together on some &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the stuff I'm also working on is just &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; CI/CD, a lot of stuff around DevSecOps and security-based open-source community functions, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Heck yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: That's what I'm handling. And I also work on...my big project at &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Camunda Community Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; organization where all of our community-built extensions live so that way people know that these are community projects. They can contribute to them. But they're not necessarily officially supported by &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt;. But you can still come there and collaborate and extend out your &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt; software using these extensions and perhaps improve your experience or the experience of your customers by using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Hmm, that's really cool. It sounds really interesting. I'm a big fan of everything that your team is doing. I think you're really pushing the needle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Oh, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Yeah, for sure. I'm curious, so looking back on your life, if I were to ask you what do you think kept you from entering tech before you did, is it because you had a love that was greater than tech at first? It was the journalism piece, or perhaps was it something else? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: What kept me from tech? Well, to be brutally honest, for a bit of time, wasn't in the best of places relationship-wise for a good chunk of my teen years. So in high school and early college, I wasn't so much able to get the experience that I should have in university. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And accessibility for someone that was neurodivergent for university in the '90s and in the early 2000s was lacking. And at that point, I wasn't in that great a place. It wasn't until I got married and met my wife that I was in a more stable relationship place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was pretty challenging for me to get into that because I didn't really see a future per se coming from a background that had experienced things like domestic violence and all of those wonderful things. So coming from that background, it was hard to see a future at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I finally met my wife and we got married and all of those wonderful things, it was a lot easier to see a future. And it was my wife that encouraged me to actually get back into tech and get my degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I'm really grateful for her pushing me to do that because it really, truly changed our lives in a lot of ways. And it was nice to see that light at the end of the tunnel and to see that I could come out the other side from what had been really harmful and abusive relationships in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Oh my gosh. Well, thank you for sharing that. And what a wonderful shout out to your wife also. That is incredible to be encouraged to pursue your dreams, your goals and to redefine what success might look like. And that's a really scary thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: It is, yeah. My family was also really supportive. They never said, "No, you can't do that." They never really said, "You can't do these things because you're neurodivergent." They said, "Do whatever you need to do. We support your dreams." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But education was rough. I was the first person in my immediate family to get a degree. My aunt had a Bachelor's Degree in Education, but she passed away when I was 12. So I wasn't able to really talk to her about higher education because I didn't get that opportunity. My grandparents didn't go to university, as far as I'm aware. And my mother and my father both didn't go to university. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father is a senior captain at a steamship, which required a lot of testing, but it was not a traditional degree. He didn't even graduate high school. And my mother didn't go to college, but she did graduate high school, and she was in banking for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So college wasn't something that was presented to us. And my brother attended trade school, so it was a totally different ballgame. We came from a very different background that was not necessarily...And in the time that I grew up, everyone in my demographic did it. And that's how we learned to develop. Our first thing was an HTML website, and we all coded on Neopets or whatever we did. And that's totally valid; HTML and Neopets are coding. And if anybody ever tells you it's not, it is. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Yeah, they come talk to me if they're fighting that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yeah, exactly, exactly. We can throw down. [laughs] And the STEM programs that were there in the past aren't anywhere near like they are today. The opportunity wasn't there. And the opportunity especially wasn't there if you were someone who presented as female. I am transmasculine and non-binary. But I didn't start transitioning until I was well past school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the opportunity wasn't there from a gender identity standpoint, at least for me because they offered those opportunities to people they presumed to be cisgender males. So that was something that wasn't offered to you. We didn't get that option. You got home ec, and you got cooking class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Yep. And I still know how to make that apple pie I learned in home ec. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I sure do. Ask me about that tofu strawberry smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Oh my God, a tofu strawberry smoothie sounds...okay. I mean, I could see that being good. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: It was actually. Silken tofu is a great source of protein to put in smoothies. I will never knock it. It's actually great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: [laughs] I completely relate to that. I had no clue that this was...anytime someone asked me that question I'm like, why didn't...? No, I had no concept that that was --&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly. It was never offered. How will you know? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I'm not technically adjacent either in my life. I didn't know other people that were developers. And it wasn't in my orbit at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: No one I knew was a developer. My parents, their friends were all on that ship. They were working on the boat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I guess that also made for a pretty rude awakening, though, when I did enter this industry, the toxic masculinity. There are just a lot of tropes that I think people may know or have in their stereotypes from movies and things. I wasn't even aware of those things. And so it just hit me like a ton of bricks on those first couple days when I was a newbie at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Oh wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: But I leveled up pretty quickly. [chuckles] And I had a wonderful network of folks. I was lucky. I went to a coding bootcamp for women, and gender diverse folk in Seattle called &lt;a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/"&gt;Ada Developers Academy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Ooh. I've heard of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: And so I had a really beautiful bubble of learning to code where for a year we were just really collaborative, not competitive with each other. It was really, really special. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I love it. That's awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: So thinking about your prior life, it’s in the world of journalism. Do you see yourself using those skills that you learned at &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt; today as a technical community builder? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Absolutely. I can't stress how much I use the skills I learned as a journalist and the skills I learned as a podcast producer because you have to know how to talk to people, and not only that, but you have to learn how to herd cats, a lot of cats. And especially when you're scheduling interviews, and you're talking to people, it helps you, for example, if you're at a booth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did my first booth last weekend at &lt;a href="https://2021.allthingsopen.org/"&gt;All Things Open&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mary_grace"&gt;Mary&lt;/a&gt; had said to me, "You did phenomenally. I can't believe this is your first booth. It doesn't seem like it at all." And I'm like; I learned that from retail. And I learned it from &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt; because you've got to be on your game. And you got to be personable and sociable and go out there and really be friendly with people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you learn that from being a journalist because you have to ask questions that people want to answer. You have to be approachable. You have to be friendly. And you have to talk to people in a way that makes them feel like they know you. And they do because everyone I saw I actually basically knew. [laughs] &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://2021.allthingsopen.org/"&gt;All Things Open&lt;/a&gt; were basically like a giant friend group, and it was great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: [laughs] It's your community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yeah, I saw a lot of new people, though. That was wonderful. That was even better. I was meeting new people that I didn't know before, or I had just known them through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. And it was like, oh wow, now I can finally meet you in person. And it was great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I did love that &lt;a href="https://2021.allthingsopen.org/"&gt;All Things Open&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon&lt;/a&gt; were also virtual because I really...the push to put things back to in-person. I'm not a fan of that. I'd like to keep things hybrid because I think that's very important because it's an accessibility thing where some people can't go to events. They don't have the money. They don't have the ability to travel. And it's like these things are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Virtual gives a lot more people the opportunity to be at these events. And I think that's very important to keep things hybrid in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I really genuinely could not agree more. I'm so happy that some things are and events are opening back up, and they're in person. I just was at &lt;a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/"&gt;Strange Loop&lt;/a&gt;. We have &lt;a href="https://cascadiarconf.com/"&gt;Cascadia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; coming up, and I'm thrilled to be able to attend them. But absolutely, the hybrid approach, and to make sure that you're live streaming every single talk and to make sure that there are avenues for people to engage in a dialogue, benefits everyone, both in-person and remote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I've been very excited about the trend that we're making in the industry for events. But I will say it was really wonderful to be back in person with folks and just, I don't know, meet people that you're excited to meet and build that community and make new friends. And I will speak for myself, not everyone, but I missed it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, back to the piece on the retail piece. I could not agree more. I've done a bunch of booths in DevRel before the pandemic and whatnot. But we had someone on the booth, a co-worker, who it was his first time. He worked for years at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, was a manager, had worked the floor, killed it on the booth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: And it's because he worked in retail because that's what you have to do. And it's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Shocked that it was his first time. So yeah, completely same story in a way of like, you just engaged in a really authentic way with folks, not just like, hi, what's your name? Can I tell you about &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt;? That feels super inauthentic and just kind of, I don't know, blah, boring. But no, like, hey, what's going on? What are you working on right now? Like, just the great...I don't know; I was very impressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, again, I love these moments when our prior lives inform our world today. And we can see these things or these unique journeys to tech as assets in the industry as opposed to something that we need to...detriments or things that we need to not ever speak about again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Absolutely. Every time I see "Your application must require a CS degree," I'm like, that's fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: [laughs] I'm like, oh, you're super antiquated in the way that you define success. Bye. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly. I'm like, okay, that's nice. Good to know. Good to know. Not working there ever. [laughs] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Yeah, exactly. And I love the whisper networks that exist. &lt;a href="https://devrelcollective.fun/"&gt;DevRel Collective&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of one we can shout out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I love &lt;a href="https://devrelcollective.fun/"&gt;DevRel Collective&lt;/a&gt;. It's fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Yeah. And places just to say, hey, this is a really wonderful place to work. It is an incredible culture. Here's an opening. Let's chat. I think it's important for us to share those with our communities and folks that are entering tech so that we can make sure that their first role is a positive one. Because I think that that's the make it or break it time for folks to really make sure that they're having a positive onboarding experience into tech itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I agree completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: So let's see. Can you share any life lessons that you've learned since your transition to tech? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Life lessons, I would say that even when it seems like everything is going wrong, you can always come back. In 2019 actually, &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/"&gt;The New Stack&lt;/a&gt; encouraged me to get into DevRel and to get into community. And what that actually looked like was a mutual parting of the ways which led me where I am today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the time, I was devastated. But now I see that for what it was; it was an opportunity to get to where I am. Because they said, "You are so good at DevRel. You are so good at communications, and we want to give you the opportunity to succeed. And for that, we're going to let you go, and we're going to let you grow and see what you can do." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was amazing for me because I actually got to go to &lt;a href="https://thenewstack.io/join-us-for-the-new-stacks-first-virtual-pancake-breakfast-and-qa-with-datastax/"&gt;The New Stack Pancake Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;. And that was a couple of weeks ago at &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon + CloudNativeCon&lt;/a&gt;. And I got to say hi to Alex and Judy and sit in the audience instead of someone that was the producer. And I got to ask a question to the panelists that actually was relevant to the conversation because I had learned the skills to ask a question that mattered. And that was wonderful. It was really cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they were so good to me. They are still good to me to this day. And it was really, really nice to come full circle and say, "You know, it's so good to see you all again. And I want to thank you for what you did for me because it honestly changed my life." And it was really awesome to see them as a speaker at a &lt;a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/"&gt;KubeCon&lt;/a&gt; and a speaker at DevX Day and to say, "I did this, and I wouldn't have been able to if you hadn't seen that spark in me. And I really appreciate it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I spent a lot of telling people, "I really appreciate you." And I think that's something that we all need to do is sit there and look back and thank people for the impact they've had on our lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: It's really beautiful. I couldn't agree more. We can shout it from the mountaintops when we adore people that have gotten us somewhere, an advocate or a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Take the time to say thanks and to let them know how important they are in your life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I think I've thanked probably 75 people, if not more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Aw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: And it's so awesome to see. When I first started getting involved in &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, it was writing a blog post in 2018 for the first Diversity Lunch and Hack event they ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: And Paris Pittman reached out to me and said, "You should join &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience"&gt;The Contributor Experience SIG&lt;/a&gt;." And Paris is one of those people that I thanked extensively. And I said, "Thank you for everything. Thank you so much." Because getting me involved in &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; has introduced me to so many wonderful people. And without people like Paris and everyone that I know in the Kubernetes community, I absolutely would not be the person I am today. There's no way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: It's really cool to be able to look back on those moments too and to see the thread and say, "That was the light bulb moment. That was when my life changed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: And it sounds almost hyperbolic but attending &lt;a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/"&gt;Ada Developers Academy&lt;/a&gt; changed my life. It was wildly...it shifted everything. And attending those conferences or meeting those people and just to really pause. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yeah, absolutely. And for me, getting to do things like work on introducing security into our automated release tool at Camunda in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Community Hub&lt;/a&gt; absolutely has changed the trajectory of my life because people now listen to me give talks on things like DevSecOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I've made some new connections that I never thought I could make, and that's awesome. And I am very grateful for Amara's support and for Mary's support, and for the support of our infrastructure team and just basically everyone involved in making that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I mean, look out, world. You're on the up and up. I'm excited for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I also work with wonderful people. I've been working for the last few quarters with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidgsIoT"&gt;David Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, who's a wonderful developer relations professional here at &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt;. And we worked on a project together for sentiment analysis, and then that goes back into that community health. And that's been really wonderful to watch too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: That's so important. You have a stacked team there for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: We sure do. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I love it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: We're hiring. Join us.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[laughter]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: We'll put a link to the careers page in the show notes for sure. Do you have any advice for those that are wanting to make the leap into tech that you can share? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Advice? Gosh. I would say that, like I said, even if it seems like you're never going to recover, you can keep going. Even if this is your worst day, tomorrow will be better. And while it may seem like your worst day, it's only one day. Things will get better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And always, I would just say reach out, connect with people, learn everything that you can. I would say get involved in open source. I would absolutely say contribute to open source and write docs. Documentation is huge, and everybody needs good documentation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would say submit to CFPs. And if you need help submitting to CFPs, there are absolutely tons of projects out there that will help you. I will personally help you. If you say, "Rin, I need help with CFP," please send me a tweet. I will help you any day of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think that it's really important to just realize that you know more than you think you do. You're your own worst critic. And everyone always has that voice that says, "You can't do that." And it's very important to recognize that voice and say, "Actually, I can. Watch me." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I mean, I think that the hard part about breaking into this particular industry and learning to code itself is that a lot of folks are used to being an expert in their industry or their fields and to being successful. They've gotten promotions, or they've mastered the art in whatever industry they're in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, you're failing every single day when you're learning to code. And the fact that people normalize that, and they're constantly confused, and they're Googling things. And I have a mentee right now that she asked me yesterday, like, "Is it okay that I'm Googling so much?" It's like, "Absolutely. That's a skill in itself. You're learning the art of &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: But I think the switch to the peaks and the valleys of having to bang your head against a wall of errors in your code all the time and then just nail it. But then you quickly move on to something you don't know, and you have a new problem ahead of you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it's easy to forget about the things that you've learned and just be like, oh, I'm always confused, or I always have a new thing that I'm trying to learn and make sense of. It can be a pretty tricky thing to navigate, I think. So to suddenly hear that, you know, I'm the senior engineer, and I still get confused all the time. [laughs] Come join me on Twitch. I never know what I'm doing. But that's maybe normalized or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, I've gotten comfortable in that space that it's okay not to have memorized the syntax of it all and to be excited by that, in fact. And you get to be forever a learner. It is a cool thing. But I think that that I've noticed is just a bit terrifying for folks when making that beginning jump into tech itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yeah. And I also think it's important to call out that code doesn't necessarily mean non-technical. And I want to strike the word non-technical from everyone's vocabulary. And I also think that things like documentation are super important and things like using the tools that make things easier, &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;, writing &lt;a href="https://yaml.org/"&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt;. All these things are valid, and they're important. And writing Markdown is still coding. Computer…docs is still coding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be C++. It doesn't have to be Python. It doesn't have to be JavaScript and especially if you have dyscalculia like I do. I can only get so far in JavaScript before there's no more JavaScript I can learn because I'm not great at algebra. And recognizing that is okay. But I'm not going to sit here and willingly make myself feel bad because I don't know algebra. I can contribute in other ways. I can write docs; I can use &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;; I, I can use no-code or low-code tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now there are things like &lt;a href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://copilot.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt; is a whole thing in and of itself, which you got to weigh your pros and cons with some of these tools. But a lot of them out there are really there to make your life easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use templates. Use things that make your life easier. And make sure that you're not necessarily making yourself feel bad for something that you have no control over. And if somebody tries to gatekeep you by saying you're not a real programmer, you can be like, "Mm, okay, can I understand your docs? If I can't, then that's a problem for you." [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I've worked at companies before that celebrate that ethos of it's hard to learn this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly. But it shouldn't be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: And I'm like, oh, wow. Y'all are toxic. I got to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly. Yeah, bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: That isn't cool. Let's be welcoming to folks who are trying to learn this and encourage them. Give them a path to entry that makes them successful, how noble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Exactly. You got to streamline contributor experience. You've got to make sure that the contributor experience ladder allows for people from all backgrounds to contribute, whether they come from a CS background or a non-CS background. You've got to have those opportunities available for everyone and make sure that everybody that's contributing whether it's docs or code, still feels like they're appreciated and that nobody is held on a pedestal compared to anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I couldn't agree more. Retweet. Okay, Rin, make your shout out. What would you like listeners to go check out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: I would love you to check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Camunda Community Hub&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Please do go check that out. That is our wonderful, like I said, &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; organization where our open-source community extensions reside. You can find some open-source projects to contribute to. We'd love it if you did. Feel free to give that a look and see what's over there. We have a lot of wonderful stuff happening in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Community Hub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd also love it if you checked out...it's at &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/career/"&gt;camunda.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;. We're hiring. Please join us. Wonderful stuff. Just check out &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;camunda.com&lt;/a&gt; in general. Feel free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: We'll include all of those links in the show notes. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Definitely check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Camunda Community Hub&lt;/a&gt; for sure. If you were to check out one thing, check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Community Hub&lt;/a&gt;. It's really great. And also if you're interested in our meetups, please check out our meetup page. We have a lot of those. So feel free to check those out as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do have our &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/developers/champions/"&gt;Champion Program&lt;/a&gt; if you are already using &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/"&gt;Camunda&lt;/a&gt;. We will be opening a new cohort next year. Feel free to get involved. Get on our &lt;a href="https://forum.camunda.org/"&gt;Camunda forums&lt;/a&gt; and contribute to our community, and you might be a &lt;a href="https://camunda.com/developers/champions/"&gt;Camunda Champion&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I love it. That's so great. Rin, where can people find you online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Oh geez. They can find me on Twitter. And I'm sorry in advance because I tweet a lot. Feel free to mute me. [laughter] My Twitter is the little @ thing, and then it's K-I-R-A-N_O-L-I-V-E-R. That's me &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kiran_oliver"&gt;@kiran_oliver&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ckoliver/"&gt;I am on LinkedIn at CK Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, or you can just search my name Kiran Oliver, and I'll come up. I've got purple hair. And on &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, I'm C as in cat E-L-A-N–T-H-E, &lt;a href="https://github.com/celanthe"&gt;Celanthe&lt;/a&gt;. And that'll be me. And you'll probably see me in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/camunda-community-hub"&gt;Community Hub&lt;/a&gt; if you click around. I am there. Yeah, so that's me on the internet. I also have a website &lt;a href="https://ckoliver.com/"&gt;ckoliver.com&lt;/a&gt;, but it has not been updated in a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I mean, yeah, those personal websites are so hard to maintain. I'm feeling the pressure from what is the…&lt;a href="https://www.polywork.com/"&gt;Polywork&lt;/a&gt;. Are you on that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Oh gosh, yeah. &lt;a href="https://www.polywork.com/"&gt;Polywork&lt;/a&gt; I might poke at while I'm off but in the Christmas-y lull. Might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I'm going to add that to my to-do list for that also. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Yeah, I know, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: Let's be each other's accountability buddy, and we'll do it. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: For sure, yeah. Are we Twitter mutuals? I'll bug you. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: I mean, I'm sure we are. Oh, you know what? No, that's on me. Yes, we are now. Okay. I am so grateful for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Thank you. This was awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: This was so wonderful to chat with you and hear your story. Such a joy. Everyone go give Rin 1,000 thank yous for sharing advice, wisdom, personal experiences, and just tips on navigating this wild space that is tech. And yeah, I just so, so appreciate you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiran: Thank you so much for the opportunity. This has been wonderful. I really appreciate it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren: All right. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of the rest of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;therelicans.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Jonan Scheffler: Hello and welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/polyglot"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt;, proudly brought to you by &lt;a href="https://newrelic.com"&gt;New Relic's&lt;/a&gt; developer relations team, &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;The Relicans&lt;/a&gt;. Polyglot is about software design. It's about looking beyond languages to the patterns and methods that we as developers use to do our best work. You can join us every week to hear from developers who have stories to share about what has worked for them and may have some opinions about how best to write quality software. We may not always agree, but we are certainly going to have fun, and we will always do our best to level up together. You can find the show notes for this episode and all of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="//developer.newrelic.com/podcasts"&gt;developer.newrelic.com/podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you so much for joining us. Enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Greenberg: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane"&gt;Lorna Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; is based in Yorkshire, United Kingdom. She is Head of DevRel at &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; as well as a published author and experienced conference speaker. She has a strong background in open source and a passion for better developer experiences for developers everywhere. You can find out more about Lorna on her website at &lt;a href="https://lornajane.net/"&gt;lornajane.net&lt;/a&gt;. Lorna, welcome to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyglotShow"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna Mitchell: Hi, thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: It is so nice to have you. I was recently on a plane on my way back home because that is the story of so much of developer relations, on a plane somewhere. And I was reading a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/5-ways-to-improve-mental-health-for-software-developers/"&gt;recent article you wrote in TechCrunch around improving mental health for developers&lt;/a&gt;. And I absolutely loved that article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so much of what you wrote in that article really resonated with me, specifically around when you talked about burnout, and what causes burnout, and how we can help mitigate against burnout. And I wonder if you could share some of those insights with us here on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyglotShow"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah, let me try and summarize. It's definitely a topic that's really close to my heart, which is why you see me writing about it and on &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/5-ways-to-improve-mental-health-for-software-developers/"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, which is amazing. I think burnout for developers for DevRel as well is we can do amazing things. Like, humans are incredible, and they have untold depths. When you really believe in something, isn't it incredible what you can do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I feel like burnout is the opposite when you don't really believe in it, or you're really dragging yourself or being dragged through something. So it's about conflict. It's about there being too much of something that you don't want. Sometimes it's too much of something you do want, and we see that particularly in the startup founders burning out. They literally just burn everything they have to chase their dream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: For me, that burnout piece is about taking care of yourself and realizing when something is happening, or something is changing that it is time to look after yourself. And I think this is something that we should be better at as technical professionals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't wait till the disk is 99% full before you upgrade [chuckles] to new storage. You set the alert level at 80%, and you get a new disk. You deploy it to a bigger cloud or whatever your setup is. So don't wait until you're absolutely broken because the roadmap from there is long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So how do you know when your disk is getting to 99% full when we're talking about burnout? What are some of the cues that you've seen in others or maybe in yourself that says, "Wait, hold on a moment here. I think I'm approaching a crisis moment." And what are some of the signs, and what do you do to help address those?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: The signs are, for me, it's definitely negativity. I mean, it's all right to be grumpy once in a while. But if you're grumpy four days out of five, something's wrong, especially in something like software development or developer relations where really, we are doing what we love. We are chasing our dreams. And so when that's gone wrong, I think that's one really big sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm remote from my team, and I have been for more than a decade in all sorts of different types of jobs and different employers. And you have small children; you’ll know this; when it's too quiet in the other room, and you suddenly hear the silence, and you run through to find they are cutting up something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Something is wrong when it's too quiet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah, it's too quiet. It's a little bit like that that you don't get the same engagement on the virtual channels. It's harder to tell when you're not in the office. You might see someone leaving early or coming in late or just looking a bit rubbish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think for remote teams, this stuff is harder, but it makes it more important that we look out for those signs in each other, in losing interest in hobbies, being less present at work, always being negative. Like, let's talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would rather reach out to someone and then think I'm a lunatic for deciding they had a problem that didn't exist than not reach out to someone that I could have given some words of support to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So being overly proactive in your support and care for your colleagues because that proactivity might not hurt, but it'll definitely potentially help if they're actually in a crisis situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think what you said is particularly prescient around when we actually really love what we're doing, when we care about what we're doing when we're passionate about the things that we're working on, that's when the challenges of burnout can become even more pressing in many ways. That's a really, really good insight. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you also in that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/5-ways-to-improve-mental-health-for-software-developers/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, you talked around...so we work in code, we're working in software, whether we're working in core engineering teams or working in developer relations. Our lives gravitate around the cycles of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you talked about open source, what that culture of open source can come and contribute to our teams, whether our developer relations teams, our engineering teams. How does the culture of open source lend insight, and what kind of insight can it lend to our working teams?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: I think increasingly, we are remote now. And if you think about the things that have been built in open source by people who not only have you never met in person but may only know one another by an IRC handle, mailing list, my mind is slightly blown. I look at the number of meetings on my calendar for things that really are not Linux, [laughter], and I wonder why we're not better at this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the open-source practices of always logging the bug in a formal way, giving a description that somebody else can use to replicate without needing to go back to the original author. My projects, a lot of the reviewers will have merge access. I expect the reviewers to merge. Don't wait for the author again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's about asynchronous work and trust, giving all the information but also the permission and passing it forward so that everyone can do their best work in turn. And this is important across time zones. It's important across open-source projects where people are not available on a regular schedule. It's maybe your Sunday night. I ran an open-source project for years on purely the occasional Sunday night blitz. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: And you can do a lot. And I think our developer relations is a bit like that because the interruptions of conference season mean that we are, as I described to my office-based colleagues, very unreliable. Because you'll find the wrong month of the year the whole team is gone for three weeks. Don't talk to us. We are fundamentally not here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: And so being able to set those tasks up and to be able to jump in and make a difference with them at the right time is really important. And I think that's what comes from an open-source culture, which is very respectful of everyone's time because they volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: If you take a step back, what you said is absolutely astounding. You look at what has been created over time to this very day and continues in that culture of open source without anyone maybe even knowing each other's full names, not living in the same geographic proximity, not having back-to-back &lt;a href="https://zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; meetings together. And yet, entire worlds of open source that we all rely upon have been created in this culture of, like you said, accountable, empowered, open-source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it sounds like to me one of the things that people can do is be very intentional in their asynchronous communication, describing things in a way in which that person who's describing it would not need to be reached out to again for clarification unless absolutely necessary. But because they've described it so well, that the work can continue, and trusting and empowering built on that foundation of intentional descriptiveness, intentional accountability. I think that's absolutely profound. You're totally right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: How I try to work with my team is I how try to build things with other people. And again, they might not be full-time. I mean, it is my team now, but this is my first time really officially being in charge. And so the rest of the time, I've just brought people along with me and tried to get people to buy in as a side project or whatever. And you have to respect people's time. And it lets us do our best work, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So what ways are you doing then now at fostering and cultivating that culture now that you are the person in charge? The buck stops with you, Lorna. So in what ways are you doing that in your team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Well, it's brilliant. I just tell people what to do, and they do it. [laughter] It's like playing the game on easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: You just get to do it, and that's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: [laughs] Yeah, I just assign things to them, and they do it as opposed to having to gain excitement around the project, and tag issues, and ask people nicely or whatever, and that still happens. The big project that I'm working on at work is our new docs portal, and the whole company has input into that. It's very much like an open-source project. In fact, it is an open-source project because it's a public repo as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So, our listeners, we will link to the public repo for &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href="https://developer.aiven.io/"&gt;docs portal&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/5-ways-to-improve-mental-health-for-software-developers/"&gt;article on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; in the show notes once this is published. But talking about the docs portal, it's a great transition because I was looking at that codebase just a few days ago. And you're doing some really interesting things there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know you have a lot to say about docs as somebody who has thought deeply about what docs mean for developers. And I think we have to start at ground zero, which is why are docs...why is documentation important when you're thinking about developer tooling and developer products?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: I think that docs...it's entry-level. We know from the recent surveys...the &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021"&gt;Stack Overflow survey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://octoverse.github.com/"&gt;GitHub State of the Universe&lt;/a&gt; both, I think threw this up as well that people really expect docs, and they rely on them. All of us are new to something sometime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for developer experience, there are lots of things we could do to make things easier. But writing things down is the number one way. It's not the coolest or the most glamorous or the most high-profile way to convey information. And we work in developer relations, and we're famous for all sorts of...we're both streamers and whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: When you write something down, that content can be searched. It can be discovered by machines. Someone can read it; it can be spoken out loud, it can be translated, it can be read with high contrast. It can also be read by someone on the other side of the world. It's low bandwidth. It can be read in a hurry; someone can search for the keyword on the page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be read for years from now when someone else is learning the cool technology that I'm excited about today. They don't have to find me giving the talk or find the recording. The information is there. And it's just there to support them and to help them along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have documentation, there's no point in having a product because people can't use it. You're not enabling the developer experience if there's nothing there for them to understand and get started with. I've been a writer for a long time, but I'm super passionate about documentation as such an important part of any developer-facing product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Sounds like documentation as written documentation serves as the foundation stone for everything else you build on top of it for all the reasons you enumerated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was speaking to somebody who was telling me that...and this is an angle I had never really considered, but this person is not neurotypical. And they said that written documentation for them allows them to process the content in their own time and in their own unique modalities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas if I'm presenting to them in a stream or in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; video, I get to choose how I present it, whereas, in the written content, they can consume it in the way that is best for them. And honestly, I had never considered that perspective either until that person said it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written content not only is it evergreen for good and for bad sometimes, and it's stable, and it's searchable and indexable. But it also allows the consumer of the content to consume it in any way that they need to consume it without you deciding how that should be consumed. So you start with reading content when you're beginning your documentation for anything you're working on. And it hearkens back to your open-source history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah, I think so. And I think that kind of low bandwidth, high information, the written content is also easier to have reviewed, to have additions, to have updates in a way that your conference doc or your recording isn't going to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, I like to publish video, and it's something that we're also working on at &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;. But if the content is not written down, it's like, pics, or it didn't happen. You have to be able to find that in written form with your favorite search engine in the moment that you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Something I think about also is I'm sure &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; has different audience personas, including junior developers who are just starting out and staff level of senior-level engineers who are maybe looking for an entirely different picture. How do you build documentation, or where do you start when you're building your documentation that addresses those different needs of different developers along their learning journey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: The thing about developers is they're very good at finding their way around. I'm stereotyping, but they're smart, and they are resourceful. So as long as you put all of the resources out, they will typically find things. We also have an excellent search box and all the best structure in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Developers just use the search box. I worked really hard on this navigation structure, and you don't care. And that's fine. I'm good with it. The way that we approached it at &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;...and our developer portal &lt;a href="https://developer.aiven.io/"&gt;developer.aiven.io&lt;/a&gt; is a greenfield project. So it's not been live very long, and it's still a little bit under construction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used existing best practice. So we took the &lt;a href="https://diataxis.fr/"&gt;Diátaxis framework&lt;/a&gt;,  which came originally from &lt;a href="https://www.divio.com/"&gt;Divio&lt;/a&gt;. You might know it also from the &lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django docs project&lt;/a&gt;. And it uses some very distinct content types that put the user front and center and thinks about what it is that the user is trying to achieve. So the content types of things like reference, looking up information, learning about something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you don't know what, for example, a &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; connection pool is, you can find out. And then if you need to set one up, then there's a separate piece which is like the task for that, which will link back to the explanation. But if you're already a senior and you know how to do it, then you feel like you're in the right place. And you could just go ahead and follow those linear tasks in that type of content that matches your need today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we really built on that existing model, and I think that has helped a lot also for consistency. This is the work of hundreds of hands. [laughter] And so there isn't one person keeping a strict voice on it. We're just keeping things consistent and trying to put it together for everyone that needs the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So the different types of content are connected. But in some ways, they're modularized so that if I don't need the explanatory text, I can get right into the nitty-gritty of how do I do it? But if I need the explanatory text and I may be a senior developer, but I may not have been familiar with this concept, whatever this concept is, I can easily find that explanatory text if I need it. Am I hearing that correctly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Exactly that. So there's like, I need to do a thing. And remember, no matter how senior you are, some of these things will be things that you need to do on a production database in an urgent manner, which I don't know about you but makes me stupid. [laughter] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we try and make it absolutely clear, here are the steps that you need to follow. Here is where you get your access token; here’s what you should type now. Like, here are the things to be aware of. And we try and just walk you through and knowing that whether you're a new person intimidated trying to learn something that feels big or a busy person with not much brain space, we've all been there fixing something between meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: All of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Somebody called out at 4:00 a.m. It doesn't matter. These instructions need to be as good as they can be for everybody. And I feel like that is how it includes everybody. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So I'm curious, do you ever write documentation only for a certain developer for, let's say, the senior developer? And if you do or if you don't, why not? And if you do, in what ways might that be different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: I do. I do write for just that senior developer. So you will never see this is how you use the dependency manager. This is how you create a directory. This is how you install &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;. Because if you're reading those instructions, &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;'s very detailed documentation is probably not the right place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn't be teaching you a beginner thing in any tech stack. If you come to us for highly available cloud database services, you probably know quite a lot about a lot. You might not know this thing, but we're not going to start at the beginning of the story because we'll lose you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I hope that there's enough there that somebody who vaguely has used &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/"&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt; before could be like, yes, I can go and read the instructions. I know which packages I need to install. So I'll go and read the docs for pip. I need it differently on my platform, so I'll go and look that up. And that's how developers put things together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think it's important for us to keep the scope pretty small for each of the different pieces. And the things that don't belong to us are the beginner things. If you don't know how to write &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp"&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;, you are on the wrong documentation site. Then they find their way, and they put things together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I've tried to just really keep focus on yes, our main customers are pretty experienced developers who need a platform like ours at the kind of scale that we run it. And I keep them in mind. So yeah, I skip the intro, so you know you're in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So it's an assumed knowledge of where you're starting from is, in many ways, a differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah, I try to do that. And I think it really helps people to realize they're in the right place. I am assuming they do know how to use the &lt;a href="https://redis.io/topics/rediscli"&gt;Redis CLI&lt;/a&gt; tool. So it'll be like, you can connect with &lt;a href="https://redis.io/topics/rediscli"&gt;Redis CLI&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the command. If you've never heard of that, by all means, go and look that up. But I am not going to put the install instructions between you and the bug fix that you urgently need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: That makes a lot of sense. And then they look it up, and then they can come back to you when they've looked it up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: That makes a lot of sense. Something else I can geek out about a lot with you is docs portals. I love talking about docs portals as someone who's worked on one for three years. How did you come to the tech stack you chose for your docs portal? First of all, what is the tech stack you chose for the &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; docs portal, and why did you choose it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Okay, so we chose &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Python-based static site generator. And I chose it because &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;'s a Python shop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: That's a reasonable choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: It's a really short story. I knew that I wanted a markup type text-based &lt;a href="https://docs-as-co.de/"&gt;Docs as Code&lt;/a&gt;-type setup. And if you look, which you can't, but if you could have access to the &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; private repos, there are some very well structured documentation repos there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them do have &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;; some of them are just really well-organized folders of a markup format called &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;, which is absolutely mainstream in the Python community. And I looked at that, and I looked at who our contributors are, and they're mostly employees. So they're mostly Python developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: They're in-house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah. I mean, it's a public repo. So we do get contributions from outside, and I hope that we'll get more over time. So it's &lt;a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;; it’s &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;. And I also feel like it's really important that when you're choosing tools for an organization, it has to be something that they can be independent with. I hope &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; won't fire its DevRel team tomorrow. But it can safely operate a &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; project given the knowledge that it already has in-house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support team could probably fix it out of hours if they needed to. It deploys to &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; alongside all our main websites. So it's looking at what's the closest thing to what we already know? What's familiar to this audience? It's a bit like DevRel, meeting people where they're at. So although I hadn't used &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; before at all, it seemed like the right thing. And so far, I still think it's the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: I think that makes a lot of sense. You chose the resource that you had the best capability amongst your team and amongst the larger organization for. So that's a very legitimate decision for how you choose a docs portal. Are there things in it that you love? Because this is new to you, &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; is new to you. Are there things that you've really come to enjoy using it or something that stood out for you in &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Something that &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; has in common with, particularly the Python community. I came to it for the tech, for the code, but the community blows me away. It's the support. You're looking for a plugin, and there's always a plugin. You log a bug with the plugin, and it's always politely responded to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People just look out for one another; they help one another. Some random stranger will respond on your issue, and it feels very healthy. So yeah, I could tell you about all my favorite plugins in &lt;a href="https://stackshare.io/dcsil/sphinx"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt;, and that's cool, and these new themes or whatever. But yeah, I came for the tech and stayed for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Doesn't that say a lot? Because we talked about what makes a great community, and one of the things that makes great software is the community, and that makes us sustainable. I think you're testimony to that, that you've chosen to stay with it because of that warm, supportive community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I think people don't realize is you have had a bit of an incredible journey to the place you're at right now. How did you end up being in the role you're at in &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;? What was that like? I'm sure you could write an entire book on that journey. But if you can encapsulate how you are where you are right now, how did you end up there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Well, early in my career, I was a software developer for a really long time. And then I was freelance for a while. I was delivering some training. I was on the conference speaking circuit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I was only on the conference speaking circuit because I love to learn things. But conference tickets, if you're a junior or a mid-level developer, are totally out of reach. But they'll give you a ticket if you give a talk. So I was like, barter for your own knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [laughs] Incentivisation right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: I know. So I learned to speak at conferences, and I did a bunch of stuff. When I was freelance, I also wrote a couple of books. I'm an &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/"&gt;O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; author. And so you look at all those things. And I was running my own business. I did a bit of technical project management. What does it look like? It looks like developer relations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: And so I've been in DevRel for a little bit over five years. And I've done a bunch of different things but essentially databases and APIs. And I write, I speak, and I code. So really, a software engineer is really a back-end sort of scripting person. But I absolutely love to write. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I'm a very accomplished speaker, which says I'm good at it. But I don't love it in the same way that I love writing. But it's the most high-profile thing I do, so I'm well known for it. But I really feel like the writing is me, and it makes the biggest impact. And it's the thing I'm the most proud of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I came into DevRel. I've done a few different things within developer relations. I've built a couple of libraries for different things, or I've published some packages, published quite a lot of integrations, given a bunch of talks. I've worked on a couple of docs projects as well. And when I came to join &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; as to found the developer relations team, I joined as an individual contributor. And they hired two of us at the same time. But that was nearly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partway through the year, the question came in, "Would you be prepared to run that team?" So today, I run the team, run the strategy, do the hiring, look after the budgets, run the technical blog post content process, run the developer portal. And as you can, I imagine, Ben, because you've worked with me before, interfere on a bunch of other things that I think developers need me to advocate for them about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [laughs] Interfere is not the way I would put it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: I would put it that you have a way to find your voice being an advocate for people and the community across all the different sectors of the organization. And you don't feel constrained by your role to do so. Wherever the developer community, wherever developers' voices matter, you will be in that space. As someone who has worked with you firsthand, I can attest to that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to me. You described all the different things you do. But you do so many different types of work, a multiplicity of kind of content types and areas of work. Do you think that helps you manage going full circle? Do you think it helps you manage longevity you have in a place and your sustainability of that role for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: I hope so. I've only moved into this management role during the year. And I'll be honest; I’m still finding my feet. As an individual contributor, I think the range of skill sets is amazing for two reasons: one is content reuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, written content is the foundation stone. But there are lots of reasons to publish in other formats, to reach other people who prefer a different way. And so being able to write your own demo, and then write the docs, the landing pages, give the talks, record the videos, and whatever else and then hear the feedback from people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you publish whichever library for an API and then you go and demo it, and someone complains to you, then you're really in touch with those people. So I really enjoy not being siloed for a DevRel role. But also, the variety really helps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often talk about the seasons of DevRel, which are certain times of the year, we're difficult to get hold of because all of the events are in the second week in October for reasons that are still unclear to me after ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Just to keep us in the air all the time, basically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah, but then you find sometimes in the year you can go four or six weeks with no travel because there are no events. Now, why is that? And it's a bit different between geographies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I've come to think that the skills and the moving of the seasons, knowing right now we're doing a massive...the biggest piece of the docs migration is happening now in my team because we're all on the ground until the end of January. And that's like, boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: This is the time you're all present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: It's the winter season. Other people think there are holidays and disruption to work schedules. They're actually the least disruptive times. December is the right time to ask developer relations to do something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think that difference in skills but also the constant changing of the tides has really helped me with my longevity. And because it's quite flexible often, you can choose what you work on. If you have writer's block, there's always a bug to fix in a library. Then that has helped me to find the balance. The week that we moved house, I was incredibly, incredibly stressed. And I wrote almost a whole PHP database library. That's how my brain works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: That sounds like a perfectly suited brain for developer relations if I say so myself. [laughs]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: I like it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: That's amazing. As you're now shipping a whole chunk of the docs in what others call the holiday season, but DevRel calls the busy time for getting work done, how do you know you'll be successful? How do you measure yourself with documentation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yeah, this is a really tricky one. And part of the problem could be opportunity. With the &lt;a href="https://developer.aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven dev portal&lt;/a&gt;, it's really new. So I don't even have a baseline status, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: You don't have a baseline. It's brand new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: It hasn't been live that long. So we're migrating content off an older site that didn't really have content design but has really, really good information, just the format's a bit hit and miss, and some of it is outdated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Well, that's a problem as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: So being able to grab that and read old docs and try stuff and then produce new instructions or new resources that fit the new world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: So you're running through the old docs as you're doing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: Yes. So it's like a big migration; all the screenshots need updating and everything. You know &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; has 9 or 10 open-source data products on its platform. I'm getting to know all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: [chuckles] In this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: It's like the best study ever. So yeah, how are we successful? I mean, getting the migration done is a big one because there are lots of new resources that I want to build. But because we're now in the middle of the migration, we're confusing people by having stuff in multiple locations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the initial set of success is...in developer relations, we'd call this activity metrics. Like, is a thing done? I would like to move it forward to be did people find what they were looking for? How many searches didn't return anything? Or how many...we've got feedback, and it's a public project. So &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/issues"&gt;GitHub issues&lt;/a&gt; for why don't you have this in Java, and those types of things are further down the line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our success will be measured by do people contribute to this? It is a community project. We know that we have awesome, active community members at &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;. Is it something that we can all work on together? Do our colleagues contribute, and do they find that easy? Because advocacy is so often internal, enabling what happens inside the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, there are a lot of things there. The documentation is not part of the funnel. We report to marketing. So I get into some hilarious meetings where I'm like, no, that is not what is happening here. And so yes, maybe clicking through, but I always think it's more important that people click through from the web interface into the docs to learn something. I would rather see that than necessarily going the other way into the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben: Than the other way. I think that's a really good perspective. And I also really like how you said that your goals will move as the project matures. And what success looks like is going to change through the lifecycle of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, you're managing the liminality of being between the two different platforms. And it's trying to figure out how successful you are and keeping your users not utterly confused between the old and the new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then what you said at the end where I might manage and look to manage some metrics around community engagement with the docs. And are people contributing? I don't think a lot of places think enough about that, what that means, that I have something out there in the open. Is the larger user base running &lt;a href="https://aiven.io/"&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt;? Is it actually using it or not? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they bringing back into it their shared learnings, their frustrations, and how they overcame it? And maybe in this doc, if you wrote it this way, and raising an issue or raising a pull request, or what have you. I think that's a really good and, I think, fascinating metric to actually ponder on for a little bit as well. Amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt;, I want to thank you for your time. This has been a journey through burnout, and through documentation, and talking about open-source culture and what it can bring into our working cultures and docs portals. It's been wonderful. Thank you so much, Lorna, for joining us on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PolyglotShow"&gt;Polyglot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorna: It's my pleasure. Thanks so much for having me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonan: Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. You can find the show notes for this episode along with all of the rest of The Relicans podcasts on &lt;a href="https://therelicans.com"&gt;therelicans.com&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, most anything The Relicans get up to online will be on that site. We'll see you next week. Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Introduction to Tech Debt (And Why It Can Change Your Career)</title>
      <author>Michael Mangialardi</author>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 14:57:26 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/michaelmangial1/an-introduction-to-tech-debt-and-why-it-can-change-your-career-381m</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have found much success with a simple planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every season, I jot down a list of goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week, I jot down a list of things I want to get done that help me accomplish everyday tasks and work towards my seasonal goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, I prioritize from items from the weekly list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have a &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt; list. A list of projects and goals that I would like to do at some undetermined time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--522NXxkm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w0pbhg9wgyrcnnsapo55.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--522NXxkm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w0pbhg9wgyrcnnsapo55.png" alt="introduction to tech debt" width="880" height="585"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software development, &lt;em&gt;tech debt&lt;/em&gt; is basically the "someday" list of your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a collection of things that would be ideal to get done but are not prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-log-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why log it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that's tech debt in a gist, but why should developers bother with tracking it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't track it, you have to rely solely upon your memory. At some point or another, our memories will fail us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps communicate that ideal work is worth doing, even if we're ok with not doing it right this second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides assurance that if you can't do the ideal things now that you can still be able to do them later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to generate a longterm vision and goal of a codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-i-log-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do I log it?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever works. I tend to create a wiki page in the GitHub repository of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-do-i-log-exactly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What do I log exactly?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, tech debt is anything that you'd like to do someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, this includes upgrading dependencies, implementing new design patterns, refactoring a decent portion of the code, automating manual tasks, adopting new technologies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Upgrade to Next v12&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;...etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-i-know-whether-something-is-a-someday-ideal-or-a-present-requirement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do I know whether something is a "someday" ideal or a present requirement?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the million dollar question. There is no right answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot provide a detailed blueprint, but I can provide a couple guiding principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the thought of doing it "someday" is stressful, it likely should be done in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have time to do it? If not, then you either need to negotiate for time or accept the less-than-ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-do-i-get-it-prioritizeddone"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How do I get it prioritized/done?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, the concept of a "someday" list doesn't sound all that assuring. There can be memories of previous "someday" items that never seen the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While thinking of tech debt as a "someday" list is the easiest way to describe it, perhaps it is more appropriate to think of it as a kanban board of "stretch goals."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wOxS_d2d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o2aadpbs5affgo9bz2ni.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wOxS_d2d--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/o2aadpbs5affgo9bz2ni.png" alt="introduction to tech debt" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Stretch goals" are things that you prioritize to get done but don't have to get done for you to sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I have found that the best time to prioritize tech debt is around the lifecycle of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech debt should be treated as stretch goals added to the main requirements of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer on a product team, then you usually have a cadence of 1) planning for a project, 2) starting a project, and 3) wrapping up a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K8rPGPop--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xcgusaxq6nqxudv4xuel.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K8rPGPop--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xcgusaxq6nqxudv4xuel.png" alt="introduction to tech debt" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you plan a project, you can prioritize a few interesting tech debt items to be completed thorough the project (although treating them as stretch goals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it's best to treat them as stretch goals, I would recommend padding your estimates for a project with them in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not stretch goals because they shouldn't be accounted for in estimate. Rather, they are stretch goals because they can be the first things scope needs to be cut in an unexpected event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to prioritizing tech debt items in the project planning phase, I have also found that a good time to do them is as soon as a project wraps up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, the end of a project is a slower time where a launched project is being monitored and the next project is getting finalized for planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this slower time, take full advantage to complete tech debt items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#final-tips"&gt;

  Final Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-it-is-nice-when-a-team-has-a-formal-expectationprocess-for-completing-tech-debt-items-around-projects-but-take-initiative-even-if-such-a-formal-process-does-not-exist-with-time-you-may-be-able-to-advocate-for-things-to-be-formalized"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. It is nice when a team has a formal expectation/process for completing tech debt items around projects, but take initiative even if such a formal process does not exist. With time, you may be able to advocate for things to be formalized.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-tackle-tech-debt-items-in-separate-pull-requests-that-way-reviewers-can-treat-it-separately-from-the-musthave-project-pull-requests"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Tackle tech debt items in separate pull requests. That way, reviewers can treat it separately from the must-have project pull requests.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-keep-track-of-completed-tech-debt-items"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Keep track of completed tech debt items.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with a todo list, I like to see the work that I've accomplished. And, tracking every task that is done can bring a rewarding sense of accomplishment, or it can be an indicator that work needs to be delegated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completed tech debt items are also great things to include in your yearly reviews, resumes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-take-pride-in-your-craft"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Take pride in your craft.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding is a craft. Tech debt is a way of improving your craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though managers may not see (nor ask) about the technical details of your craft, focusing on your craft by making the code ideal will help you stay motivated and relevant for future career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't get me wrong, people don't need to know the technical details to see the value of someone who is taking their craft seriously and improving a team because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-find-ways-to-share-your-tech-debt-work-with-peers"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Find ways to share your tech debt work with peers.
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.michaelmang.dev/blog/the-developers-content-model"&gt;The Developer's Content Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, you take the things you are working on and present them to others in unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can present your work to a global audience by tweeting things you learned, sharing gists, recording videos, and/or writing blog posts on the work you've done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see people of a global audience take interest in your learnings, it can be very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it helps you build a portfolio. Even for your current role, you can take tweets and blog posts and repurpose them as documentation for your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also present your work to a broader audience within your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iIqlyWLv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kddta4v467jdecemfpcf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iIqlyWLv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kddta4v467jdecemfpcf.png" alt="introduction to tech debt" width="880" height="587"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good way to do this is by either doing a tech talk (gather a group of engineers and present your learnings in a 15-30 minute slide deck presentation) and/or by doing a &lt;a href="https://www.michaelmang.dev/blog/code-show-and-tell"&gt;show-and-tell&lt;/a&gt; (gather a group of engineers and have everyone take up to 5-10 minutes to highlight something you learned recently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you can see that tech debt is much more than tracking "we really should have done this but we couldn't so maybe we'll get to it but probably not" type of items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech debt is a powerful way to improve a codebase, develop your craft, and gain influence and respect among peers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/atordvairn/deploying-a-nextjs-app-on-vercel-503f</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BoTDIl_H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://assets.vercel.com/image/upload/q_auto/front/assets/design/white-nextjs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BoTDIl_H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://assets.vercel.com/image/upload/q_auto/front/assets/design/white-nextjs.png" alt="next.js logo" width="880" height="503"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
vercel is the best platform to deploy and test your next.js application. Let's see how you can deploy there for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for this, you'll need to have one account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vercel.com/"&gt;vercel&lt;/a&gt; (ofc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first of all, make a git repository with a next.js project&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-next-app
git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#now-install-vercel-globally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Now install vercel globally:
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; vercel
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;
yarn add &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; vercel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#deploy-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  deploy !
&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vercel
? Set up and deploy “~/web/my-new-project”? &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Y/n] y
? Which scope &lt;span class="k"&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? my-new-project
? In which directory is your code located? my-new-project/
Auto-detected project settings &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Next.js&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:
- Build Command: &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;next build&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;build&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;package.json&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
- Output Directory: Next.js default
- Development Command: next dev &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--port&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PORT&lt;/span&gt;
? Want to override the settings? &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;y/N]


&lt;span class="c"&gt;# and for production&lt;/span&gt;
vercel &lt;span class="nt"&gt;--prod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
