      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The serverless computing model&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to build and run applications and services without having to worry about infrastructure or servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, scaling, and capacity provisioning. In this blog article, I would like to give you an overview of some fully-managed serverless services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which can be used to create fully cloud-native serverless applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building native serverless applications means that developers can focus on the &lt;strong&gt;core product&lt;/strong&gt; and on &lt;strong&gt;innovating applications and solutions&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than spending a lot of time on setting up and maintaining infrastructure. This results in many benefits such as faster development, simplified operational management, scaling, and reduction in operational costs. Take a look at my last blogpost to get an impression on serverless architectures and how they impact the development process and the project business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how can we actually implement these serverless applications? What tools and services should I use to create a highly-available, scalable and performant backend solution? How can I benefit from managed infrastructure, variable operational costs that scale with my business? How can I increase speed and agility in my development process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ac4qhpW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hvpqein4enwo53ft7geo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ac4qhpW2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hvpqein4enwo53ft7geo.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Background: I am Cloud , DevOps &amp;amp; Big Data Enthusiast | 4x AWS Certified | 3x OCI Certified | 3x Azure Certified .&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS provides a wide range of different cloud services (&amp;gt;165) which cover all aspects and requirements of backend solutions, like compute resources, different storage types, purpose-built databases, security services for authentication and encryption, big data stream processing, machine learning, messaging and monitoring services, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These services are tightly integrated with each other and provide a convenient way to build your application in a flexible and powerful way. This blogpost will give you an overview of the most important serverless services of AWS. In the second part i will sketch some scenario use-cases demonstrating how you can use them to create serverless applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of serverless AWS services&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4QbpVuVQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c203zd5t2tg8t8hxhs4w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4QbpVuVQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c203zd5t2tg8t8hxhs4w.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compute provides you with the execution environment for your application code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With AWS Lambda&lt;/strong&gt;, you can execute code as a function triggered by various event sources like, e.g., HTTP requests on AWS API Gateway, file updates on S3, or metric alarms in AWS Cloudwatch. Lambda is the FaaS solution from AWS where you can run code for any type of application or backend service. It runs the code on a fully-managed, high-available infrastructure and performs all administration tasks of the compute resources, including server and system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. You pay only for the compute time your application actually consumes. Lambda can be combined with many other AWS services and is used in many scenarios, like authorizing a HTTP request by validating a JSON web token, real-time filtering and transforming streaming data, processing data in S3, managing database handling, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--824CvcGM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hwceran5uneaz0pumash.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--824CvcGM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hwceran5uneaz0pumash.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With AWS Fargate&lt;/strong&gt;, you can run docker containers without any management of servers or clusters. It is a container orchestration solution that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. You don’t need to define EC2 instance types, manage cluster scheduling, optimize server utilization, or define cloud watch metrics to scale the instances. Fargate manages the infrastructure needed to run your containers in a highly-available manner. To launch your application, you need to package your containers, specify CPU and memory requirements, and define networking and IAM policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h9KKhFbw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0e5lbkv748iy4o0p62g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h9KKhFbw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0e5lbkv748iy4o0p62g.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#messaging"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Messaging
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can send notifications between various services, applications, devices and platforms over multiple transport protocols. SNS allows you to publish messages from one application to a large number of subscribers for parallel processing. Besides push notifications to mobile devices, you can deliver notifications by email, SMS, SQS, Lambda, or to any HTTP endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed distributed message queueing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservice distributed systems and serverless applications. You can send, receive and cache messages between software components to resolve issues introduced by the producer-consumer problem. SQS offers two types of message queues: Standard queues have maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. Additionally, you can use FIFO queues, which guarantee exactly-once message delivery with strict order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fge6sSOg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrzonqlyon7785xhgvuu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fge6sSOg--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mrzonqlyon7785xhgvuu.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#integration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Integration
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon API Gateway&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. It handles the processing of up to hundreds of thousands concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization, access control, and API version management. You can create your API within the management console UI and access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on EC2 or code running in a Lambda function. You pay only for the API calls you receive and for the amount of outgoing data, transmitted by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With AWS Step Functions&lt;/strong&gt;, you can orchestrate the components of your application as a series of steps to create complex serverless workflows using Lambda functions. The workflow is modeled as a state machine diagram, where each state represents a component of the application. Using a graphical viewer, you can visualize these components and check the execution flow in real time. All steps are automatically triggered, tracked and retried in case of errors, so that the application executes in order and as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#security"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Security
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Cognito&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed, scalable, and cost-effective sign-up/sign-in service, which provides user authentication, authorization, and management for web and mobile applications. The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. A user pool is a user directory, which provides sign-up and sign-in services, based on its own or an external identity provider that implements the SAML, OAuth2, or OpenID Connect protocol, like Facebook or Google. You can use a customizable web UI for the user sign-in, which can be integrated in your existing webpage. With an identity pool, your authorized user or anonymous guest can exchange user pool tokens for temporary AWS credentials to access AWS resources. Based on IAM role policies, you can grant your users or groups fine-grained access to your resources or AWS services. Cognito has advanced security features, such as e-mail, phone verification, and multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Key Management Service (KMS)&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed service which allows you to create and manage your security keys and control the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. KMS is integrated with many AWS services to simplify encryption handling across your application. It enables developers to easily add encryption functionality to the application, either directly through the service APIs or with the AWS Encryption SDK. Customer master keys (CMK) are used to control access to data encryption keys that encrypt and decrypt the data. You can provide and manage your own CMK including your custom cryptographic material or using a CMK provided and managed by AWS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With AWS CloudHSM&lt;/strong&gt; you can additionally use a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. The encryption keys that you generate and use with CloudHSM are accessible only by the HSM users that you specify. AWS has no visibility or access to your encryption keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#monitoring"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS CloudWatch&lt;/strong&gt; is a monitoring and management service for AWS resources and custom applications. CloudWatch enables you to collect metrics and logs from all your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. It provides real-time monitoring and visibility into resource utilization of your EC2 instances, your applications’ performance, and operational health. CloudWatch is natively integrated with many AWS services that can publish detailed metrics with up to 1 second granularity. Additionally, you can define alarms based on CloudWatch metrics and perform actions based on its value. You can, e.g., set a threshold on a key utilization metrics and trigger an automated auto scaling action to add or remove EC2 instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Quicksight&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed business intelligence service, which allows you to create visualisations of data and to design interactive dashboards for application analysis. These dashboards can be accessed from any mobile device or browser. You can embed them into your applications, portals or websites, providing you with powerful self-service analytics. QuickSight allows you to connect to and import data from a wide variety of cloud or on-premises data sources and scales to tens of thousands of users without any infrastructure to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#database"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Database
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/strong&gt; is a NoSQL database service which supports key-value pairs and document data structures. As it is a fully-managed service, you don’t have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, backups, software patching, or cluster scaling. It provides features like high availability and durability, automatic and infinite read-write I/O scaling, on demand backup with point-in-time recovery, encryption at rest, and single-digit millisecond latency. With its pay-per-use pricing model and integration with many other AWS services, DynamoDB is a great database service for many serverless application on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully-managed relational database engine that’s compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. It automates and standardizes database clustering and replication to remove time-consuming administration tasks, like hardware provisioning, storage autoscaling, database setup, patching, and backups. Aurora is also available as an on-demand configuration, called Aurora Serverless, with autoscaling for compute capacity, which is a cost-effective way to support infrequent and unpredictable workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#analytics"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Analytics
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Kinesis&lt;/strong&gt; is a is fully-managed and highly scalable streaming service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data, such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, application logs, IoT telemetry data, or location-tracking events. It enables you to process and analyze data as it arrives and to respond instantly, so that you can create real-time applications. Amazon Kinesis consists of 3 services, which can be used to process the streaming data. &lt;strong&gt;With Amazon Kinesis Data Streams&lt;/strong&gt;, you can ingest and store large data streams in real-time without managing the infrastructure, storage, networking, and configuration. Applications can consume data from a stream, so that multiple actions, like data analysis, archiving, or processing, can take place concurrently and independently. &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to load streaming data into data lakes (Amazon Redshift), data stores (S3), and analytics tools (Amazon Elasticsearch). It allows you to to capture, transform, and load (ETL) streaming data in real-time from many data sources simultaneously and send it automatically to the specified destination. &lt;strong&gt;With Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; you can filter, aggregate, and transform streaming data for advanced analytics. You can run standard SQL queries against streaming data to perform time series analytics, provide data to real-time dashboards, and extract metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Athena&lt;/strong&gt; is a query service which provides a standard SQL language to analyze large-scale datasets in AWS Simple Storage Service (S3). There is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the executed queries. Athena scales automatically by executing queries in parallel. This makes it simple to do ad-hoc analysis or more complex analysis that contain large joins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS provides many services which can be used as building blocks to create cloud infrastructures for virtually any workload. Solution architects and developers have a huge range of tools and services to design and implement backend applications in a very effective way with great flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most services provided by AWS are fully-managed and can be used without time-consuming administrative tasks, infrastructure provisioning or server maintenance. Developers can focus on creating their core applications, which increases development speed and business growth. Important aspects like high availability, automatic scalability, security, and durability are built in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a huge advantage compared to using open-source services hosted on manually provisioned server infrastructures. With the pay-as-you-go pricing model you have no upfront costs or long-term contracts and pay only for the consumed resources, which makes serverless architectures very cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serverless vs Containerization model</title>
      <author>Piyush Mattoo</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 03:02:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/gpmattoo/serverless-vs-containerization-model-56i3</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/gpmattoo/serverless-vs-containerization-model-56i3</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fargate gives us best of both the worlds (serverless as well as container) and it won’t restrict us as Lambda might. Lambda works well when run in asynchronous manner (event driven) say object was uploaded to S3 and some Lambda got triggered as a result. API Gateway integrated with Lambda for request/response model especially for runtime like dot-net (for cold-start) can be problematic for synchronous traffic like web APIs in case milliseconds matter.&lt;br&gt;
Lambda is not multi-threaded so say if Lambda service receives 10 requests then Lambda service will launch 10 Lambdas running our code (ASP.NET  entry point), some of those instances might not be warmed up or ready. That’s where (web traffic, request/response synchronous) Fargate shines as its serverless and it takes those 10 requests and run them on the same container so there is no overhead of launching the lambda container impacting performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do need to keep in mind that there is a learning curve for containers, perhaps ECS is less of a learning curve than EKS but operationally we need a team which knows Kubernetes well. When we run Kubernetes in EKS we are still talking about authentication with IAM and AWS's ELB, VPC and perhaps we integrate with S3, DynamoDB and at that point we are already committed to AWS. Hybrid cloud is good if we are running different applications on different cloud providers but not the same application such that at any given moment we can pick it up and drop it in Azure, Openshift OnPrem, GCP unless we build the application to the lowest common denominator of all the cloud providers and don’t take any advantage of any of the good things cloud providers have to provide. In other words if we just use block storage, http APIs and we ran our own databases on VMs we are fine but then we are not taking advantage of the cloud native features that any cloud provider might provide you. That’s typically not the case.&lt;br&gt;
Other consideration is Kubernetes operates in quarterly fashion for releases, only supports n-2 i.e. two revisions behind current version. For larger companies that doesn’t adapt to changes very well, we need to keep this in mind as there will be breaking changes as Kubernetes gains more maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A book can characterize an individual's inclination and knowledge. On the off chance that you are a coder, you ought to be additionally a decent peruser on the grounds that it builds up the brain and the psyche is your weapon.  You need to prepare it day by day. Prior to discovering any answer for an issue Reading and understanding the issues is the most significant in the event that you are a coder or any difficult solver. Without great perusing and appreciation abilities, an individual sets aside more effort to comprehend the issues prior to tackling it. &lt;/p&gt;

This book genuinely is a work of art and for all individuals who has some information around IT this is an unquestionable requirement perused. ( Not saying non-specialized people cannot appreciate it ..... however, for IT people, I trust it will be considerably more charming)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a remarkable book! I have perused such countless books as a feature of my self-awareness yet I generally find that writers wind up extolling themselves all through persistently continuing forever about their own accomplishments. Indeed you finish the book feeling siphoned up partially and feeling like you as well, can be a whiz just to end up in a similar spot seven days after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is totally extraordinary, a straightforward, rational viable piece with fabulous takeaways which anybody can apply so effectively to find a place with their way of life. It is so orderly in it's methodology thus clear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep work is a book for everybody albeit the writer accentuates it for information laborers. As I would like to think it is for money managers who needs to accomplish their objectives in their furious timetable, educators (resources) who needs to seek after explore notwithstanding their scholastic obligations, or a business person who needs to expand the profitability and innovativeness of the group, or simply some arbitrary person who needs to invest some quality energy with family yet can't. Books assists you with creating self-restraint. This book can best be put among books like Outliers/Mastery/Flow/Peak and so forth where significance of work and it's ramifications are clarified. Just thing is Deep work is more point by point as far as methodologies and touch less on brain science considers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book that I decide to peruse consistently not long prior to Eating the Frog and it's really a piece of my Miracle Morning. Every single section is very short yet mind you, the Content is incredibly acceptable. You should simply peruse the entire book once and plan your Goal and Plan of activity following the standards lying in the book and attempt to peruse atleast 1 section/rule consistently and in a matter of seconds you will be the place where you need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book will show not about codes, in some cases you can peruse but rather the fundamental thought is to be a superior developer and think better, break the issues, consider calculation without help from anyone else. There isn't a lot to say, see the primary version was composed 20 years prior and when you begin perusing you see the nature of the book. Its separated in certain themes inside certain subjects. You can peruse by look or follow cover as far as possible. This book doesn't have a particular language or a 'formula' to follow, really it will open your brain to think better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is only 88 pages, yet experiences are helpful for any computer programmer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At whatever point I go over strong explanations in the book, I would sit and think for 2 minutes to associate with my programming experience. More often than not I had the option to think of substantial model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is energetically suggested for developers who had invested huge energy perusing different software engineers code. On the off chance that you are an accomplished developer you can think about the focuses in the books as to approve your present convictions. I will in general concur on the entirety of the focuses referenced in the book and associate with open source projects in certain and negative sense. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know how javascript code runs in the javascript engine? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, then I hope this post will be useful for understanding execution context and how the order of execution context is maintained by call stack.This fundamental concept also pays way to have the foundation to comprehend hoisting, scopes, scope chains, and closures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets start,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving deep into the concept, we must have the basic understanding that &lt;code&gt;Javascript is synchronous and single threaded&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.Synchrounous - control waits until the particular code 
                 is executed and only then it moves to the 
                 next line.
2.Single threaded - only one call stack(explained below)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ie) During memory creation phase and code execution phase in the Execution context, js code is executed line by line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;From here onwards I will be addressing execution context as EC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever we run a javascript code, a global EC is created, which comprises mainly of two phases,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory creation phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code execution or thread of execution phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain this with a simple example,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before when we run this code, a global EC is created and the memory creation phase starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ui49CrOn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yzxhzch70awih1zbamdg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ui49CrOn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yzxhzch70awih1zbamdg.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fl0SW7XU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/atd7r5yx8cgme6epngoe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fl0SW7XU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/atd7r5yx8cgme6epngoe.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Memory creation phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase is mainly about allocating memory for the variables and functions declared in the code.The js engine looks for the variables and functions from the first line synchronously.  It is important to note that during this phase,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  1. For variables, a special keyword - undefined is 
     initialized by default
  2. For functions, the function code is copied as it is.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the above example variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;isColorPrinted&lt;/code&gt; is initialized with keyword &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; and for the &lt;code&gt;Square&lt;/code&gt; function, &lt;code&gt;function code&lt;/code&gt; is copied as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very important to understand this, because it will be easy to understand why variable hoisting happens in js, which I will be covering in the another post😉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Code execution phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the memory creation phase, the code gets executed right from the first line synchronously. So in the above example, the assignment &lt;code&gt;a = 5&lt;/code&gt; replaces &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in memory.When the control reaches the function invocation &lt;code&gt;Square(a)&lt;/code&gt; a new EC is created within the global EC. Again for the new EC it has to repeat two phases. After memory creation and code execution phase are over, the value returned will be assigned to&lt;code&gt;isColorPrinted&lt;/code&gt;in the memory part of global EC and newly created EC will be permantly deleted,If anymore function invocation happens then a new EC is created.For nested function,an EC will be created within the parent EC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z92ar_Ud--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ys7b6wrh9cpwv32rsps9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z92ar_Ud--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ys7b6wrh9cpwv32rsps9.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for deeply nested functions and other complex scenarios it becomes really tough to manage the execution contexts, so here comes to our aid - &lt;code&gt;call Stack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call stack is responsible for managing the order of exection of EC's. When the js code runs, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    1. Initially:
       the global EC is pushed into the stack.

    2. After a function invocation:
       The newly created EC is pushed on top of the global 
       EC,

    3. When function execution is over: 
       It pops the EC out of the stack.

    4  When the entire program is executed: 
       It pops the global EC out of the stack.

     For nested functions:
       The child EC is pushed on top of the parent EC.

     For infinite loop: 
       Call stack crashes as it is completely filled with 
       EC's and max memory is reached
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this was insightful! Let me know in the comments .&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top Utility Packages In Javascript</title>
      <author>Sudarshan Sawandkar</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 02:42:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sudarshansb143/top-utility-packages-in-javascript-2cp7</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sudarshansb143/top-utility-packages-in-javascript-2cp7</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  📢 TL:DR :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all seek for utility packages on &lt;em&gt;npm&lt;/em&gt;. No Matter we admire it or not, everyone (once a day or many times a day ) needs some &lt;strong&gt;UTILITY&lt;/strong&gt;. So Here is the list of some utility packages which makes your life a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%9B%A0-papa-parse-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🛠 Papa Parse :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the great package when we deal with files. Consider a scenario, you are building a automation system, which query's the data from third party API and process it internally and outputs processed data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During your development, you want to process massive amount of CSV data, then *&lt;em&gt;Papa Parse *&lt;/em&gt; is your  🗡Go-to Man 🗡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CSVdata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCSVContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getCSVContentURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;papaParse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;CSVdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ParsedData is  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parsedData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, after await() call, we are getting CSV file, which contains the data. Once we got the data, I used papa parse and Papa parse give me the array of objects (In my case) pretty easily without any jargon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is whole lot more functionality you can &lt;a href="https://www.papaparse.com/docs"&gt; use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#puppteer"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  💻 Puppteer:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppteer is the browser automation tool. It is a pretty similar as compared to Selenium or any other automation tool. But, advantage of Puppeteer, it provides wide variety of functionality with respect to headless chromium browser and lower level DOM API's &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about it then, I have a article regarding usage of Puppteer take a look at it  👉👉 &lt;a href="https://dev.to/sudarshansb143/productivity-hacks-using-puppeteer-81d"&gt;Here &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cheerio-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ⚡ Cheerio ⚡:
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheerio can be used with puppeteer. Cheerio parses the available html data and gives us the ability to interact with data and extract the useful information. It can act as parser, if you are building the 🔍 SEO scrapper 🔍 or the Resume scrapper for your organization&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cheerio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cheerio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

     &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//jquery style&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;cheerio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//use $ to interact with elements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#gcl-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  GCL :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCL is the short form for the get-current-line. It is my favorite package. It is totally optionally to use but, if you have project where you have to implement :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging specific events to the database &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting the line number, where the specific code is executed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you must use it. It does nothing but gives you the current line of code with very simplistic API&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;          &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; Getting current line number &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentLineNumber&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;gcl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple :) &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#proxy-chain-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🤑 Proxy Chain 🤑 :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you want to apply the proxy to your nodejs, then use it undoubtedly. Proxy chain provides us the  way to interact the proxy with pretty  simple way. It generates the new proxy URL which you can put into the configuration  and then we are good to go &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the example usage of proxy chain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;newProxyUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxyChain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anonymizeProxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;proxyUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;launchConfigObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;--no-sandbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;--disable-setuid-sandbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`--proxy-server=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;newProxyUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;proxy executed ....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the example of proxy chain with puppeteer. While doing automation, applying proxy is non-written rule. In the above snippet, I have used &lt;em&gt;anonymizeProxy()&lt;/em&gt; API of proxy chain which builds ready to use proxy URL for us.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%F0%9F%96%8D-chalk-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🖍 Chalk  :-
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are the fan of doing the colorful stuff in the terminal then this is for you. Chalk provides the API's which makes our terminal colorful and it is pretty  light weight and flexible to use. we can directly put it into native javascript API's like &lt;em&gt;console.log&lt;/em&gt; and  use it comprehensively&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7x9ikEZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hhnoke6ebzx71g0zkhy9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--D7x9ikEZ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hhnoke6ebzx71g0zkhy9.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the example of chalk used with the &lt;em&gt;morgan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#morgan-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🏏Morgan :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan is used as the logger for the nodejs server it is pretty helpful to interact with the incoming requests and  all these stuff happening inside the nodejs. It gives us the prebuilt modification of request logging. if you used&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;morgan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then it will run in developer mode and will log pretty helpful information regarding request like *execution time *, *response code * etc&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#%E2%98%80-final-thoughts-%E2%98%80-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ☀ Final Thoughts ☀ :
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These is the list of 0.00000001 % of npm packages which are available to use. Using packages is pretty much optional and preference based. but, using them saves us from *Re implementing the Wheel *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, let me know in comments if you know any other utility packages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks For Reading  🙏&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/thaisandre/programacao-assincrona-2g48</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quando fazemos uma ligação telefônica para uma pessoa para passar uma mensagem, dependemos de outra ação que é a da pessoa atender a chamada. Vamos tentar representar isso em código utilizando a linguagem JavaScript:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu faço a chamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a pessoa atende e diz alô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu digo alguma informação&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A saída será:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;eu faço a chamada
a pessoa atende e diz alô
eu digo alguma informação
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#callbacks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Callbacks
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na realidade, a pessoa não atende a mensagem imediatamente, ela pode demorar alguns segundos para atender. Podemos representar essa "demora" através da função &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; que executa uma função após determinado espaço de tempo. Ela recebe dois argumentos - o primeiro é a função que representa a ação a ser executada e o segundo o valor em milisegundos representando o tempo mínimo de espera para que ela seja executada:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a pessoa atende e diz alô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Como resultado, após 3 segundos, temos:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;a pessoa atende e diz alô
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora vamos utilizar este recurso no nosso exemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu faço a chamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a pessoa atende e diz alô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu digo alguma informação&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;saída:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;eu faço a chamada
eu digo alguma informação
a pessoa atende e diz alô
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note que nosso programa apresenta alguns problemas. A pessoa que fez a chamada (no caso, eu) acaba dizendo alguma coisa antes da outra pessoa antender. Ou seja, a execução não aconteceu de maneira &lt;strong&gt;síncrona&lt;/strong&gt;, mantendo a ordenação esperada. O conteúdo dentro de &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; não foi executado após a primeira chamada de &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isso acontece porque o Javascript é &lt;em&gt;single-thread&lt;/em&gt;. O que quer dizer, a grosso modo, que possui uma &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt; principal de execução do programa e executa um comando por vez, do início ao fim, sem interrupções. No momento em que cada operação é processada, nada mais pode acontecer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acabamos de ver que seu funcionamento é diferente quando o programa encontra a função &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt;. O método &lt;code&gt;setTimeout&lt;/code&gt; pertence ao módulo &lt;code&gt;timers&lt;/code&gt; que contém funções que executam algum código após um determinado período de tempo. Não é necessário importar este módulo no node.js já que todos estes métodos estão disponíveis globalmente para simular o &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide/In_depth"&gt;JavaScript Runtime Environment&lt;/a&gt; dos navegadores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chamada da função que passamos como primeiro argumento para o &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; é enviada para outro contexto, chamado WEBApi que define um &lt;em&gt;timer&lt;/em&gt; com o valor que passamos como segundo argumento (3000) e arguarda este tempo para colocar a chamada da função na &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt; principal para ser executada - ocorre um agendamento desta execução. Porém, este agendamento só é concretizado após a stack principal ser limpa, ou seja, após todo código síncrono ser executado. Por este motivo, a terceira e última chamada de &lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt; é chamada antes da segunda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A função que passamos como primeiro argumento para o método &lt;code&gt;setTimeout()&lt;/code&gt; é chamada de função &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt;. Uma função &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; é toda função passada como argumento para outra função que de fato vai executá-la. Esta execução pode ser imediata, ou seja, executada de maneira síncrona. No entando, &lt;em&gt;callbacks&lt;/em&gt; são normalmente utilizados para continuar a execução de um código em outro momento na linha do tempo, ou seja, de maneira &lt;strong&gt;assíncrona&lt;/strong&gt;. Isso é bastante útil quando temos eventos demorados e não queremos travar o restante do programa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nosso código ainda tem problemas. A pessoa que faz a ligação quer apenas dizer alguma coisa após a outra pessoa atender a chamada. Podemos refatorar o código da seguinte maneira:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fazChamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu faço a chamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pessoaAtende&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a pessoa atende e diz alô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;euDigoAlgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu digo alguma informação&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fazChamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pessoaAtende&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;euDigoAlgo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Podemos definir um tempo de espera maior para dizer algo na chamada, mas ainda assim não sabemos ao certo o quanto a pessoa vai demorar para atender. Se ela atender imediatamente, vai demorar para receber a mensagem e desligar a chamada sem que isso aconteça. Além de ser bastante ruim e trabalhoso ficar configurando os tempos de cada execução, o código fica muito grande e confuso com muitas condicionais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#promises"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Promises
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para nossa sorte, o Javascript possui um recurso chamado &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt; que representa, como seu nome sugere, uma promessa de algo que será executado futuramente. Como a execução que esperamos pode falhar, este recurso também ajuda muito nos tratamentos de erros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segundo o &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises"&gt;Wikipédia&lt;/a&gt;, um &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt; atua como representante de um resultado que é, inicialmente, desconhecido devido a sua computação não estar completa no momento de sua chamada. Vamos contruir um objeto &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt; para entender como ele funciona:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Isso vai gerar um &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt; com a mensagem &lt;em&gt;"TypeError: Promise resolver is not a function"&lt;/em&gt;. Um objeto &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt; precisa receber uma função para resolver um valor. Ou seja, precisamos passar uma função &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; para executar algo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Este código imprime o valor 5. Agora vamos imprimir o próprio objeto &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saída:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;5
Promise { &amp;lt;pending&amp;gt; }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note que executou o &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt;, mas seu estado está pendente. Toda vez que criamos um objeto &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;, seu estado inicial é pendente já que representa a promessa de algo que será resolvido no futuro. Neste caso, como o &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; será executado de maneira síncrona, vai imprimir o resultado de sua execução. E, portanto, não é útil neste caso específico. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pode acontecer do &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; executar o processamento de um valor que será necessário no futuro. Para que este valor esteja disponível, será preciso que a promessa seja &lt;strong&gt;resolvida&lt;/strong&gt; através da função anônima &lt;code&gt;resolve()&lt;/code&gt; que cria uma nova promessa com o valor realizado. Exemplo:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;var p = new Promise((resolve) =&amp;gt; {
    resolve(5);
});
console.log(p);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saída:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Promise { 5 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agora a promessa não está mais pendente, ela foi resolvida e embrulha o valor 5. Isso quer dizer que tudo deu certo. Porém, ainda é uma promessa. Para imprimir o valor, precisamos utilizar o método &lt;code&gt;then()&lt;/code&gt; que anexa &lt;em&gt;callbacks&lt;/em&gt; para a resolução:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mas um erro pode acontecer quando a promessa tentar resolver um valor:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;algo de errado ocorreu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A promessa está pendente, mas nada foi executado ao chamarmos &lt;code&gt;then(v =&amp;gt; console.log(v))&lt;/code&gt;. Isso acontece já que ela não foi resolvida por causa de um erro. Para sabermos qual erro ocorreu, precisamos passar outro &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; que será responsável por tratar falhas quando a promessa de um resultado for rejeitada, chamado &lt;code&gt;reject()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;algo de errado ocorreu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E após a chamada de &lt;code&gt;then()&lt;/code&gt;, que só será executado em caso de sucesso, chamamos o &lt;code&gt;catch()&lt;/code&gt; que será chamado em caso de erro:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;algo de errado ocorreu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// console.log(p);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;O estado da promessa será &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; e vai imprimir a mensagem de erro na execução do &lt;code&gt;catch()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promises são bastante úteis para chamadas assíncronas, quando precisamos saber sobre os estados de execuções futuras e tratar melhor as partes do código que dependam dessa execução. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora, vamos voltar ao nosso exemplo. Podemos utilizar &lt;code&gt;Promises&lt;/code&gt; para melhorar o código e fazer com que a pessoa que fez a chamada diga algo após a outra pessoa atender a chamada:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fazChamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu faço a chamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depoisDe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atendeu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;atendeu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;alô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a pessoa nao atendeu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fazChamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depoisDe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`a pessoa atende e diz &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu digo alguma informação&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#asyncawait"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Async/Await
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nosso código funciona e conseguimos representar uma chamada telefônica mais próxima da realidade. Porém, o código da função &lt;code&gt;ligacao()&lt;/code&gt; possui uma chamada encadeada de várias promessas - e poderia ser muito mais complexo do que isso, como muitas chamadas encadeadas de &lt;code&gt;then()&lt;/code&gt;. Dependendo da complexidade dessas chamadas, pode ser um código difícil de ler e entender. Um código síncrono é, na maioria dos casos, mais fácil de ler e entender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na especificação &lt;a href="https://262.ecma-international.org/8.0/"&gt;ES2017&lt;/a&gt; foram introduzidas duas novas expressões - &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; - que deixam o trabalho com &lt;code&gt;Promises&lt;/code&gt; mais confortável para o desenvolvedor. A expressão &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; é utilizada quando queremos criar funções assíncronas. Quando posicionada antes da declaração de uma função, quer dizer que essa função retorna um objeto do tipo &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaUm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaUm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaUm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Que vai gerar a saída:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Promise { 1 }
1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Portanto, ao utilizar a expressão &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; em uma função, seu retorno é embrulhado em um objeto &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;. Agora que entendemos como funciona o &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; vamos ver como o &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; funciona. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O uso do &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; somente é permitido em escopo de um função &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; - deste modo, a palavra-chave &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; além de embrulhar seu retorno em uma promessa, permite o uso do &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;. A palavra-chave &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; faz com que o JavaScript espere até que uma promessa seja resolvida (ou rejeitada) e retorne seu resultado.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaUm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaDois&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaUm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;retornaDois&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A função &lt;code&gt;retornaDois()&lt;/code&gt; faz uma pausa na primeira linha e segue sua execução quando a promessa &lt;code&gt;retonraUm()&lt;/code&gt; é resolvida. Portanto, espera a promessa ser finalizada. O mesmo acontece quando o valor é rejeitado:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;funcao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;um erro ocorreu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;funcao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E é similar a:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;funcao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;um erro ocorreu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;funcao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Como lança um erro, podemos fazer um tratamento com o bloco &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;funcao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;um erro ocorreu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;funcao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note que o código fica mais fácil de ler e raramente usamos as chamadas encadeadas de &lt;code&gt;then()&lt;/code&gt; e &lt;code&gt;catch()&lt;/code&gt;. Com a introdução de funções assíncronas com &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt;, a escrita de um código assíncrono fica parecido com a escrita de um código síncrono.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agora que aprendemos como funciona o &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt;, podemos refatorar nosso código para utilizar este recurso:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fazChamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;eu faço a chamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depoisDe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;atendeu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;atendeu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;alô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;a pessoa nao atendeu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;fazChamada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;depoisDe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;ligacao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Criando overlay com a previsão do tempo</title>
      <author>bug_elseif</author>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 01:19:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/bug_elseif/criando-overlay-com-a-previsao-do-tempo-5af</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/bug_elseif/criando-overlay-com-a-previsao-do-tempo-5af</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Após várias pessoas perguntarem se eu estava com frio durante as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bug_elseif"&gt;lives na Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, surgiu a ideia de colocar um overlay com a previsão do tempo, mostrando a temperatura atual da minha localização.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foi possível fazer isso de uma maneira simples, usando uma página HTML e uma API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#vamos-aos-passos"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Vamos aos passos:
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Primeiramente, criamos um arquivo com a estrutura básica de HTML:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"pt-br"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Titulo&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dentro do corpo do HTML, criamos uma tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; da seguinte forma:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://wttr.in/~Lages+Brazil_tqp0.png"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Desta maneira acessamos a API que nos retorna uma imagem &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt;, através do link vamos passar alguns parâmetros, são eles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Localização - informa o nome da cidade e país;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;t - aplica transparência na imagem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;q- retira o texto “previsão do tempo” deixando só o nome da cidade e país como título;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;p - adiciona uma borda ao redor da imagem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 - deixa visível somente o clima no momento atual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Além destes, existem &lt;a href="http://wttr.in/:help"&gt;outros parâmetros&lt;/a&gt; que modificam a imagem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Por fim adicionamos um &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag que atualizará a página em determinado tempo (em segundos):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"refresh"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"300"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A estrutura final do código fica assim:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;lang=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"pt-br"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;charset=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"UTF-8"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;http-equiv=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"refresh"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;content=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"300"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Previsão do tempo&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"http://wttr.in/~Lages+Brazil_tqp0.png"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>What is Agile – Demystifying “Agile”</title>
      <author>Najeeb Arif</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 23:31:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/najeebarif/what-is-agile-demystifying-agile-2b9o</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/najeebarif/what-is-agile-demystifying-agile-2b9o</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What comes to your mind when I say the word &lt;em&gt;“Agile”&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Software development Methodology. So, let’s say we treat it as a definition of &lt;em&gt;“Agile”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s golden period in life is their Schooling. Specifically, the 11th and 12th grade and I am no exception to that. So I am going to use a the “basis” of Mathematical Induction to proof the definition of “Agile”. Don’t worry, I won’t go into full blown mathematical induction proof and bore everyone around here. But for people who are not familiar with what Mathematical Induction is then here is a very layman definition for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is a mathematical proof technique and is used to mathematically prove a statement. Long story short, Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder, by proving that we can climb onto the bottom rung (the basis) and that from each rung we can climb onto the next one (the step).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering our “climbing the ladder” analogy, we should be able to first climb the bottom rung only then we will be able to climb higher. We can say that we must first establish that the base case holds true only then anything else will be possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that the definition of &lt;em&gt;“Agile”&lt;/em&gt; is a software development methodology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the actual dictionary meaning of “Agile”? (I usually tell my younger brother and sister that whenever you hear Buzz word in Computer Science, the first thing you should do is lookup the dictionary for its meaning) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Marked by ready ability to move with quick easy grace or able to move quickly and easily. Ex: an &lt;em&gt;agile&lt;/em&gt; dancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Having a quick resourceful and adaptable character. Ex: an &lt;em&gt;agile&lt;/em&gt; mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key words here are &lt;em&gt;move quickly and easily&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;adaptable or flexible&lt;/em&gt; so to speak. Now we can derive our own meaning of &lt;em&gt;“Agile”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;ability to move quickly and easily and also being adaptable or flexible at the same time&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on what do we mean by methodology:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A methodology is a body of methods, procedures and rules for a particular discipline&lt;/em&gt;. Set of steps are defined or dictated to be adhered to. – Not so flexible, true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look &lt;em&gt;“Agility”&lt;/em&gt; with our Software Development Hat on, we will realize that “Agility” &lt;em&gt;is the ability to continuously adapt and make improvements to the way we work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if “Agile” specified any methodology then, well it will be “Less Agile”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can clearly see our initial assumption falling apart. If our initial assumption turns out to be false then it means we can’t mathematically prove any statement. If you can not climb on the first rung then you cannot climb the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to our starting question &lt;em&gt;What is “Agile”?&lt;/em&gt; (if it is not a software development methodology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual definition of &lt;em&gt;“Agile”&lt;/em&gt; is found in the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Agile Manifesto”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The manifesto makes it clear that &lt;strong&gt;“Agile” is not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Specific way of developing software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Framework or Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agile is a set of Values and Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agile is really a collection of beliefs that teams can use in making decisions about how to do the work of developing the software&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we truly understand what “Agile” is, then we will learn that it is truly flexible. “Agile” does not make decisions of us but it gives us a foundation that teams can use to make decision that result in better software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge you to quickly skim through the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; and learn what values does it promise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html"&gt;12 principles&lt;/a&gt; behind the Agile Manifesto and they are also a good reading material. Trust me it will hardly take more than 5 mins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the values and principles of manifesto are very general and are less about telling us what to do, than they are about giving us the ability to make good decision in a particular situation. Agile values and principles explicitly avoid prescribing any methods and procedures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Agile is not a methodology but guidance on how to choose to methods and procedures that will work best for one’s team. Now if we consider the fact that if “Agile” specified methodology then it would have resulted in less agility. Less able to adapt to the specific circumstances of one’s team. So instead of giving us what should be done, “Agile” gave us “Values &amp;amp; Principles” which our teams can use to decide what we should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then next obvious question which comes to our mind is that if “Agile” is not a methodology then what are daily stand-ups, product demo, retrospective etc? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “Agile” is not a methodology, there are a number of methodologies which teams can use to follow agile principles and values. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCRUM&lt;/strong&gt;: specifies a number of specific ways for teams to work. This includes having daily stand-ups, fixed length sprints, product demos, retrospectives etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many teams find SCRUM as a very good way to follow “Agile” values and principles. It provides powerful methodology which assists in following “Agile”. But it is also important to know that just following these methodologies doesn’t makes a team “Agile”. They have to know that they are following these principles because it helps them align with the “Agile” values and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Programming (XP)&lt;/strong&gt;: is another methodology which includes number of practices like Test Driven Development, Pair Programming etc. The extreme programming methodology gives teams methods and processes that can be used to follow “Agile” values and principles. For example, Agile principle says that team should leverage change as a competitive advantage. XP practices give methods for writing software that enables it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team is truly trying to follow “Agile” principles and values, your methodology will evolve over time as your team grows and adapts. &lt;em&gt;After all, that is what it means to be “Agile”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="#hi-everyone"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  👋 Hi everyone!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to MongoDB $weeklyUpdate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, you'll find the latest developer tutorials, upcoming official MongoDB events, and get a heads up on our latest Twitch streams and podcast, curated by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdrienneTacke"&gt;Adrienne Tacke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#new-on-youtube"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  🎥 New on YouTube!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lots of new content to share with you! Take a look at our &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_m2976Yvbx-TyDLw7n1WA"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; to see the latest premieres from our Dev Rel team!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;MongoDB &amp;amp; Node.js: Aggregation &amp;amp; Data Analysis (Part 2 of 4)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to analyze data stored in MongoDB, you can use MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework to do so. In part two of this quick start tutorial for beginners, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lauren_schaefer"&gt;Lauren Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; provides a high-level overview of the aggregation framework and demonstrates how to use it in a Node.js script.  She explains how to use aggregate() to analyze data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Mapping SQL Terms and Concepts to MongoDB&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeKarlsson1"&gt;Joe Karlsson&lt;/a&gt; has another popular topic out! When you need to model data, is your first instinct to start breaking it down into rows and columns? It was for Joe, and many others too. When you want to develop apps in a modern, agile way, MongoDB databases can be the best option. In this video, we’ll compare and contrast the terms and concepts in SQL databases and MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I'm glad I chose Tech!</title>
      <author>Charity Parks</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 22:47:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/charityparks/why-i-m-glad-i-chose-tech-14kh</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/charityparks/why-i-m-glad-i-chose-tech-14kh</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone!  This is my first blog post here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been asked repeatedly why I chose to learn Software Engineering. I wasn't seeking out this particular journey per se, but I was in a rut. One day I was scrolling through Twitter and I saw a post about this opportunity to learn computer programming at the Flatiron School.  I could take the course online while still being able to work my 9-5 job. So I signed up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my journey with the Flatiron bootcamp, I began to see the world in a different way. There are so many parts of our lives that are enhanced through technology. For example, we no longer need a camera, video camera, library, tape recorder or even a television. We have cellphones that run on software programs that we use in place of those things! So many things are run by software. Vehicles, refrigerators, washer and dryers, traffic lights, thermostats and so much more are all run by software programs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have come to realize is that there is a great deal of opportunity in the technology field. Job opportunities are everywhere! For a lot of people this means an increase in pay allowing them new freedoms. Combining the tech field with other fields can be fun. You could have a tech job for an Art museum if you also have a love for the Arts, for example. Tech is everywhere!  Check out the Flatiron School and you can get started on an amazingly diverse new career! &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Laravel Service Classes Explained</title>
      <author>Farhan Hasin Chowdhury</author>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 22:40:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/fhsinchy/laravel-service-classes-explained-3m7p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/fhsinchy/laravel-service-classes-explained-3m7p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin once said —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A place for everything, everything in its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to software development as well. Understanding which portion of the code goes where is the key to a maintainable code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://laravel.com/"&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; being an elegant web framework, comes with a pretty organized &lt;a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/structure"&gt;directory structure&lt;/a&gt; by default but still I've seen a lot of people suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong. It's a no brainer that controllers go inside the &lt;code&gt;controllers&lt;/code&gt; directory, no confusions whatsoever. The thing people often confuse themselves with is, what to write in a controller and what not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#table-of-content"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Table of Content
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#project-codes"&gt;Project Codes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#the-scenario"&gt;The Scenario&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#understanding-business-logic"&gt;Understanding Business Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#service-classes-to-the-rescue"&gt;Service Classes to the Rescue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#action-re-usability"&gt;Action Re-usability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#project-codes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Project Codes
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find an implementation of the service discussed in this article in the following repository:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="ltag-github-readme-tag"&gt;
  &lt;div class="readme-overview"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--i3JOwpme--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev.to/assets/github-logo-ba8488d21cd8ee1fee097b8410db9deaa41d0ca30b004c0c63de0a479114156f.svg" alt="GitHub logo"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://github.com/fhsinchy/laravel-livewire-shopping-cart"&gt;
        laravel-livewire-shopping-cart
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      A real-time shopping cart powered by Laravel, Livewire and TailwindCSS
    &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apart from Laravel, the project makes use of &lt;a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/"&gt;Livewire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;TailwindCSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-scenario"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Scenario
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the following piece of code for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Http\Controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Http\Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CartItemController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'fail'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item not found'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Remove the specified resource from storage.
     *
     * @param  int  $id
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nf"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'success'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item removed from cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'fail'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item not found'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a controller from an imaginary e-commerce project, responsible for managing the shopping cart. Although this is a perfectly valid piece of code, there are some problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controller also knows too much. Look at the &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; method for example. It doesn't need to know whether the cart content comes from the session or database. Neither does it need to know how to calculate the total price of the cart items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A controller should be only responsible for transporting requests and responses. The inner details aka the business logic should be handled by other classes in the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#understanding-business-logic"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Understanding Business Logic
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in this &lt;a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/234251/what-really-is-the-business-logic"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business logic or domain logic is that part of the program which encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed. It prescribes how business objects interact with one another, and enforces the routes and the methods by which business objects are accessed and updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of a simple shopping cart system, the business logic behind adding an item to cart can be described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take necessary product information (id, name, price, quantity) as input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate the input data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Form a new cart item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if the item already exists in the cart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, update it's quantity and if no, add the newly formed item to cart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets have a look at the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Store a newly created resource in storage.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// validate the input data.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;validate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'required|string'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'price'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'required|numeric'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quantity'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'required|integer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// form a new cart item.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'price'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;floatval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quantity'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;intval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'options'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// check if the item already exists in the cart.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([]);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'id'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if yes, update it's quantity&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quantity'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quantity'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// if no, add the newly formed item to cart.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'content'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'success'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item added to cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the business logic translates to code pretty accurately. Now the problem is, controllers are not meant to contain business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#service-classes-to-the-rescue"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Service Classes to the Rescue
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the very popular &lt;a href="https://github.com/alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices/"&gt;alexeymezenin/laravel-best-practices&lt;/a&gt; repository:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zGOrxs7K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620657955936/1AfO4cLA6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zGOrxs7K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1620657955936/1AfO4cLA6.png" alt="Business logic should be in service class"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of service classes is not something built into the framework or documented in the official docs. As a result, different people refer to them differently. At the end of the day, service classes are plain classes responsible for holding the business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A service class for holding the shopping cart related business logic can be as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Support\Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Session\SessionManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CartService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;MINIMUM_QUANTITY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;DEFAULT_INSTANCE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'shopping-cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$instance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Constructs a new cart object.
     *
     * @param Illuminate\Session\SessionManager $session
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;SessionManager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;session&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Adds a new item to the cart.
     *
     * @param string $id

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;createCartItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MINIMUM_QUANTITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;MINIMUM_QUANTITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'price'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'quantity'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'options'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I've already said, service classes are not something built into the framework hence there is no &lt;code&gt;artisan make&lt;/code&gt; command for creating a service class. You keep the classes anywhere you like. I'm keeping my classes inside &lt;code&gt;App/Services&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CartService.php&lt;/code&gt; file contains both &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; methods. The public methods named &lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;remove()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;clear()&lt;/code&gt; are responsible for adding item to cart, removing item from cart, updating cart item quantity and clearing the cart respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other public methods are &lt;code&gt;content()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;total()&lt;/code&gt; responsible for returning the cart content and total price of added items respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the protected methods &lt;code&gt;getContent()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;createCartItem()&lt;/code&gt; are responsible for returning cart content within the class methods and forming a new cart item from the received parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the service class is ready, you need to use it inside the controller. To utilize the service class inside the &lt;code&gt;CartItemController.php&lt;/code&gt; file, the code needs to be updated as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Http\Controllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Http\Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Services\CartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Http\Requests\CartItemRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CartItemController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Instantiate a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;CartService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cartService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$total&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'cart.index'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'content'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'total'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$total&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Store a newly created resource in storage.
     *

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;CartItemRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'success'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item added to cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Display the specified resource.
     *
     * @param  int  $id

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Update the specified resource in storage.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request

     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'success'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item updated in cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Remove the specified resource from storage.
     *
     * @param  int  $id
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;destroy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'success'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'Item removed from cart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to zero configuration resolution, the service container resolves any class that doesn't depend on any interface automatically. Hence simply injecting the &lt;code&gt;CartService&lt;/code&gt; in the controller constructor does the trick:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CartItemController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Instantiate a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;__construct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;CartService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cartService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$cartService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now an instance of the &lt;code&gt;CartService&lt;/code&gt; class becomes available within the controller and can be accessed as &lt;code&gt;$this-&amp;gt;cartService&lt;/code&gt; property. Rest of the controller action have been updated to make use of the service and as you can see, the controller has become much cleaner now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#action-reusability"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Action Re-usability
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from making the controller cleaner, you also get the benefit of the shopping cart related actions being accessible from anywhere. Consider the following livewire component for example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;App\Http\Livewire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;App\Facades\Cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Livewire\Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Illuminate\Contracts\View\View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ProductComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Mounts the component on the template.
     *
     * @return void
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Renders the component on the browser.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Contracts\View\View
     */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'livewire.product'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="cd"&gt;/**
     * Adds an item to cart.
     *

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;addToCart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Cart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unit_price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quantity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;emit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'productAddedToCart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can add, remove, update or clear the shopping cart from anywhere. Prior to the service class implementation, the only way to manage the cart was through HTTP requests. Now you can even manage the cart through &lt;code&gt;artisan&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of service classes discussed in this article is nothing concrete and I'm not claiming it to be a silver bullet. It's something that I've used in the past and have had no problem whatsoever. If you want to look at some other approach, consider reading about action classes &lt;a href="https://freek.dev/1371-refactoring-to-actions/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
