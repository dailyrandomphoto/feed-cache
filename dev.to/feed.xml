  5 things that are ruining your blogs &amp;amp; how to fix 'em! 😱
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello folks and welcome back! 👋🏻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I'd like to share with you 5 things that I wholeheartedly believe are ruining your blogs. Now, I've only been actively blogging for a month now (more info &lt;a href="https://dev.to/technoglot/reflecting-on-my-1st-month-blogging-a-retrospect-1c6k"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but I've also been reading a TON. So despite not being a blogging guru, here's some advice I can share to help you make your blogs better. I hope you find them helpful! 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckle up and enjoy the ride! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#poor-visual-structure"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Poor visual structure 🤢
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gee, have you heard of headings? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s8qrGgIh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia1.tenor.com%252Fimages%252Ffe250a86e1dfa2648481e7da5ebd441b%252Ftenor.gif%253Fitemid%253D5510026%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--s8qrGgIh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia1.tenor.com%252Fimages%252Ffe250a86e1dfa2648481e7da5ebd441b%252Ftenor.gif%253Fitemid%253D5510026%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="you gon learn today"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen too many blogs that have ZERO headings in them whatsoever. Sorry to break it to you my dearest, but a blog without any clear visual structure is just an eyesore. 😓&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PnBuyTOD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia.giphy.com%252Fmedia%252Fl0HeiaW8q9B6tqoHS%252Fsource.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PnBuyTOD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia.giphy.com%252Fmedia%252Fl0HeiaW8q9B6tqoHS%252Fsource.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="mic drop"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way: how can you solve this? Easy. When drafting your blog, try to think in terms of headings. Each heading being a section of your blog. Once you have your blog title and section headings written down, you can proceed to fill in the blanks. In other words: write the actual content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not convinced yet? How about a mini step-by-step guide? 🤔 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 1️⃣&lt;/strong&gt;: Write down your blog title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 2️⃣&lt;/strong&gt;: Write down your section headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Step 3️⃣&lt;/strong&gt;: Write the actual content of your blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, here's a structure you can use in all your blogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Short intro&lt;/strong&gt; (between 3 and 5 sentences long)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Body of your blog&lt;/strong&gt; (typically having several sections, each with corresponding paragraphs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; (no longer than 3 sentences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! There's more. Keep on reading! 👇🏻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: This blog is something I'd consider properly structured. Not because I wrote it, but because it has a clear structure. Take notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#huge-blocks-of-text"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  HUGE blocks of text 😵
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just who are you trying to kill of boredom, huh? How dare you not break that huge piece of text into smaller paragraphs?! Seriously, you have offended my eyes and brain! 😡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, like I said in the previous point: &lt;strong&gt;structure matters&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding headings is important, but so is creating paragraphs. Additionally, spacing out your content makes it more visually pleasant for your audience. Please don't lump together all the content in a single section. As a rule of thumb: keep paragraphs between 3 and 5 sentences long. Longer than that will probably make it a dissertation. Or a best-selling novel (if you're lucky) 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO tip 💡&lt;/strong&gt;: Always preview your content before publishing it. If you can get a friend or two to proofread your blog and give feedback, that's awesome too! If you feel some parts of your blog are too bulky, just go back in there and: Break 👏🏻 It 👏🏻 Up 👏🏻.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-dont-engage"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You don't engage 😒
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly, I don't understand this behavior. I've seen some excellent pieces and discussions around here. Yet despite all the comments and reactions, the author does not engage with their readers. WHY?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yPS1nqtA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fmtv.com%252Fnews%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252Fstyle%252F2014%252F05%252Fi-want-it-that-way-8.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yPS1nqtA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fmtv.com%252Fnews%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252Fstyle%252F2014%252F05%252Fi-want-it-that-way-8.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="tell me why, backstreet boys"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, yeah...moving on! 😂 Engage with your audience. PLEASE! 🥺 I cannot for the life of me stress this enough. ENGAGE! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone commented on your post? Drop a like on their comment. Drop a &lt;strong&gt;"Thank you so much for reading!"&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;"So happy you enjoyed it!"&lt;/strong&gt; as a reply to their comment. Yeah, yeah, I hear you loud and clear: &lt;strong&gt;"I'm too busy for that 🧐"&lt;/strong&gt;. If you happen to be a busy fella, just put aside 10 minutes in your schedule. Use these 10 precious minutes to engage with your audience, reply to their comments or answer their burning questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a time when I'd say it's okay to un-engage. For instance, let's say you posted a blog 2 or 3 weeks ago. Till this day, you still get notifications from people reacting to that blog post or commenting on it. Do you still have to reply to those comments? The answer: if you want to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I typically still get back at comments after so long, but if I feel really lazy, I'll just drop a like on their comment. That's so they know that I saw their comment and enjoyed reading it. Quite frankly, don't expect me to remember every last word I wrote in a 3-week-old blog post. Sometimes I don't even know what people are getting at when commenting on such an old post of mine! 😜&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO tip 💡&lt;/strong&gt;: Genuinely engage with other people's content too, not just yours. It is more important than you think! 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#you-dont-switch-it-up"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  You don't switch it up 🥱
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u8GYfKYV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia1.tenor.com%252Fimages%252F5ff1d9c792b57b09f612653b5d7ee511%252Ftenor.gif%253Fitemid%253D8449267%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u8GYfKYV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia1.tenor.com%252Fimages%252F5ff1d9c792b57b09f612653b5d7ee511%252Ftenor.gif%253Fitemid%253D8449267%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="sleepy boss baby"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this I mean that ALL your blogs follow the same format. You literally have abused the listicle blog post format! Or perhaps you only write about the same topic all the darn time. Now, allow me to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, there is nothing wrong with listicles (that was an example by the way. No need to get booty-tickled). What is semi-wrong however, is feeding your audience the EXACT SAME blog post format over and over and over again. Sure, it makes for a consistent blogging style, but it may get boring and monotonous to your readers in the long-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, writing about the same topic is not a sin! You found a niche? Exploit it by all means! I'm no one to stop you. But, please dare to venture into unexplored waters. Maybe write a TIL (Today I Learned) blog post for a change. Or tell us a funny anecdote. Whatever it is, switch it up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the drawing board you go! ✍🏻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#lack-of-media"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Lack of media 📎
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this I don't mean that you need to add 3000 GIFs in a single blog post. What I mean is that your post feels &lt;strong&gt;bare&lt;/strong&gt;. There's no diagrams, no pictures, no GIFs, no embedded videos. NOTHING. It's just TEXT. All TEXT! BLOCKS and BLOCKS of TEXT! (Can you tell how traumatized I truly am? 😢)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me make this clear. Code snippets don't count. That's text too! 😂 But seriously, it does not hurt to add an image to your blog. Or to embed a tweet or video you found helpful and that relates to the topic you're writing about. Remember how I told you earlier that you should mind your blog structure and should break up large chunks of text? Well, media helps you with this! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reader it is pleasant to stumble upon an image or two when reading. It gives the brain something different to process other than just text. (I'm not a neuroscientist, but I bet our brains are not wired to love large chunks of text anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️) So please give it a go in your next blog post. Add some media to it and rejoice! ✨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bonus-extremely-lengthy-posts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  BONUS 🎉: Extremely lengthy posts
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be honest, would you read your 30 minute long blog post? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uNMCp8Ad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia1.tenor.com%252Fimages%252Ff871b811dd577d2650009194a9a4206e%252Ftenor.gif%253Fitemid%253D10312303%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uNMCp8Ad--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia1.tenor.com%252Fimages%252Ff871b811dd577d2650009194a9a4206e%252Ftenor.gif%253Fitemid%253D10312303%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="absolutely fucking not"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse the language! 🤭 What was I saying? Oh yeah! If your answer to the above question was NOPE or along those lines, then what makes you think that your audience will read such a long blog? I personally would read a 30 minute read only if I am in the depths of my despair and have literally tried EVERYTHING suggested on SO (Stack Overflow), without any luck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you admit defeat... Good. But what now? Allow me to introduce you to the innovative thing that is SERIES! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7fXRwLv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia.giphy.com%252Fmedia%252FxT77XWum9yH7zNkFW0%252Fgiphy.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7fXRwLv1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmedia.giphy.com%252Fmedia%252FxT77XWum9yH7zNkFW0%252Fgiphy.gif%26f%3D1%26nofb%3D1" alt="WOW"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, let's be real. It's a simple, yet overlooked thing. You got a 15 minute read? How about you turn that into a 3 part series, with each part being a 5-minute read? Sounds great, right? However, there's one little gotcha that I have noticed when writing series myself. The later parts got less attention than the first part. Though I must admit I lack the sufficient scientific proof to back up this statement. (I've only written like 3 series so far. Or was it 4? Meh, I forgot! 😜)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you find yourself writing a 60 minute read, how about you:&lt;br&gt;
a) make it a series of blogs, or &lt;br&gt;
b) make it an in-depth guide (e-book) that you can sell online for a few bucks? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can thank me later! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#cest-fini"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  C'est fini! 🏁
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray! You made it to the end of this one! How about a medal? 🏅 Now, tell me, how did you like my first listicle EVER? Let me know in the comments! 👇🏻 Guess who engages with her readers? 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JRq3862C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://media.tenor.co/images/ee92bb8ecce631180e17eb097823c836/raw" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JRq3862C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://media.tenor.co/images/ee92bb8ecce631180e17eb097823c836/raw" alt="ME!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, thanks for reading! 🙇🏻‍♀️ Now go make those blog posts sexy!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;May the code always be with you... 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻 See you next time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Save hundreds of dollars on courses as a university student</title>
      <author>Albert Hadacek</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 10:14:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/albert_hadacek/save-hundreds-of-dollars-on-courses-as-a-university-student-5g7g</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/albert_hadacek/save-hundreds-of-dollars-on-courses-as-a-university-student-5g7g</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are studying at a university, you might have access to many resources for free that others have to pay for. It is a great opportunity to gain some edge, learn tools that are highly in demand while not spending any money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest package, you can access as a student is the &lt;a href="https://education.github.com/pack"&gt;Github Student Developer Package&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an academic email address Github recognizes, access is granted immediately. Besides great deals on learning platforms, you also get a bunch of other great deals. So, check that out! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not even matter if you are enrolled in a Computer Science program, any student can take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#frontend-masters"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Frontend Masters
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best deal in the GitHub student package is definitely &lt;strong&gt;6 months&lt;/strong&gt; of free access to &lt;strong&gt;Frontend Masters&lt;/strong&gt;. It is worth between &lt;strong&gt;200-250 USD&lt;/strong&gt; and the content there is just awesome. If you wanna step up your web development skills, this is the platform you should use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#data-camp"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Data Camp
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are more interested in the world of data, you can get &lt;strong&gt;3 months&lt;/strong&gt; access to Data Camp. There you can learn Python, SQL, or R and really get a good grasp of advanced concepts. This content is worth &lt;strong&gt;75 USD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#educativeio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Educative.io
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great platform with several famous courses that might help you land a dream job. Their System Design course is highly popular and you can get &lt;strong&gt;3 months&lt;/strong&gt; for free worth over &lt;strong&gt;100 USD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#oreilly"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  O'Reilly
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is university-specific, but my university offers full access to the O'Reilly online platform which contains thousands of books and video courses, including some courses from Udemy. Again, it is a great place to learn and it saves you &lt;strong&gt;499 USD a year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#your-online-university-library"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Your Online University Library
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, check your online university library, you might get great books and articles from there for free. These days, programming books cost between &lt;strong&gt;30 - 50 USD&lt;/strong&gt; and this is a legal way to get them for free.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4 lessons I learned as a starting Scrum master</title>
      <author>Jelle Smeets</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:32:40 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/4-lessons-i-learned-as-a-starting-scrum-master-2p02</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/smeetsmeister/4-lessons-i-learned-as-a-starting-scrum-master-2p02</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw that I passed my 4 year mark as a certified Scrum master. This seemed a good moment for me to reflect on my experiences so far, and take a closer look at the lessons I learned as a starting Scrum master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a little bit of context, I started as a part time Scrum master, part time developer at the company I currently work at. During the last 4 years a lot has changed, in terms of my own personal development, how the company handles agile and scrum and the teams I was scrum master for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following lessons learned as a Scrum master are what stuck to me as the most important lessons, or the most "aha" moments I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e8lScnAI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fihj3qrlw9jdhzvqfseu.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--e8lScnAI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fihj3qrlw9jdhzvqfseu.jpeg" alt="Lessons learned as a starting scrum master"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conflicts-are-not-always-bad"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conflicts are not always bad
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first team I was a Scrum master in, there where several conflicts. Without the experience I have now, I saw those conflicts as an impediment to immediately solve. If the team is not fighting about code standards, which libraries to pick or at what time the daily should be, they could be doing actual work. On my two day training for CSM1, the trainer talked about how conflicts are part of the development process as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my nature is being a peace keeper, but when I resolved conflicts before they really started, I took away the chance of the team to overcome them, learn from them and become closer as a team. This resulted in the team continuing to work as individuals, and never got close enough to really get into a mode where they could collaborate, without me as an conflict solver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, not all conflicts should be played out fully. some conflicts can be more harmful than the lesson they learn. You can compare it to being a parent (or so have I been told). Sure you want your children to learn from their mistakes. Letting young children go outside without their jacket, is something they can learn from. But you will not let them cross a busy road, on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#am-i-a-scrum-master-or-a-developer-with-extras"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Am I a Scrum master or a developer with extras?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the professionals around me at the time that where Scrum master where basically just senior developers with a bit more responsibility, especially with the part time roles of both Scrum master and developer. This lead me to believe that the role of a Scrum master was the "frontrunner of the team". You should prepare all tickets technically, make sure the Scrum artefacts and ceremonies are done and will be held responsible if the team is not running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first times I started realizing I was just a senior developer with some extras, was during my Scrum master certification. But the truth is, my big "&lt;em&gt;aha&lt;/em&gt;" moment came when I read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Agile-Teams-ScrumMasters-Addison-Wesley-dp-0321637704/dp/0321637704/"&gt;Coaching Agile Teams by Lyssa Adkins&lt;/a&gt;. This lead me to re-evaluate how I saw my own position. As the biggest changes, let the development team really be in charge of the development part, so the ownership and feeling of commitment will grow. And focus more on other areas, for example making the whole organisation more agile, shifting my style from leading to coaching or giving workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#adapt-your-style-to-the-phase-your-team-is-in"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Adapt your style to the phase your team is in
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I was asked to become a Scrum master for a new team to be formed, I was a developer in a team that was in my eyes, really close to being a performing team. Years later I still feel like those where "the good old days" when I look back on being able to deliver value fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team consisted of some very experienced developers, and found a mode of working which worked for them. The Scrum master at that moment could do a more loosely role, as the team was responsible enough to make sure we kept running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment when I switched to a new started team, I tried to copy what I saw from my Scrum master in the previous team. But that did not work as well. Who could have thought that the more loosely style would work for experienced developers with experience in Agile, and working together for 2 years, but did not work for a group of developers that have not worked together before, and have not worked with Agile either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development"&gt;Tuckman stages of group development&lt;/a&gt; describes that there are 4 different stages for teams, that all require a different style of coaching. As a Scrum master in a Forming or Storming team, the style of a more strict Scrum master is will benefit the team more, while a Norming or Performing team can benefit from a more loose role,.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#being-a-part-time-developer-does-not-work"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Being a part time developer does not work
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can be quite honest splitting up your time between a developer and a Scrum master does not work. If you truly feel that improving Agile and the team, or even your organisation is important, it will take all your time. The pitfall with being a developer on the side is, that I noticed that instead of doing gemba walks, listening to customers or experimenting with new approaches I coded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results into Scrum masters doing the bare minimum, to make sure they don't lose any time that they could deliver features. While the true power of the Scrum master lies in getting the organization on board, making the team more empowered and look out for continuous improvements. And the trade-off to me was; Do I want to put minimal effort into the growth of the team to make sure I can develop 5 story points per sprint? &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; do I want to make sure that because of my full commitment as a Scrum master, the team can do 5 extra points (and even more) without my input as a developer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If after all of this you still have the feeling that the Scrum master position is not full time, I advice you to read this post: &lt;a href="http://agiletrail.com/2011/11/14/42-tasks-for-a-scrum-masters-job/"&gt;42 Tasks for a Scrum masters job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scrum master role I saw when starting is quite a lot different from how I fulfil that role now. I would say my perspective has changed for the better, and all of these lessons learned as a Scrum master help me become a little bit better every day. The most important lessons for me where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't try to prevent all conflicts, let the team learn from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a good look at your own position. Don't only follow the examples you have at work, but also look at outside sources how they fill the position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no 1 solution that will fit all teams, adapt your style to the phase the team is in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a Scrum master full time, you will be amazed at what you can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>React.JS in a Nutshell</title>
      <author>Rithik Samanthula</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:15:26 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/code2rithik/react-js-in-a-nutshell-4k65</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;React, A JavaScript Library for Building Beautiful User Interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was developed by Facebook and was released in the year of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReactJS has been one of the most influential libraries of recent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use it to build components that represent logical and reusable parts of the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lZaz5-In--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vr3tfiyb9k6fvkcnqumh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lZaz5-In--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vr3tfiyb9k6fvkcnqumh.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of React is the simplicity of creating a component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GAX6U-yI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8k5ym5830gor7l0nns6.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GAX6U-yI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r8k5ym5830gor7l0nns6.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use JavaScript Functions with HTML Code inside it to render the components. This is known as JSX. It compiles HTML and JavaScript together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1h4L8iSp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x18tib8olixx2suc1oh8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1h4L8iSp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x18tib8olixx2suc1oh8.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, you can easily jump into React Native and start building mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EfK4-CHF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bu58ucqyvt6zsik2od8o.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EfK4-CHF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bu58ucqyvt6zsik2od8o.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise that this UI Library is one of the in-demand skills for many developers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3QrCoJ9B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7pxtveqi70on8c2w7g7i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3QrCoJ9B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7pxtveqi70on8c2w7g7i.png" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Ways To Make Money With Your Code</title>
      <author>Krushil Koshti</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us know what “Coding” is and maybe some of you’ve built really cool projects and have many years of practice, however, not everybody knows how to really make money from your code. I tried to find the best ways how to do it, some of them I used myself and some of them not, but actually, everybody can highlight something from this top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freelancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancing is one of the most popular ways of doing money, if you know something well enough (Coding, Photoshoping, or Editing) then you can easily present your services. It is directly proportional to how much effort you put into this. There are many platforms to start accepting orders from other people, for instance: Upwork, Fiverr and etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>🌍📍 Building an Interactive Dot Density Map in JS</title>
      <author>andreykh1985</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/andreykh1985/building-an-interactive-dot-density-map-in-js-1jn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dot density maps may seem to be difficult to build, especially for those taking their very first steps in interactive data visualization development. But the truth is, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shachee Swadia, a data designer and storyteller, made a compelling tutorial showing how to create a beautiful interactive JavaScript-based dot map in four steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the process, in the article, she is visualizing data about all shipping ports across the world, first making a basic map in just a few lines of code and then improving it in several more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="https://www.anychart.com/blog/2021/04/20/js-dot-density-map/"&gt;JS dot map tutorial&lt;/a&gt; 🔥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚢⚓️🌐&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The unconventional Developer Advocate?</title>
      <author>Vanessa Measom</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:58:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/measomvanessa/the-unconventional-developer-advocate-21gi</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/measomvanessa/the-unconventional-developer-advocate-21gi</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading Wassim Chegham's article &lt;a href="https://dev.to/wassimchegham/the-subtle-art-of-being-a-developer-advocate-gdg"&gt;"The Subtle Art of Being A Developer Advocate"&lt;/a&gt; and it got me thinking of my role as a Developer Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the title "The unconventional Developer Advocate"? Well for me, I'm not actually a developer and Wassim mentioned that &lt;em&gt;"... Developer Advocates are, before anything else, developers themselves and speak the same language as other developers."&lt;/em&gt;. So where do I stand in the Developer Advocacy world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wassim states in his article &lt;em&gt;""Advocacy" is an old concept that comes from the Medieval Latin word "advocare" which means "to add a voice". The term "advocate" comes from Old French word "avocat" which means "a lawyer". So, an Advocate literarily means someone who "pleads a case or a cause", who "argues that something needs to be changed or improved"."&lt;/em&gt; and despite possibly being at a disadvantage of not being a developer, I feel that I can at least be an advocate for the developers in our own community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who do I work for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I've been working at &lt;a href="https://www.slashdata.co/"&gt;SlashData&lt;/a&gt;, (formerly known as VisionMobile), for 13 years. SlashData help top 100 technology firms understand software developer audiences and measure the ROI of their developer strategies I joined when the company was relatively small, and in a startup environment, over the years I have taken many roles from marketing to finance and HR ops, finally finding the place that fits best with me, working in the developer facing part of the company - &lt;a href="https://developereconomics.com/"&gt;Developer Economics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's my role at Developer Economics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My day to day tasks differs depending on the time of the year, you see, we run two developer surveys per year (they typically attract over 20,000+ developers) and there are a few parts of the survey process that I'm heavily involved in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is by far the most important part of my role. During surveys we receive &lt;a href="https://developereconomics.com/blog/what-did-developers-have-to-say-about-our-q2-2020-survey"&gt;thousands of comments&lt;/a&gt; from participants with suggestions on how we can improve, tools we should include, translation feedback, prizes we should offer and more. Along with others in our team, we review every single piece of feedback and reply to all personally. We also reach out to community members outside the survey to check how we can improve our community offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Committee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We have a lovely bunch of developers who are part of our Developer Committee. They are members of our community and help us to review our prizes, and content test our surveys before they go live to the wider audience. My job is to ensure their input is relayed to the analysts and developers at SlashData who build our developer surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the past four years I've run our biweekly &lt;a href="https://content.developereconomics.com/developer-economics-newsletter-signup-form"&gt;developer newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. As I mentioned above, I'm not a developer, but over the years I've come to understand the news and resources developers want to see. I've recently started to include wellbeing tips, especially with the last year taking it's toll on people's wellbeing. We recently ran a feedback poll about the content, people really responded well to it. We also polled our community and in one of our questions, we asked what they like the best, among the open-ended answers there were quite a few responses with just "Vanessa" 🤩, because I sign all the emails they receive from us and deal with day to day queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not for recruitment, we have over 30,000 members in our community, and over 1k have been with the community for over 5 years, so I run interviews to get to know them on a personal level, to understand what issues they experience, their goals, what tools they use etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer prizes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We love to include prizes in our surveys that are going to make developers lives better. I'm responsible for choosing the prizes that will be included in the survey, from laptops, phones, license, vouchers, courses and swag. Not only do I choose the prizes, I also run the prize draws during and after the surveys have closed, contact the winners, order and ship their prizes and deal with many communications to ensure those who we can't get a physical prize to, can get a cash alternative - sadly for some countries there's many hoops to jump through to ensure the devs get their prizes. Developers from 155 countries take our surveys, and I advocate for everyone to get equally valuable prizes, no matter where in the world they might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey translations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our surveys are available in English plus 8 additional languages (Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Spanish, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Russian, Japanese, Korean). I don't personally translate the surveys, but I do work closely with our translation partner to ensure our surveys are translated into the native languages so we can reach a &lt;a href="https://www.slashdata.co/blog/developer-research-101-right-methodology-reliable-survey-data?"&gt;diverse&lt;/a&gt; audience of developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There's a lot of customer service involved in the role, responding to developer queries throughout the year, we don't have a product that we sell, but I deal with prize queries following our prize draws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with our Community Lead &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiljanaMitic6"&gt;Miljana&lt;/a&gt; to ensure we grow our community, look for partners who we can work with, gifts we can offer to our newsletter subscribers, manage our CRM, add blog posts and other content to our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who am I as a person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm a mum of two, based in the UK, I'm actually quite an introvert so this is quite scary putting my head above the sand writing this! In one of my recent side quests I trained as a Health Kinesiologist (this side of me is where I love to help with developers wellbeing), next step is Reiki. At this stage of my life I'm usually found running after the kids at the park, sometimes I go cycling, love Minecrafting, I meditate when I can remember / have time. I want to learn to play the Piano.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I'm obviously not a developer but I feel I make up for it with my primary role, which is giving a voice to developers in our community, I celebrate the individuals, champion their projects and try to empower them by finding news and resources to make them a better developer (and look out for their wellbeing!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're one of the Developer Economics community members, say hi 👋 in the comments, or you can connect with me on Twitter at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MeasomVanessa"&gt;@MeasomVanessa&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a series of Leetcode solution explanations (&lt;a href="https://dev.to/seanpgallivan/leetcode-solutions-index-57fl"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt;). If you liked this solution or found it useful,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;please like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;this post and/or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;upvote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/brick-wall/discuss/1170889"&gt;my solution post on Leetcode's forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Jump to&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="#idea"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solution Idea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; || &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="#javascript-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#python-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#java-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#c-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;C++&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the &lt;strong&gt;top&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;bottom&lt;/strong&gt; and cross the &lt;strong&gt;least&lt;/strong&gt; bricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;a href="#constraints"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constraints:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed &lt;code&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of bricks in each row is in range &lt;code&gt;[1,10,000]&lt;/code&gt;. The height of wall is in range &lt;code&gt;[1,10,000]&lt;/code&gt;. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed &lt;code&gt;20,000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#idea"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idea:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Jump to&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="#description"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem Description&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; || &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="#javascript-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#python-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#java-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="#c-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;C++&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the goal here is to find where a line will cross the fewest bricks, then we could also say that the goal is to find where the most brick edges line up. We can consider the edges to occur at an index representing the current running total of the previous elements of a given row of the wall. For example, if the row is defined as &lt;strong&gt;[1,2,2,1]&lt;/strong&gt;, then the inside edges occur at &lt;strong&gt;[1,1+2,1+2+2]&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;[1,3,5]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we now know how to find the edges, then we're left with finding out which index has the highest frequency of edges, which naturally calls for a &lt;strong&gt;frequency map.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can iterate through each &lt;strong&gt;row&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;wall&lt;/strong&gt;, keep a running total of the current row (&lt;strong&gt;rowSum&lt;/strong&gt;), and then update the frequency of each edge's index in our frequency map (&lt;strong&gt;freq&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we're done filling &lt;strong&gt;freq&lt;/strong&gt;, we just need to iterate through it to find the highest value (&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;), which represents the number of edges aligned on a single index. Our actual answer, however, is the number of bricks, not edges, so we should &lt;strong&gt;return&lt;/strong&gt; the total number of rows minus &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Javascript, it's more performant to iterate through the finished &lt;strong&gt;freq&lt;/strong&gt; looking for the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Python it's easier to run &lt;strong&gt;max()&lt;/strong&gt; directly on &lt;strong&gt;freq&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Java and C++ it's faster to keep track of &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; as we add values to &lt;strong&gt;freq&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Java, it's also weirdly more performant to extract the &lt;strong&gt;row&lt;/strong&gt; processing to a helper function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Material Tailwind – New Framework for Web Developers</title>
      <author>Sajad Ahmad Nawabi</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:15:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/sajadevo/material-tailwind-new-framework-for-web-developers-1pjd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/sajadevo/material-tailwind-new-framework-for-web-developers-1pjd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When talking about the user interface, the most important thing is its appearance. It is the interaction point with the user’s attention. However, building a beautiful and effective appearance is not easy because it needs spending time and a lot of skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the good part is that there are some workarounds, like frameworks and libraries (e.g. &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt;), which facilitate the process of building user interfaces (but not that much like you’re thinking about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, are you looking for a simple, easy, and quick way to build a better and beautiful user interface? If the answer is YES then you should take a look over &lt;a href="https://material-tailwind.com"&gt;Material Tailwind&lt;/a&gt;. Read this article to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-material-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Material Tailwind?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://material-tailwind.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material Tailwind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a framework for building user interfaces, an open-source project by &lt;a href="https://creative-tim.com"&gt;Creative Tim&lt;/a&gt;. It is using &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt; – a utility-first CSS framework, and &lt;a href="https://material.io"&gt;Material Design 2&lt;/a&gt; guidelines – a modern design system developed by Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HIKigIxF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/material-tailwind-logo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HIKigIxF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/material-tailwind-logo.png" alt="Material Tailwind"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first version of &lt;a href="https://material-tailwind.com"&gt;Material Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; has been released based on &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before we deep dive into Material Tailwind’s details, let’s take a look at &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://material.io"&gt;Material Design 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-tailwind-css"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Tailwind CSS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt; is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design directly into your markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to other CSS frameworks like &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t come with predefined components; instead, Tailwind CSS provides you a set of CSS helper classes. Using these classes, you can create custom designs and user interfaces with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Tailwind CSS, you can check the Tailwind CSS website: &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;https://tailwindcss.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-material-design-2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Material Design 2?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://material.io"&gt;Material Design 2&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular, modern, and comprehensive design system developed by Google that helps you build high-quality digital experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design system itself is a comprehensive set of useful guides and helpful tools that developers or designers can use for building modern, trendy and user-friendly user interfaces that adhere to material style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Material Design 2, you can check the Material Design 2 website: &lt;a href="https://material.io/"&gt;https://material.io/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-reactjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is ReactJS?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the application’s view layer in Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about ReactJS, you can check the ReactJS website: &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;https://reactjs.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-material-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why Material Tailwind?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as you read above, &lt;a href="https://material-tailwind.com"&gt;Material Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; has been built using the most popular technologies and trends around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, building a user interface is not easy, even if you’re using Tailwind CSS. It comes up with different helper classes, and you need to play around with thousands of helper classes to build a simple user interface that makes your code cluttered. Also, add the fact that you need to build everything from scratch, which takes a lot of time. ☹️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using Material Tailwind you can build a user interface as quickly and easily as possible because you don’t need to build everything from scratch or play around with Tailwind CSS helper classes. Material Tailwind provides you all the important and necessary components for building a user interface in the format of &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;ReactJS&lt;/a&gt; components with the space of &lt;a href="https://material.io"&gt;Material Design 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com"&gt;Tailwind CSS&lt;/a&gt; helper classes 😍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#who-can-use-material-tailwind"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Who can use Material Tailwind?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Material Tailwind is a free and open-source project and everyone can use it, you only need to have a basic knowledge of ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#material-tailwind-components"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Material Tailwind Components
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, Material Tailwind contains all the necessary and important components for building a user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buttons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x3LSP2hL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/profil-page-1024x582.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x3LSP2hL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://creativetimblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/profil-page-1024x582.png" alt="templates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not the end of the story and we will expand and add more components to Material Tailwind in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#material-tailwind-is-opensource"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Material Tailwind is open-source
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Material Tailwind is an open-source project, and everyone can contribute to making Material Tailwind better. You can contribute to solve different issues or expand its components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Before contributing to Material Tailwind, please read the contributing guideline: &lt;a href="https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-tailwind/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-tailwind/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-the-near-future"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In the near future
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, the first version of Material Tailwind is only available for ReactJS, but soon, you will see the other versions for &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org"&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://angularjs.org"&gt;Angular.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://svelte.dev"&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"&gt;Vanilla Javascript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New VSCode extension that takes automation to the next level</title>
      <author>Elio Struyf</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:14:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/estruyf/new-vscode-extension-that-take-automation-to-the-next-level-3mcd</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/estruyf/new-vscode-extension-that-take-automation-to-the-next-level-3mcd</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I switched from using Alfred over to &lt;a href="https://raycast.com/"&gt;Raycast&lt;/a&gt;. What convinced me of Raycast is the simplicity the tool provides, plus the ability to simply create your custom commands/scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Info&lt;/strong&gt;: I already wrote about it: &lt;a href="https://dev.to/estruyf/devhack-using-raycast-to-speed-up-my-productivity-1h4k"&gt;Using Raycast to speed up my productivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I use Raycast, the more I want to automate. A script I created was to start up my daily development tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open my VSCode editor with the right project loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open my terminal to the right folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/code&gt; to the Azure Portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/code&gt; with my application URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tasks typically do not take a lot of time, but automating this by one command is so easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#taking-it-to-the-next-level"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Taking it to the next level
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take it to the next level, I wanted to start my commands in VSCode as well. For my project I use two terminals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; as my application needs to be accessible remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the local development server (Next.js in my case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can only trigger certain actions in VSCode by shortcuts. That is why I thought to create a new VSCode &lt;code&gt;Remote Control&lt;/code&gt; extension which allows you to send commands from anywhere on your device to the running VSCode instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Info&lt;/strong&gt;: Check out the extension here: &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-remote-control"&gt;VSCode Remote Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extension spins up a &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt; server. By default, it will start it on port: &lt;code&gt;3710&lt;/code&gt;, but is configurable from the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#show-me-what-it-can-do"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Show me what it can do
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speed up my process, I wanted to open two terminal instances in VSCode and run my commands in each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my Raycast script, all I had to do is add the following code:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;workbench.action.terminal.newWithCwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; }"&lt;/span&gt; | websocat ws://localhost:3710
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: { &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;npm run ngrok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; } }"&lt;/span&gt; | websocat ws://localhost:3710
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;workbench.action.terminal.split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; }"&lt;/span&gt; | websocat ws://localhost:3710
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;workbench.action.terminal.focusAtIndex2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; }"&lt;/span&gt; | websocat ws://localhost:3710
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: { &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;cd solutions/msteams/webapp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm run dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; } }"&lt;/span&gt; | websocat ws://localhost:3710
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: this is not only created for Raycast. Once installed, you can run commands from anywhere on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the result of this script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ImWOc5Y7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kh8wmqiqqyic2fdkpjy8.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ImWOc5Y7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kh8wmqiqqyic2fdkpjy8.gif" alt="The result of the script"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Right in my dev shoes</title>
      <author>Marvin</author>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:10:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mfrachet/right-in-my-dev-shoes-24og</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mfrachet/right-in-my-dev-shoes-24og</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working in the web industry is like a gift and a curse to me. On one side, I'm increasing my situation and making money doing something that I love and on the other side, I'm seeing an increasing amount of things that I don't agree with but that becomes quite the norm — and it feels bad to be part of that without doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-am-i-feeling-that-way"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why am I feeling that way?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earning money when running a business is, hopefully, normal and evident. Earning more money every year is a sign of good health for a company. Problems arise when, to make money, &lt;strong&gt;people cross the ethical frontiers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a non-exhaustive list of questions that raises ethical problems to me and that I would like to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many companies gather personal information about people to compute them and make money from them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many of those companies are considered examples for younger developers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many women are less paid than their men peers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people don't have valid experience on the web because of inaccessible content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much energy do we spend running all those services in the cloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single question in this list deserves an entire book to get proper answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this post is not about blaming people that are not aware of the problems. &lt;strong&gt;It aims to make them realize that these things are not okay per se&lt;/strong&gt; and that they should be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-fix-that"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to fix that?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple on the paper, but very hard in practice: &lt;strong&gt;we have to care&lt;/strong&gt;. It's not about just knowing and putting the problems somewhere in our heads and "remembering to tackle them later". &lt;strong&gt;We have to be aware and act concretely&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#choosing-tools-and-services-that-respect-peoples-privacy"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Choosing tools and services that respect people's privacy
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we need to get audience information about our websites, what about using &lt;strong&gt;tools that respect people's privacy&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/"&gt;Plausible.io&lt;/a&gt; is one of them and it allows to get that information without the need for private data (there are others, it's just the one that I use, I don't have any bindings with the company).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the consumer side, if you don't agree with some companies' policies (&lt;a href="https://wicg.github.io/floc/"&gt;you may have heard of some kind of new tracking technics recently&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.privacytools.io/"&gt;Privacy Tools&lt;/a&gt; is a great website giving practical advice, suggesting services and tools to reduce your privacy exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not forced to use (or to be the victims of) tools from mastodons that keep track of &lt;strong&gt;users' moves, through our websites, making us at least, partially responsible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#equity"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Equity
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second point is about gender equity — and I should say equity in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by any means, we spot a salary discrepancy between two people doing the same job, discrimination, or even harassment, &lt;strong&gt;we have to bring the problem up&lt;/strong&gt;. We're not forced to react intensely, we can gently raise the flag and create a discussion. &lt;strong&gt;But it's important to raise that flag&lt;/strong&gt;. We have to communicate, try to understand and find a way the fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We should not hesitate to be vocal and to support our colleagues&lt;/strong&gt; when they need us, let's offer them our help, and manifest ourselves to improve the situation. Multiple voices have more impact than a single one from a person that faces professional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiding and keeping information because we don't feel concerned (or not comfortable) is selfish and unethical. It contributes somehow to keeping this problem real but also hidden.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#embracing-accessibility"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Embracing Accessibility
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third point is about accessibility. I can't say how grateful I am to have been introduced to it by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amber1ey"&gt;Amberley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madalynrose"&gt;Madalyn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One amazing effect of accessibility is that when you learn enough of it, you immediately become an advocate and can't do without it. Accessibility is an ethical topic where &lt;strong&gt;everybody&lt;/strong&gt; should be provided with a frictionless user experience when using a service or a tool — and it does not only apply to people that can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what's happening on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with accessibility, to me, is that &lt;strong&gt;the number of people who have already built a truly accessible website is very low&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't blame anyone for not having this knowledge, I have personally never heard of it in school nor during my first 6 years working in the industry. But it's important to be aware of it, to educate ourselves, and to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not familiar with accessibility, I suggest reading &lt;a href="https://dev.to/hichamelbsi/accessibility-is-a-priority-3jbf"&gt;Accessibility is a priority&lt;/a&gt; published by one of my colleagues that provides practical wins to make your website more accessible. Also, I highly recommend spending time on &lt;a href="https://a11y.coffee/"&gt;A11y Coffee&lt;/a&gt; to completely dive into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have to keep in mind that making our websites more accessible is a game-changer for more people than we think, we and our companies included. Not making this is, to me, as serious as discriminating a whole population&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ecology-green-it"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ecology, green IT
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point of my bullet list is about energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very tough topic since our job is to build things running on electrical devices and so, our creations consume a certain amount of energy, often time 24/7. &lt;strong&gt;We live in an era of over-consumption and as technical people, we love innovation. The thing is, sometimes, innovation creates more indirect or invisible problems than it solves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We obviously have to change the way we consume, reducing wasting, &lt;strong&gt;making sure our electronic devices (that are built using a gigantic amount of natural resources) reach their lifespan&lt;/strong&gt; before getting new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning our web creations, two things can be done to reduce their footprints: &lt;strong&gt;hosting them on a "Green Hosting" provider that has a low &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness"&gt;PUE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;using the right tools for the right job&lt;/strong&gt;. What would be the real advantages of building a blog with a server-side technology on a whole Kubernetes cluster to only serve a few posts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you come from the React ecosystem, I've written a post about &lt;a href="https://mfrachet.github.io/blog/choosing-a-rendering-strategy/"&gt;the different rendering strategies I would adopt depending on the circumstances&lt;/a&gt; that help me &lt;strong&gt;avoiding server-side rendering when I don't need it&lt;/strong&gt;. And for French people, &lt;a href="https://www.greenit.fr"&gt;Green It&lt;/a&gt; proposes workshops and books about improving website footprints at the code level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the auditing side, I've recently discovered two tools to measure, or at least to provide an order of growth, of the energy consumed by a website: &lt;a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/"&gt;WebsiteCarbon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/marmelab/argos"&gt;Argos&lt;/a&gt;. I don't have that much feedback on them but the intent deserves at least respect and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think"&gt;The internet accounts for around 4% of the greenhouse gas emissions which is the same amount as the whole airline industry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#educating-teaching-learning"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Educating, teaching, learning
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I voluntarily skipped the second point in the list and it's, for me, probably the most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger developers may dream of fame and be part of an elite, wanting to join big companies because "they are the place to be". There is nothing wrong with that but there are some correlations between some topics addressed in this post and some companies that people are dreaming to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure we don't commit to the same errors as we did in the past such as encouraging innovation in potentially ethically discussable directions, I think it's our role, as more senior developers, mentors, and older adults &lt;strong&gt;to sensitize youngers and to educate them to reduce this kind of problems in the future, making them "exceptions" and not the norm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hopefully, we should educate ourselves, too, because, you know, it's not the fault of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
