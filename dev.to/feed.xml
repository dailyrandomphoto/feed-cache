      <guid>https://dev.to/mayank0508/things-you-should-master-before-you-jump-on-react-js-4d1a</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1&gt; What is React.js ?? &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&lt;/u&gt;, this is a must. Even if you have basic understanding about that its enough to get started in React.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EmWwtjNh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ce5bg48x8dnb9rujf01y.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EmWwtjNh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ce5bg48x8dnb9rujf01y.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Basic understanding of ES6/ES7 features of Javascript.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started you should at least know the following features:&lt;br&gt;
    a. Let&lt;br&gt;
    b. Const&lt;br&gt;
    c. Classes&lt;br&gt;
    d. Arrow functions&lt;br&gt;
    e. Imports and Exports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4okDZ6k5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68hx6dp5xfl2wjagiuqz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4okDZ6k5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68hx6dp5xfl2wjagiuqz.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of how to use npm/yarn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7hXlhBny--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zopt91ioe6qhvtcsbnfu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7hXlhBny--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zopt91ioe6qhvtcsbnfu.png" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 3 things are the most important things you should know to get stared with &lt;strong&gt;React.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a good understanding about these things you are pretty good to get started in the React.js world, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would like to give you one more tip that is that never doubt you self by looking at someone's success, believe in you self and learn and try to beat yourself everyday! with time you will get better in it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 3 Online Business to Start in India</title>
      <author>ArjunPatel33</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 08:45:20 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/arjunpatel/top-3-online-business-to-start-in-india-25ng</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many respects, digital technology has altered our lives. One of the most significant effects has been the opening up of new opportunities for employment on the internet. Gone are the times when working a 9-5 job or owning a land-based business was the only way to make a living for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various possibilities for launching an online business today, all of which, if done correctly, may provide a substantial income and help you achieve economic independence quickly. Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach to beginning an online company, we have outlined the basic guidelines that most profitable online operations follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some easy steps, learn how to start an online business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognize a need and provide a plausible solution to meet it.&lt;br&gt;
Create a visually appealing but user-friendly website.&lt;br&gt;
Write text that will entice prospective consumers.&lt;br&gt;
To generate visitors to your site, use prominent search engines and social media sites.&lt;br&gt;
Make an effort to develop a professional reputation for your business and yourself.&lt;br&gt;
Keep in touch with your clients and subscribers through email regularly.&lt;br&gt;
Back-end purchases and up-selling can help you earn more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to decide on your online business once you know the driving principles behind every thriving online business. With so many possibilities available today, making a decision might be challenging – but the ideal strategy is to discover your fundamental talents first and then weave your company concept around them. If you enjoy writing, for example, you may try your hand at freelance writing or blogging on the internet. Website/app development is an alternative if technology is your strong suit.&lt;br&gt;
If you live a healthy lifestyle and have a fit physique, establishing an online fitness coaching business may be a good match for you. Similarly, if you have excellent people skills, starting an online teaching/advising consultancy may be a good match for you.&lt;br&gt;
In a nutshell, there is something for everybody when it comes to launching an online enterprise or business. But if you are still stumped, check out these three most exemplary internet business ideas I've compiled below. If you discover something you enjoy or are excellent at, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analyst Consultant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a solid foundation in math, economy, and/or finance, then this might be an excellent internet business opportunity for you. Companies and huge enterprises are increasingly looking for individuals that can evaluate enormous amounts of big data in the digital era. This is where you enter the picture. As a big data consultant, you will assist them in decoding massive amounts of data to uncover critical information about customer behaviour, spending patterns, regional preferences, and other factors that they can use to fine-tune their company strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the supply of data analysts in India has been unable to keep up with demands, you should be capable of making enough to live a comfortable lifestyle by giving your skills to a major organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hard work and dedication, continued learning in a few years you might even grow and compete with India’s biggest companies like NeenOpal, &lt;a href="https://thirdeyedata.io/"&gt;ThirdEyeData&lt;/a&gt; and many others who started the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casino affiliate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A casino affiliate is a business that works in collaboration with any online casino to promote the latter. He or she will be paid a commission for every player who visits the casino site or deposits money through a special affiliate link. Affiliates can choose from a variety of payment options, and casinos can provide many options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of casinos have affiliate programs. Nevertheless, affiliate marketing has grown ingrained in the online gambling sector, and many companies are eager to hire affiliates to expand their potential reach. The initial step is to visit the affiliate link page of a company. This is usually accessed by a link in the casino's footer, and it contains vital information you will have to understand before being an affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is free to sign up as an affiliate, but bear in mind that this is simply the first step. You will need to utilize your distinctive affiliate link once you have received it. Blogging is a popular alternative for inexperienced affiliates, and many affiliates begin their careers as casino bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliate links can be included in advertisements, pop-ups, text ads, and other forms of web content. A new affiliate must consider who their target audience is and what type of material they react to most. Knowing the fundamentals of a good site, the role of various types of material, and combining all of this into a compelling online source for visitors and potential players are required to be a successful affiliate. A great example of a website of this kind is &lt;a href="https://www.casinobonus.in/"&gt;Casino Bonus India&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website lists all types of casino bonuses that players can claim and start playing. Also they cover a lot of informative content about Casino Games, Casino News, Guides and Ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO Expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every company with a digital platform, search engine optimisation, or SEO, is crucial. It entails employing keywords in material that correspond to the most often sought terms on Google and other search engines. As a result, the website with the most excellent SEO optimised content generally appears in the top few pages of a connected Google search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While larger organizations have dedicated SEO teams to guarantee their websites remain at the top of search engine ranking factors, most smaller businesses cannot afford this expenditure, putting them at a serious disadvantage to their larger competitors. As an SEO professional, you might contact such businesses and offer your expertise as an SEO consultant to help level the playing field. For businesses, this may be a terrific way to balance the field while making money and gaining new clientele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to follow &lt;a href="https://neilpatel.com/"&gt;Neil Patel&lt;/a&gt; he is one of the most famous Indian SEOs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the internet quickly infiltrating homes and businesses worldwide, it makes good financial sense to consider launching your own online business. While some of the ideas mentioned above may need special talents or expertise, many others may be accomplished with only a computer and internet access. The goal is to make the appropriate decision - one that is in line with what you want to achieve and your professional abilities and expertise. So consider twice before deciding on any online business concept, but once you have chosen, don't turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other online business that you think will succeed in India?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Boilerplates for websites/app building</title>
      <author>Kritika Srivastava</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 08:09:58 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/kritika27/boilerplates-for-websites-app-building-2n0m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Dev Friends.As we are learning web development, we often get overwhelmed with so much to learn and practice.Then why don't we simplify our learning by identifying the repeated patterns in our code.So let us have a look at what are the similar components you are repeating in almost every app and still not mastering it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Navbar:This is the basic component which every application will have.Then first learn how to make one basic navbar.&lt;br&gt;
It will have atleast a brand logo and list of menus for navigating to different pages.Use CSS-Flexbox or CSS-Grid to align it properly.To make it responsive you can make toggle bar using JavaScript or align the items in center row-wise for smaller devices.&lt;br&gt;
Here is the example of my application which you can refer to.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;a href="https://github.com/kritika27/recipe-page-html-css"&gt;Github Repository Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GKOmSDje--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0ebsu6tc1h8402gzyah.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GKOmSDje--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0ebsu6tc1h8402gzyah.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Footer:This is another basic component which you can style using social media icons from &lt;a href="https://fontawesome.com/"&gt;FontAwesome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can also have a fixed footer.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;a href="https://github.com/kritika27/restaurant-website"&gt;Github Repository Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TF7548wz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tdzalirxw8nxbcofqycj.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TF7548wz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tdzalirxw8nxbcofqycj.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Homepage with a background image:Learn to atleast make a single webpage with a full background image,some text in center and a navbar.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;a href="https://github.com/kritika27/recipe-page-html-css"&gt;Github Repository Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GKOmSDje--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0ebsu6tc1h8402gzyah.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GKOmSDje--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0ebsu6tc1h8402gzyah.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Basic landing page:Whether you are building any Business website or E-commerce web app,it is incomplete without a landing page.&lt;br&gt;
It will consist of a homepage describing about the product,may be featured products,services,photo gallery of different products,contact form,footer,etc.&lt;br&gt;
You can include whatever you want based on what you are building.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;a href="https://github.com/kritika27/furniture-website-react-firebase"&gt;Github Repository Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aq3GbhqL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xqg65fvr32k7on4l348d.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aq3GbhqL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xqg65fvr32k7on4l348d.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.Products page:This is another component you will be building to display the products in grid.So you can display the items using CSS-grid and CSS-flexbox.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;a href="https://github.com/kritika27/ecommerce-store-reactjs-stripe-oauth2"&gt;Github Repository Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d9H15IwF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vjgpx9pe8e8kqkfxqb1z.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--d9H15IwF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vjgpx9pe8e8kqkfxqb1z.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.Products detailed page:If you are coding in React then you can use React Router to create a product detailed page.You can fetch the data from external api or the local file. &lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;a href="https://github.com/kritika27/ecommerce-store-reactjs-stripe-oauth2"&gt;Github Repository Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xQTNrHzi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h93u38cavzpore82lu23.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xQTNrHzi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h93u38cavzpore82lu23.jpg" alt="Alt Text"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more components apart from these too but let us start with these first.I always try to quote examples from what I have built instead of copy-pasting tutorial links and others' examples from internet.&lt;br&gt;
Feel free to come up with your own examples and share with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding :)&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Vim: Enhancing Movement Speed</title>
      <author>Meet Gor</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2021 07:48:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/mrdestructive/vim-enhancing-movement-speed-59g8</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/mrdestructive/vim-enhancing-movement-speed-59g8</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#introduction"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK! Vim and movent are like bread and butter or failed brakes. To become a proficient Vim user, you need to move in Vim very effectively. You don't have to think about doing certain things, your fingertips should automatically move without wasting time thinking about it. I am sure, it takes time and effort but OH! it is so rewarding in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#why-h-j-k-l"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Why H J K L?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, unmap arrow keys and make a habit of using h,j,k, and l. Yes, this would not make any sense in the initial stage but that will make no sense for not using it later. &lt;br&gt;
The thing with H J K L is that they are quite flexible to work with and if you use it with numbers you would navigate much faster than arrow keys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#moving-horizontally"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Moving Horizontally.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite the common movement that every programmer uses most of the time. This is also a much-neglected part when movement in Vim is concerned. To the basics, we use the following commands: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;   -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move forward by a word (considering punctuations as separate words).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;   -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move forward by a word (punctuations ignored).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move backward by a word (considering punctuations as separate words).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move backward by a word (punctuations ignored).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move to end of a word (considering punctuations as separate words).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move to end of a word (punctuations ignored).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move to the beginning of a sentence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;  -   &lt;strong&gt;move to the end of a sentence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the most useful and common commands for moving across the line. Don't forget to use the number before the command to repeat the task for that number of times. Like for example, if you would like to go 6 words ahead type in &lt;code&gt;6w&lt;/code&gt;. This can improve your thinking and typing as well, good signs of a programmer Eh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#moving-vertically"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Moving Vertically.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To move vertically we can imagine moving within a file or the block of code. For moving in a file, the following are some useful commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gg&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; ** move to the beginning of a file.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move to the end of a file.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + e&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;move the screen down without moving the cursor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + y&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move the screen up without moving the cursor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + f&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move forward one entire screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + b&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; *&lt;em&gt;move backward one entire screen. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + d&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move forward half screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + u&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move backward half screen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just was moving around the screen and now a bit programmatic movement. We will see some keystrokes to move in code blocks or code snippets very efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gd&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the local declaration of any code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gD&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the global declaration of any code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move between pairs of ( ), { }, [ ] or any other type of such braces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the next paragraph/ code block/ function/ etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the previous paragraph/ code block/ functions/ etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fa&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; *&lt;em&gt;move to the next occurrence of the character 'a' in a sentence. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fa&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; *&lt;em&gt;move to the previous occurrence of the character 'a' in a sentence. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ta&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;jump to before of the next occurrence of the character 'a' in a sentence.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ta&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; ** jump to after of the previous occurrence of the character 'a' in a sentence. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above might be quite handy key shortcuts in moving in a large code file. Even in files with complex variable names and structures, this can be quite handy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#search-and-navigation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Search and navigation.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching is quite a time-consuming task, especially when the code is quite complex and has a lot of variables and all. Vim shines in many of such aspects where people think it's dead. It rises from the ashes to produce a performance-driven experience like any other modern IDEs though it requires a bit of research:) Here are some commands that will make searching and navigating around it quite a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;next occurrence of the word under the cursor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; *&lt;em&gt;previous occurrence of the word under the cursor. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;next occurrence of the word searched pattern.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;previous occurrence of the word searched pattern.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above commands will also work if you search the pattern from the command mode.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;/pattern&lt;/code&gt;  or &lt;code&gt;?pattern&lt;/code&gt; Enter and navigate to the next(&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;) and previous(&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;) occurrence of that pattern match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#moving-across-files"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Moving across files.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving across files without any plugins or file explorer is often considered tricky or impossible for some people but there is a way. You can switch between files using the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + O&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;   &lt;strong&gt;move in the previously opened file.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + I&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  *&lt;em&gt;move in the next file. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also can use &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + ^&lt;/code&gt; to move the previous two opened files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to switch from buffers, you can use &lt;code&gt;:bn&lt;/code&gt; for moving into the next buffer, and &lt;code&gt;:bp&lt;/code&gt; to move in the previous buffer. You always have an option to move from a buffer using the file name &lt;code&gt;:b filename&lt;/code&gt; or using the index as &lt;code&gt;:bindex&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#moving-between-tabs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Moving between Tabs.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People rarely use Tabs as far as I have seen, but they are quite useful and provide the polish off just as robust IDEs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:tabnew filename&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;create a Tab of a file.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the next tab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngt&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the nth tab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gT&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move to the previous tab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:tabo&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; **close all the tabs except the current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:tabc&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;close the tab.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;:tabm n&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move the current tab to nth position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#movement-in-marks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Movement in Marks.
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marks are used for some quite large files and code-bases. It is used to move from one mark(kind of a bookmark) to another using few key commands, marks are generally created when you would go to a particular code block or any part of the file again and again. Some of the quick navigation using maps are the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mn&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;set the current position as mark 'a'.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;jump to the position of mark 'n'.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;jump to the position where vim was last exited.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;"`  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;jump to the position when the last edit was made in the file.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#split-windows-movement"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Split Windows Movement
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + w + r&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move the split down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + w + R&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;move the split up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + w + h&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;jump to the left split.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + w + j&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;jump to the split down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + w + k&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;jump to the upper split.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + w + l&lt;/code&gt;  -&amp;gt;  &lt;strong&gt;jump to the left split.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use Caps H J K L to move the leftmost, bottom, uppermost, rightmost split respectively. &lt;br&gt;
That just was quick to make you enough faster than previous hassles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was probably it, these were some tricks and shortcuts to move around Vim pretty effectively and smoothly. Moving around Vim can be quite complicated at once, but it's just finding the key shortcuts to make you feel and glid in VIm. There might be quite a lot of shortcuts missing, If you have any quicker shortcuts, Please let me know in the comments.  Happy Viming :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So around one month ago i created a simple social media site because i was bored and after publishing i got a good response by many peoples and 100+ users registered on website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i thought why don't update and make a proper website. Also it's a good project for my resume so 8 days ago i started creating this project called &lt;strong&gt;Noob&lt;/strong&gt; and today I'm gonna make that project public so check it out and write your review :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website is still in development, Working on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+Comment System&lt;br&gt;
+Follow System&lt;br&gt;
+Notification's&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website Link : &lt;a href="https://noob.study"&gt;noob.study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Github Link : &lt;a href="https://github.com/NV404/noob"&gt;Github.com/NV404/noob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, just clone the repository and run &lt;code&gt;npm install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/NV404/Emote.git
npm install
npm run dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you are running on Windows run install --noptional flag (i.e. &lt;code&gt;npm install --no-optional&lt;/code&gt;) which will skip installing fsevents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://dev.to/chetan_atrawalkar/how-to-avoid-stress-during-coding-56f1</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you want to know how to dealing with stress while coding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here's some tips to do when you're feeling stressful and make mood relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Do Some Light Stretching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Stretching can be an effective strategy for preventing and alleviating stress. One way that it does so is by lengthening the muscles to relieve tension. Most of us experience a good deal of stress in our daily lives, especially us software developers during coding time. There never seems to be enough time in the day! And that stress builds up without our realizing it, creating physical and mental stiffness. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6KmLDmPf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679969/Dev/1_vsrnvf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6KmLDmPf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679969/Dev/1_vsrnvf.png" alt="stretching"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Step Outside And Explore Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. It may even reduce mortality, according to scientists such as public health researchers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vA4lcFfA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679969/Dev/2_kfpryp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vA4lcFfA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679969/Dev/2_kfpryp.png" alt="Nature"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Play Your Favourite Video Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Video games are engaging and enjoyable, which reduces stress. Gaming results in dopamine secretion, which makes you feel good. Video games present a challenge and reward you for overcoming it, which leads to feelings of competence. Gaming can create a flow state, which is similar to meditation. Video games give you instant rewards, which help to reduce the stress of achieving long term goals.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7iIghVXD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679969/Dev/3_xmjbqv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7iIghVXD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679969/Dev/3_xmjbqv.png" alt="Video Games"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Call A Family Members Or Friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you’re feeling stressed, take a break to call a friend or your family member and talk about your problems. Good relationships with friends and loved ones are important to any healthy lifestyle. They’re especially important when you’re under a lot of stress. A reassuring voice, even for a minute, can put everything in perspective.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SiceaKYL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/4_qlpisd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SiceaKYL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/4_qlpisd.png" alt="call a friend"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5. Read A Book That Inspires You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Research has shown that reading fiction is more effective at reducing stress than listening to music, sipping tea, and taking a walk. In fact, stress levels were shown to be reduced by 68 percent after reading. While your brain is engaged in the story, your heart rate slows down and muscles relax. Because there is so much work for your brain to do, reading is a very effective way to focus your energy and improve your concentration.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wHXE5JHH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/5_j2yqkh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wHXE5JHH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/5_j2yqkh.png" alt="Read book"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6. Meet Up With Your Best Friend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During stressful times, being around a best friend decreases levels of the stress hormones. Having good friends and a strong social support network can relieve stress. One study published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine found that people who discussed difficult times in their lives had a lower pulse and blood pressure when they had a friend by their side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zaoqJI_r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/6_u3kzbf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zaoqJI_r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/6_u3kzbf.png" alt="Meet Up With friend"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7. Eat Your Favourite Snacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most of time developers continuously write codes and feel stressful, so this time take a break and eat a favourite snacks or stress relief food. While there are many ways to cope with stress, one strategy is to eat stress-fighting foods. Like Chocolate, nuts, yogurt, fatty fish, banana, carrots etc.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y737uV8J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/7_cbptyh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--y737uV8J--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://res.cloudinary.com/chetan-ca/image/upload/v1624679968/Dev/7_cbptyh.png" alt="food"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create Promises with Timeout Error in Typescript</title>
      <author>Nikos Anifantis</author>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cover Photo by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@macroman?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"&gt;Immo Wegmann&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-problem-thinking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Problem 🤔
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we create promises that take too long to finish and we don't want to wait. For example, if we want to make a request and the response takes 20 seconds to finish and for any reason we may want to throw an error in the first 5 seconds and proceed to the next code block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will see how to implement a promise which throws an error after a specific time span. It supports typings with the power of Typescript and accepts a custom error to be thrown when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation-rocket"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation 🚀
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, we create a new promise that rejects an error after a time span in milliseconds. The return type of the timeout promise is &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt; which represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt; is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create a promise that rejects in milliseconds&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to use &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race"&gt;Promise.race()&lt;/a&gt; which returns a &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt; that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise. Here you can see that we have used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; generic type that it will be defined in our final function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;race&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;anyOtherPromise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Great, we saw all code blocks, let's see the full implementation below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promiseWithTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeoutError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Promise timed out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// create a promise that rejects in milliseconds&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;never&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// returns a race between timeout and the passed promise&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;race&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have created a function that accepts the following arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;promise&lt;/code&gt;: our actual promise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;: the maximum time in milliseconds which we want to wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;timeoutError&lt;/code&gt;: (optional) we may pass a custom error to throw after timeout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can find the final source code in stackblitz:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/promise-with-timeout-rwt8ye?embed=1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;" width="100%" height="500"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion-whitecheckmark"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion ✅
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray, we made it to the end! I hope you enjoyed this post and do not wait for time consuming promises any more 😆.&lt;/p&gt;
