      <guid>https://dev.to/nerajno/6-strategies-learnt-from-6-months-of-job-hunting-14hn</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After months of applying, interviewing, building, practising, connecting with others in the industry and being ghosted, I got an email that would change my previous situation, #opentowork to currently at &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XYZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The email started with the line I spent months waiting to hear. &lt;em&gt;“We are pleased to offer you the position of Fullstack Developer.”&lt;/em&gt;  I think I stared at it for a few minutes and double-checked the header to make sure it wasn’t an ill-mannered prank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's see, it's been 182 days had passed since I last had a paying position. That was followed by 6 months of job hunting and believe me .... it is literally &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hunting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Job hunting or seeking or questing is one of the least spoken about skills that developers needs. If I was supposed to deconstruct this skill to its purest form,  it's learning to sell yourself as a solution to a potential employer's need/problem. One should also remember you are not meant for every opportunity that you seek. Your personality, skill set, how you approach a problem and relate to people is unique, even if I am the only person to tell you that one fact. Believe me. So here are six lessons I learned while on the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#networking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Networking
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tFEdClDs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_Vsra7WUAcqx43%3Fformat%3Djpg%26name%3Dlarge" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tFEdClDs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_Vsra7WUAcqx43%3Fformat%3Djpg%26name%3Dlarge" alt="Networking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the sum of the six people you surround yourself with. I think that’s one of the lessons I learned from skimming the book: &lt;em&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey&lt;/em&gt;.  I decided to surround myself with those I could learn from, but it didn’t stop at coding or developers, as my future demanded a different version of me. I took the time to become an active participant in certain communities both virtually and in-person (namely &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp"&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies"&gt;CodeNewbies&lt;/a&gt;, the tech side of Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/techsofcolor"&gt;Technologists of Color&lt;/a&gt; and most recently, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VirtualCoffeeIO"&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;), this meant commenting, presenting, talking, listening, contributing from your unique skillset, asking for help, participating and building new connections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stepped out of my comfort zone, and if you know anything about my past career and life as a middle school teacher, stepping out of one’s comfort zone is the beginning of understanding. And where understanding is wisdom will surely follow (we hope, at least !!!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as you continue to seek your next role, it's important to make your presence known and felt by becoming a part of communities..... not a community. You want to reach a place of connecting with the mind and talents from all walks of life. Coding isn’t just about understanding a specific language JavaScript or Ruby, it’s understanding how the code will solve a human problem. The same can be said about people, you might gain some understanding from other disciplines to help you write better code and see the world clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are new to building a network, I recommend meetups ~ virtually, online communities, LinkedIn, Twitter, twitter-chats ( looking at you #CodeNewbie and ), Slack communities, blogging communities [Dev.to, Medium, Hashnode, etc.]. And if you are asking me to tell you how to build a community on LinkedIn, no worries, I made a whole section for that and a bit more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#linkedin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  LinkedIn
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wSp7Fpu0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/267350/pexels-photo-267350.jpeg%3Fcs%3Dsrgb%26dl%3Dpexels-pixabay-267350.jpg%26fm%3Djpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wSp7Fpu0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/267350/pexels-photo-267350.jpeg%3Fcs%3Dsrgb%26dl%3Dpexels-pixabay-267350.jpg%26fm%3Djpg" alt="test Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn has changed over the last five years to become more than just a job-seeking site to one where professionals can share their insight and learn from each other. And yes, even the occasional joke can pop up in your feed. But it matters how you connect with others and what they share. No, I am not saying that you should spend all your time on another social media platform when you could be programming. What I am saying is that if you post once a week with questions, sharing your insight, talking about your experience, you will be in the 1% of people who post on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn has over 740 million users each year, and with one weekly post, you can land in the eyes of your dream job. Companies are looking for people who can tell their stories. Can you? Before you say, “But, I don’t know what to post, and no one will read it.” You’re wrong, you need to understand your writing is owning your space in this ecosystem. Here’s a &lt;br&gt;
 few repeatable steps you can use to build your network on LinkedIn : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post your favourite quote and who said it, bonus points if it helped you to become a better developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell a story of how you got started. What sparked your curiosity or what did you want to build?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comment rather than just liking a post. It builds engagement and sometimes your opinion is just what is needed on the post. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When sending or making a new connection, write a note saying who you are, what you hope to learn from the person, what value you can bring to the relationship and/or where you met. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to have a virtual coffee, just say so. Make sure you are respectful of the other person’s time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrate each other’s wins and send someone a small note of encouragement when you see they need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn, essentially, is about connecting with other people with shared professional interests, remember to treat them as human first, and having an interest in job hunting maybe later. One of the best pieces of advice I have ever gotten on LinkedIn was to listen to this &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3zqYNXc"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev"&gt;Danny Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, make notes and implement them accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#portfolio"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Portfolio
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a4649e1a31118d6f275e67bd80fe5601770247e8ad0497165e441e9148eaf35/68747470733a2f2f696d6167652e6962622e636f2f6535754266302f436170747572652e706e67" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a4649e1a31118d6f275e67bd80fe5601770247e8ad0497165e441e9148eaf35/68747470733a2f2f696d6167652e6962622e636f2f6535754266302f436170747572652e706e67" alt="Portfolio Screenshot Example"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’re looking for a job, but what do you have to prove you can do it? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building a portfolio is essential in today’s job market&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, note my strong emphasis.  Learn to show off your project because your future self needs to learn how to advocate for yourself and your future employer needs to see it. The creation of a portfolio that demonstrates your ability to problem-solve, your tech-stack, documentation of your process, and creative tools you know how to use was more essential to getting an interview than you may think. If you are transitioning from consulting /freelancing to seeking a full-time position at a company, having a well-rounded portfolio that speaks to their interest and tech stack can be the deciding factor that lands you that new opportunity.&lt;br&gt;
      All your portfolio should contain at least 3-4 projects with technologies that you feel competent and comfortable explaining. Each project should have a well-documented repository with a live version &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(preferably if applicable)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Here are two different resources you can use to create or fix your portfolio, &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/39lkOw8"&gt;Ultimate Guide to Creating a Programmer Portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nrWGr2OvBD4"&gt;10 Web Developer Portfolio Tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#resume"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Resume
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2APtCVVQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/5989933/pexels-photo-5989933.jpeg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26cs%3Dtinysrgb%26dpr%3D2%26h%3D650%26w%3D940" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2APtCVVQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/5989933/pexels-photo-5989933.jpeg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26cs%3Dtinysrgb%26dpr%3D2%26h%3D650%26w%3D940" alt="Resume Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resumes can be a fickle thing, but you’ll need one and a very solid one. It can help you highlight your portfolio and further demonstrate your capability for your dream role. On any given day, one should have three versions of their resume, one with all their professional experience, one with all their tech experience and for each role, a tailored version. I am an advocate for one to constantly revising and updating each with new experiences and skills acquired over a 4-6 week period.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that you are more than just your resume, you may not have all the skills now, but your resume should help to display your ability to learn as one of your greatest assets. If you are looking for tips on how to create a good developer resume, check out  &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JEPqB0x8Cns"&gt;Guidance Counselor 2.0 + How to Actually Write a Resume by Taylor Desseyn&lt;/a&gt;, any of his &lt;a href="https://www.taylordesseyn.com/freeguides"&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; that align with resume creation with developers in mind. FreeCodeCamp's  &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=resume%20"&gt;guides&lt;/a&gt; are also good references for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core skill of being a developer is taking the time to hone your skills; whether by taking on new challenges or collaborating with others to become a part of communities around yourself. As you are what you do repeatedly, a better developer is someone is who makes the time to refine the application of their skill set to solve a problem. Practising, however,  doesn’t just mean coding alone full steam on a project, learning how to collaborate is a form of practice. Making time to read, make notes and build is a form of practice. Reading other’s experiences can help you develop your approach to coding and building a new product is a form of practice. Remember that actively practising includes resting, taking care of your body, and don’t forget to connect with your friends in any way you can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few resources that speak to this topic :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--any41prV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/7376/startup-photos.jpg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26cs%3Dtinysrgb%26dpr%3D2%26h%3D650%26w%3D940" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--any41prV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/7376/startup-photos.jpg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26cs%3Dtinysrgb%26dpr%3D2%26h%3D650%26w%3D940" alt="Routine test Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  Creating Routines
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Don't give up. Obstacles can be overcome through strategy and learning. ~ Hidetaka Miyazaki." (Canva the quote and add as an image)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From no-job having status to job-having status is a big leap as the dynamics of your life change. Not surprisingly though getting there without focus and discipline is almost a work of God. One begs to ask how one gets a new position? Everyone I have asked that question has a different answer, but one aspect of their answer remained the same— creating a routine that works for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially you should break the goal of securing a job into smaller steps. So take the time to sit down and analyze all the components that come with looking for a job as a software developer ( deliberate practice, collaboration with other developers, job applications, responding to emails, creating content, participating in communities, going to meetups and virtual coffees, etc). Next, start by creating repeatable actions that will give you some form of control, think themed days or activities that put you in the mindset to code; think of creating a schedule and then sticking to it. Limit distractions and GET TO WORK !!!! This is never gonna work unless you do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we need to create a project with a goal in mind (What should it do for us). The schedule helps you stay on track to finish your project in a specific number of days or time slots. Use this as a template to demonstrate your workflow to future employers. Remember to be kind to yourself when setting up a routine, it takes at least 21-65 to form a habit, and you already have the blueprints to an amazing routine. Here are some additional steps you can take to create better routines that will help with the job hunt : * &lt;a href="https://www.trilogyed.com/blog/10-effective-job-search-strategies-according-to-a-software-engineer/"&gt;10 Effective Job Search Strategies, According to a Software Engineer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Things To Consider
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yQRj15zk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/1194197/pexels-photo-1194197.jpeg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26cs%3Dtinysrgb%26dpr%3D2%26w%3D500" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yQRj15zk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://images.pexels.com/photos/1194197/pexels-photo-1194197.jpeg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26cs%3Dtinysrgb%26dpr%3D2%26w%3D500" alt="test Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many developers fail to reach out to their communities when they need help. Be proactive. Build bridges so you can cross them and meet other people. Write about your experience, trust me, you could be helping someone who is having a hard time. Stay consistent and keep going. Please remember, a closed mouth doesn’t get fed and as you’ve heard the argument many times it bears repeating. Consider asking for an opportunity to show your work or help someone else as that is a part of your advocacy. As time goes by, you become a part of a community for a reason; ask for what you need. So start a blog, tweet about it, post on LinkedIn. Do whatever it takes to get the word out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a talented developer, and you will need others around you to amplify your voice. Learn to shout together.  But the most important thing to consider is to be kind to yourself. You are so much more than your job hunting process/progress. You are human, lovely and flawed, creating a solution with code that can change the world. Believe in yourself, and others will learn to have faith in your work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are but the first six strategies that came to my mind while thinking about what to write. I would appreciate any feedback or your own tips. Find me &lt;em&gt;"&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nerajno"&gt;@nerajno&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/em&gt; if you would like to chat, my DMs are open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My secret sauce is that I have an editor and i tend to just string together ideas and she adds some body to them. Her name is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JJnibbles"&gt;Joy&lt;/a&gt;. She is a storyteller, home cook, poet, and writing consultant. She enjoys talking about building communities and the human condition. If you find her in a bookstore, approach her carefully with snacks. When she isn't banging her head against a desk to write, you can find her drinking tea and reading a book. (probably a biography or manga).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#fin-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  FIN !
&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>How to run docker on Windows without Docker Desktop</title>

      <link>https://dev.to/_nicolas_louis_/how-to-run-docker-on-windows-without-docker-desktop-hik</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/_nicolas_louis_/how-to-run-docker-on-windows-without-docker-desktop-hik</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since  Docker announced a new subscription for Docker Desktop for personal use, educational institutions, non-commercial open-source projects and small businesses, other enterprises need to acquire licences for all installations of Docker Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is there an alternative on Windows to continue to legally use containers with a docker command and a nice UI like VSCode without paying a licence : the answer is YES !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are doing magic with Windows 10, Ubuntu on WSL2, &lt;em&gt;docker builder cli&lt;/em&gt; for windows and a little elbow grease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Thanks to Jonathan Bowman for &lt;a href="https://dev.to/bowmanjd/install-docker-on-windows-wsl-without-docker-desktop-34m9"&gt;his article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reused and I adapted it to make &lt;em&gt;VisualCode&lt;/em&gt; working with &lt;strong&gt;dockerd&lt;/strong&gt; under WSL2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-on-windows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation on Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your windows, you need to install a couple of things :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WSL2 : &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#step-2-update-to-wsl-2"&gt;Install WSL | Microsoft Docs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu on WSL2 : in Microsoft Store Ubuntu 20.04 LTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Code : it can be downloaded at &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker extension for VSCode : directly from Visual Code Extensions Marketplace
&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ONarkfTn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p4l24p641gi3paubq2c2.png" alt="VSCode Docker extension"&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installation-of-dockerd-in-wsl2ubuntu"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installation of dockerd in WSL2/Ubuntu
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Inspired from the Jonathan Bowman's article)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#is-your-user-a-sudoer-"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Is your user a "sudoer" ?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check if &lt;strong&gt;sudo&lt;/strong&gt; is installed if not : &lt;code&gt;*apt install sudo*&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;grep -E 'sudo|wheel' /etc/group&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would see something like  &lt;em&gt;sudo: x:27:myusername&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, We use &lt;strong&gt;usermod&lt;/strong&gt; to add an user to the &lt;em&gt;sudoer&lt;/em&gt; group&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;usermod -aG sudo myusername&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally you can check with this command : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo grep -E '%sudo|%wheel' /etc/sudoers&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll have something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see a # at the first position, the line is commented, run &lt;strong&gt;sudo visudo&lt;/strong&gt;, find the corresponding line and remove the #, save and check again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#update-your-ubuntu-distro"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Update your Ubuntu distro
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#remove-residue-from-previous-docker-installations"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Remove Residue from previous docker installations
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#debianubuntu-package-repository-configuration"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Debian/Ubuntu package repository configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;source /etc/os-release&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust the repo :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;curl -fsSL &lt;a href="https://download.docker.com/linux/%24%7BID%7D/gpg"&gt;https://download.docker.com/linux/${ID}/gpg&lt;/a&gt; | sudo apt-key add -&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update repo info :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;echo "deb [arch=amd64] &lt;a href="https://download.docker.com/linux/%24%7BID%7D"&gt;https://download.docker.com/linux/${ID}&lt;/a&gt; ${VERSION_CODENAME} stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list&lt;br&gt;
sudo apt update&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#install-official-docker-release"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Install official Docker release
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#add-user-to-docker-group"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Add user to docker group
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker $USER&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Then close that WSL window, and launch WSL again. You should see docker when you run the command groups to list group memberships."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#get-ip-address-in-wsl2"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Get IP address in WSL2
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;echo `ifconfig eth0 | grep -E "([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{ print $2 }' | cut -f2 -d:&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have something like  &lt;strong&gt;172.20.5.64&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#launch-dockerd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Launch dockerd
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In WSL, there is no &lt;em&gt;systemd&lt;/em&gt; or other init system. So we need to launch manually docker with the automatic collect of the IP address&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo dockerd -H  `ifconfig eth0 | grep -E "([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{ print $2 }' | cut -f2 -d:&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should be several lines of info, warnings related to tls, and the like, with something like API listen on &lt;strong&gt;172.20.5.64:2375&lt;/strong&gt; at the end. If so, you have success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#test-docker-command"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Test docker command
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the IP address given with the line API listen and In another WSL terminal, you can test the following command :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;docker -H 172.20.5.64 run --rm hello-world&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll get something like this :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello from Docker! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#installing-dockerexe-on-windows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Installing &lt;strong&gt;Docker.exe&lt;/strong&gt; on Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stefan Scherer is maintaining the project docker-cli-builder on &lt;a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-cli-builder/releases"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where we can download the &lt;strong&gt;docker.exe&lt;/strong&gt; command in standalone :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the exe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put it in the directory like &lt;strong&gt;c:\bin&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add this directory in the path for executables : &lt;em&gt;System Properties\Environement Variables\System Variables\Path&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t6CwQGQc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sfwpqdkh8xhy2xhy6hwc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t6CwQGQc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sfwpqdkh8xhy2xhy6hwc.png" alt="Add path to docker binary"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#check-if-docker-is-working"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Check if &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt; is working
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once done, logout from your session and log again&lt;br&gt;
In a windows terminal (Windows Power Shell) , launch :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;docker --version&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would get something like :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker version 20.10.5, build 55c4c8896&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#launch-dockerd"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Launch dockerd
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open a terminal in Wsl2, you execute &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo dockerd -H  `ifconfig eth0 | grep -E "([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" | grep -v 127.0.0.1 |awk '{ print $2 }' | cut -f2 -d:&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you get the IP address, as described before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#test-docker-on-windows"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Test docker on Windows
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Powershell windows of the terminal, you can run the following command&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;c:\bin\docker -H tcp://172.20.5.64 run --rm hello-world&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you would get :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello from Docker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great we have now docker in windows running with WSL2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;But let's continue magic !&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configure-vscode-to-access-to-wsl2-docker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configure VSCode to access to WSL2 docker
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you launch Visual Code and you select the docker extension, you'll get error in the panel asking if docker is installed... Yes of course it's installed but not configured to access to WSL2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4TqeLCkM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4onnmug3igs95alhd9hh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4TqeLCkM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4onnmug3igs95alhd9hh.png" alt="VSCode with docker extension errors"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, click on the icon (?) on the top right of the section "Containers" and select "Edit settings..."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eIDRuGok--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w88fkywtbd5sm4sf1ota.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eIDRuGok--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w88fkywtbd5sm4sf1ota.png" alt="VSCode edit docker settings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll get around 56 settings and you search for  &lt;em&gt;"Docker:Host"&lt;/em&gt;  where you put the line &lt;strong&gt;"tcp://172.20.5.64:2375"&lt;/strong&gt;  where you can replace the highlighted ip address by the one you got before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--egPq8goX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6b02nk14i4xaielwoxr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--egPq8goX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6b02nk14i4xaielwoxr.png" alt="VSCode set Docker:Host"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once done, you come back to the panel and you click on &lt;em&gt;"refresh"&lt;/em&gt; icon (top right of each sections) and you would get information from your &lt;strong&gt;dockerd&lt;/strong&gt; running in WSL2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R86SMWRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ehfyeoma7e96xao94nqn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--R86SMWRm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ehfyeoma7e96xao94nqn.png" alt="VSCode it works"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-everything-works-without-knowing-ip"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making everything works without knowing IP
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how to run &lt;strong&gt;dockerd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;docker&lt;/em&gt; without copy&amp;amp;paste IP address in command line nor VSCode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In WSL2, it's not possible to assign IP address but, I can use the windows port forwarding to redirect a local port from the host to a specific one of my distribution. Hence I could put &lt;strong&gt;"tcp://localhost:2375"&lt;/strong&gt; in VsCode and the calls will be redirected to dockerd running in WSL2-Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, I run the powershell script lines in windows  terminal &lt;em&gt;running as administrator&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;$ip = (wsl sh -c "hostname -I").Split(" ")[0]&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2375 connectport=2375 connectaddress=$ip&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;wsl sh -c "sudo dockerd -H tcp://$ip"&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Script explanation :    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I collect the IP address of my default distro with the wsl command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, I set the port forwarding &lt;em&gt;2375&lt;/em&gt; to my distro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, I launch in my distro dockerd with the IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When executing these lines you'll be prompted to enter your distro password (&lt;em&gt;sudo&lt;/em&gt;) and I'll see after the log of dockerd. Everything will work fine when I'll see the message &lt;em&gt;"API listen on 172.18.75.23:2375"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, in a windows terminal opened in my distro, I can check with &lt;strong&gt;top&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;htop&lt;/strong&gt; if &lt;em&gt;dockerd&lt;/em&gt; processes are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;VSCode&lt;/em&gt;, I update my &lt;em&gt;Docker:Host&lt;/em&gt; setting with &lt;em&gt;tcp://localhost:2375&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y35Mh4J1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cv8ty56xvrw5vjw9tqsm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Y35Mh4J1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cv8ty56xvrw5vjw9tqsm.png" alt="VSCode Docker host to localhost"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the magic is there :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nK65QG9p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/100j4d491bo3f9uq82iq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nK65QG9p--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/100j4d491bo3f9uq82iq.png" alt="VSCode Docker extension working with localhost"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can know create a dedicated powershell script with the previous line : &lt;strong&gt;start_docker.ps1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a windows terminal running with administrator privileges, I set the &lt;em&gt;Execution policy&lt;/em&gt; with  :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every time I want to run &lt;strong&gt;dockerd&lt;/strong&gt;, I launch the &lt;strong&gt;start_docker.ps1&lt;/strong&gt; script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KM_EVu5t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7ft5cjuok5l546a715uz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--KM_EVu5t--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7ft5cjuok5l546a715uz.png" alt="Launch docked from Windows"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you see &lt;em&gt;API Listen on 172.18.75.23:2375&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything works !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yQjNn8b6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1f0xyu8rxvhu13bwai0z.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yQjNn8b6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1f0xyu8rxvhu13bwai0z.png" alt="Logs 1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to use &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt; without &lt;em&gt;-H&lt;/em&gt; parameter, for this, I add a new system environment variable called &lt;em&gt;DOCKER_HOST&lt;/em&gt; set to &lt;strong&gt;tcp://localhost:2375&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SV9WqtJ6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f1dwdxjebmy8j4d108rg.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SV9WqtJ6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f1dwdxjebmy8j4d108rg.png" alt="Add DOCKER_HOST as system variable"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a windows terminal, I can simply run a command like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;docker image ls&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Oyd5SqOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oplxg2wm78f4lg5gevrz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Oyd5SqOM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oplxg2wm78f4lg5gevrz.png" alt="Simple use of docker command"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#in-conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  In conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article shows how we can use docker in windows and WSL2 without Docker Workstation&lt;br&gt;
To do so, we just need first to run a powershell script launching &lt;strong&gt;dockerd&lt;/strong&gt; in WSL2 and once &lt;strong&gt;dockerd&lt;/strong&gt; is listening we can simply use the command &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;/strong&gt; (maintained by Stefan Scherer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes ! We can continue to develop with containers without Docker Workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Fix Clickjacking on NGINX Server in 6 Simple Steps🔥</title>
      <author>Keshav Malik</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 18:49:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/theinfosecguy/how-to-fix-clickjacking-on-nginx-server-in-6-simple-steps-2lbp</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/theinfosecguy/how-to-fix-clickjacking-on-nginx-server-in-6-simple-steps-2lbp</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-is-clickacking"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What is Clickacking?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clickjacking is the practice of tricking a user into clicking on something different from what they think they are clicking on. This often occurs in web browsers, where scripts can be used to make an invisible iframe appear to the user, but the iframe loads a different website than what the user thinks. For example, when a user clicks on a “Like” button, the user might instead unknowingly be liking the attacker’s Facebook profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oRxuFTCV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/epe2fimz7i0pwchqwa1w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oRxuFTCV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/epe2fimz7i0pwchqwa1w.png" alt="Clickjacking"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-fix-clickjacking-on-nginx-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to fix Clickjacking on NGINX server?
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple way to fix Clickjacking Vulnerability, but in this blog post we’ll see how to fix Clickjacking using X-Frame-Options headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-login-to-your-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Login to your server
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, Login to your server using ssh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh root@&amp;lt;&amp;lt;server_ip&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-open-your-nginx-config-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Open your NGINX Config file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make changes in the configuration file, use any text editor to edit the file. I’ll be using vi text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following command to open the text editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now press i to enter into insert mode (Only for vi text editor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-update-the-config-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Update the Config file
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the http block of the config file, add the following code block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add_header X-Frame-Options sameorigin always;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once done, save the config file by pressing ESC key and then type &lt;code&gt;:x&lt;/code&gt; and press enter. (Only for vi text editor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-test-the-config-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Test the Config File
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After saving the configuration file, test the file using following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo nginx -t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the output states not successful, you have probably made some mistake in the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-restart-nginx-server"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Restart NGINX Server
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the result of the above command was successful, you need to restart your server to update the changes that we have made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo service nginx restart&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or use &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl restart nginx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-verify-the-results"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Verify the results
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we are already done with the heavy lifting. It’s time to test if Clickjacking Vulnerability is fixed or not. &lt;a href="https://www.vulnerable.live/clickjacking"&gt;Vulnerable.Live&lt;/a&gt; is an online platform to test for Clickjacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://www.vulnerable.live/clickjacking"&gt;Vulnerable.Live&lt;/a&gt; and Enter your domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B61_MUE3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfk9thrvs0l57uxbrzps.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B61_MUE3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfk9thrvs0l57uxbrzps.png" alt="Vulnerable.Live Dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable.Live helps test for Clickjacking and generate report and POC for the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clickjacking is usually considered as a low hanging fruit but you never know which vulnerability hackers can exploit. Keep your Web Application secure from hackers using &lt;a href="https://www.vulnerable.live"&gt;Vulnerable.Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blockchain 101 (and the protocols that use it)</title>
      <author>Angie Jones</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 18:42:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/techgirl1908/blockchain-101-and-the-protocols-that-use-it-527p</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/techgirl1908/blockchain-101-and-the-protocols-that-use-it-527p</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I'm hearing a lot about crypto, blockchain, bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts, defi (decentralized finance), dapps (decentralized applications), DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), NFTs (non-fungible tokens), web3, and on and on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn more about all of this stuff so I started digging around for tutorials. I found myself pausing each one shortly after starting because they all seemed to assume I had even the slightest clue as to what some of this means. I got particularly confused because they'd call it a beginners guide and yet reference some of the other terms as if I already knew what they meant. Reader, I did not know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/M576WGiDBdQ"&gt;wonderful tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on Free Code Camp. This video tutorial is 16 hours long, so this will probably be a series of blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my notes on the concepts - from an absolute complete beginner's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#whats-the-purpose"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What's the Purpose
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to grasp new concepts when you don't know what they are used for, so let's start here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical currency and the way we spend it is governed by entities such as country leaders, banks, and other financial institutions. A couple of recent cases that come to mind are with Robinhood and OnlyFans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-interactive-brokers-restrict-trading-in-gamestop-s.html"&gt;Robinhood haulted buying of GameStop shares&lt;/a&gt; (at least for some people) after a coordinated effort of Reddit users caused the value of the shares to skyrocket. While Robinhood's move infuriated a lot of people, there wasn't much they could do because Robinhood governs who can buy and sell what on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october"&gt;OnlyFans announced they were banning sexual content&lt;/a&gt; after mounting pressure from payment providers such as Visa and Mastercard. Because of the power of these financial institutions, the company feels forced to play by their rules or lose the ability to accept these forms of payments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been many instances where banks prevent withdrawing your own money for various reasons, or hold deposits before allowing you access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decentralized network that is not controlled by individual entities addresses these concerns. With decentralized networks, we get transparency, freedom, and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#blockchain"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Blockchain
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starting point is blockchain - a type of database that stores information in individual blocks that are chained together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is shared across many computers (known as nodes), so there's no single record, but rather multiple copies of the record - making it almost impossible to hack. All of these records are visible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional databases, blocks within the blockchain are immutable, which means they cannot be changed. So when something is written onto the blockchain, it serves as a permanent record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When new data needs to be added to the blockchain, it must be written in a new block and then chained together to the last block. The blocks are in sequential order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because blockchain is decentralized, there is no central governance controlling what can and cannot occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bitcoin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bitcoin
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is one of the first protocols to use blockchain. It is a cryptocurrency (I'm thinking of it as "digital money") used in peer to peer transactions in a decentralized network to buy and sell things. Records of all of these transactions are stored on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just because it's digital doesn't mean there's an infinite amount of it. There is a finite amount of bitcoin, just like with physical money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#ethereum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Ethereum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is another blockchain protocol. The cryptocurrency of this protocol is called Ether (ETH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum takes its use of blockchain a step further than bitcoin. With Ethereum, you're not just limited to decentralized currency, but it enables people to build decentralized applications (also known as dapps) and decentralized organizations (also known as DAOs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is not the only advanced protocol utilizing blockchain, but it is by far the most popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"&gt;turing-complete&lt;/a&gt; which means we can also program anything with it! These programs are known as  smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#smart-contracts"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Smart Contracts
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts are code that describe an agreement between parties and executes the terms of that agreement on its own. Smart contracts execute on a blockchain. On Ethereum, smart contracts are coded in the &lt;a href="https://soliditylang.org/"&gt;Solidity programming language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's great about smart contracts is that trust between parties is not required. The terms and conditions are coded and automatically executed, so you don't have to worry about the other party (e.g., insurance company) not holding up their end of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the main advantages of the Ethereum protocol over the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin also has smart contracts, however, by design, they are not turing-complete - meaning they aren't capable of the wide range of functionality possible with Ethereum. Bitcoin is viewed more as an asset whereas Ethereum is an asset as well as a platform to build smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens in blockchain stays in blockchain (this concept is also known as on-chain), which poses a problem for smart contracts that need to access outside data or computations. Blockchain Oracles solve this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracles are able to perform computations and provide information to smart contracts on the blockchain. But because oracles are external to the blockchain, we need to make sure the data they are providing is decentralized before sending it to the blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network (the most popular one) that will facilitate the transfer of the external data onto the blockchain, ensuring that it is clean. Smart contracts that use external data are technically known as hybrid smart contracts, but this term is interchangeable with smart contracts. If someone explicitly says "hybrid smart contract" they are intentionally pointing out the fact that external data (off-chain) was used. Chainlink can be used with any of the blockchain and smart contract platforms, not just Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dapps are decentralized applications that typically comprise of multiple smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that's what I know for now. Stay tuned as I learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 5 IntelliJ IDEA Tips &amp; Tricks!</title>
      <author>Will BL</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 18:16:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/williambl/top-5-intellij-idea-tips-tricks-3cid</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/williambl/top-5-intellij-idea-tips-tricks-3cid</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent all-rounder IDE by Jetbrains. It's most often used for Java and Kotlin, but can also be used to develop for JS, Rust, and many more languages. It's what I use for most of my programming, and so I thought I'd share what config tweaks, tricks, and plugins I've used that make it nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#darcula-make-it-darker"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Darcula? Make it darker!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmP1q1Cx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jhe73qmxss6olwwyjcao.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AmP1q1Cx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jhe73qmxss6olwwyjcao.png" alt="An IntelliJ window with Darcula Darker theme"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darcula is a very nice theme, but it always bugged me that it wasn't nearly as dark as the light theme is light. It felt like there was more potential there. &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12692-darcula-darker-theme"&gt;Darcula Darker, by Vecheslav Druzhbin&lt;/a&gt;, darkens backgrounds, contrasting it more against text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#rainbow-brackets"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Rainbow Brackets
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kdFh5IBi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j7b89ucycppjlpasvcts.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kdFh5IBi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j7b89ucycppjlpasvcts.png" alt="An example of rainbow brackets"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets"&gt;This plugin&lt;/a&gt; may sound silly at first, but rainbow brackets honestly vastly improves readability of nested brackets. It works by giving each pair of brackets its own colour, so that nested sets are visually distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we're on the rainbow topic, for those who work with CSV files often, &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12896-rainbow-csv"&gt;Rainbow CSV&lt;/a&gt; may be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#errors-should-be-visible"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Errors should be visible!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8vclOspM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3ibfwi8pgxur0znmngp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8vclOspM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3ibfwi8pgxur0znmngp.png" alt="Code with an error highlighted in red"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in very dense code, it can be difficult to find a single-character syntax error at a glance, as its signified by a tiny red squiggly line. How do you fix that, and make it stand out? Add a red highlight, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This can be done by going into Settings -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; Color Scheme -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Errors and Warnings -&amp;gt; Error and setting Background to #630202)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#comments-are-for-humans"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Comments are for humans
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v9cBJoua--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gcfufg9d2jjw724bzdw1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v9cBJoua--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gcfufg9d2jjw724bzdw1.png" alt="Some code with bright pink comments"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I will never understand is that comments, despite being more for humans' benefit than &lt;em&gt;the rest of the code&lt;/em&gt;, are always put in low-contrast greys, as if the machine, envious that it cannot read them, doesn't want me to be able to either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make your comments bright pink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This can be done by going into Settings -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; Color Scheme -&amp;gt; Language Defaults -&amp;gt; Block Comment + Line Comment and setting Foreground to #FC7CE1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#nyanyanyanyanya-or-is-it-nyannyannyan"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  nya-nya-nya-nya-nya (or is it nyan-nyan-nyan?)
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vKz3jndd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sds8n1iwx1lidijqk5le.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vKz3jndd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sds8n1iwx1lidijqk5le.png" alt="A nyan cat progress bar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have any reason for &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; other than that it makes me smile. But do I really need another reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href="#more"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  More!
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have yet more &lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt; on how to get the most out of your editor - follow me to get notified when part two of this series is out! You'll get to learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we discuss this question, let us recap what the Behavioral Interview Round at Facebook is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral Interview Round is also known as the Jedi Interview round at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is about you and your history, your résumé, and your motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this interview is to assess whether the candidate will thrive in Facebook's peer-to-peer, minimal process, and unstructured engineering organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Software Engineers, the behavioral interview is actually part behavioral and part coding. The coding part is a shorter version of the usual coding interviews and is included to supplement the other two coding interviews to get an additional coding signal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tips &amp;amp; Tricks to effectively prepare for Behavioral Interviews
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_kgnGQmN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4y9t832s7yc0j58aycqb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_kgnGQmN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4y9t832s7yc0j58aycqb.png" alt="Tips &amp;amp; Tricks to effectively prepare for Behavioral Interviews" title="Behavioral Interview Tips &amp;amp; Tricks"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know yourself! Take the time to review your résumé, as the interviewer will almost certainly ask about key events in your work history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have concrete examples or anecdotes to support each of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with Facebook's mission statement and its five core values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Bold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on Impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move Fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Social Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be yourself! Be open and honest about your successes and failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be humble and focus on teamwork, leadership, and mentorship qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us review how to effectively answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;

  Question: Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5UJnKxwyg&amp;amp;t=452s"&gt;Video Explanation&lt;/a&gt; with Evaluation Criteria, Response Framework, Tips &amp;amp; Tricks, Sample Answer (Example), and a Special Case of "Never worked with a difficult person".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person" is one of the most frequent questions asked in behavioral interviews. Interviewers sometimes phrase this question as "Tell me about a time you worked with someone challenging".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#evaluation-criteria"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Evaluation Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rktvsb4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zzt6w0jikazap38ea4g8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Rktvsb4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zzt6w0jikazap38ea4g8.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzrIIWRI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ubiny7f8s4c1qmejre3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nzrIIWRI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8ubiny7f8s4c1qmejre3.png" alt="Evaluation Criteria for Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Evaluation Criteria for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, in every workplace, you will face a situation where you have to work with a colleague who has a difficult personality. By asking this question, the interviewer's goal is to assess how you work in difficult situations or unstructured environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are trying to judge your:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maturity level,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication skills, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willingness to speak up irrespective of your coworkers' seniority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also evaluating whether you are empathetic and respectful towards your colleagues while understanding your coworker's motivations and viewpoints behind the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A crucial element to this question is that the interviewer is looking for a positive resolution of the conflict that benefits the company and not just an individual. They are trying to see if you are flexible to compromise and open to learning from challenging experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#response-framework"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Response Framework
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nSH4xQoo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuistwhyp13ozqg8yhdv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--nSH4xQoo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uuistwhyp13ozqg8yhdv.png" alt="Response Framework for Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Response Framework for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our advice is to pick a compelling and honest story that can articulate an actual situation where you had to work with a colleague who had a difficult personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe the situation, events that occurred, and explain what led to the conflict between you and your colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be due to lack of communication and difference of opinions over a project design, code review, or some other disagreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present both sides of the arguments in a positive and empathetic way. This will help you to come across as level-headed and professional. It will demonstrate that you take time to understand other people's perspectives and are not narrow-minded when working with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explain the exact steps you took to address the challenging situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be a one-on-one discussion with your colleague, doing more research, creating an updated plan of action, or pair programming with your coworker to come to a resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will demonstrate your ownership and problem-solving skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will give the interviewer an inside look at how well you work in an unstructured environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, show that you proactively communicated the issue and its resolution to all the stakeholders to keep them well informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Express how the outcome was beneficial to the project and the company and not just to you and your coworker. Finally, explain the learnings you took from the conflict and how they helped you to avoid similar disagreements from happening again in the future and to become a better engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tips-amp-tricks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Tips &amp;amp; Tricks
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rgImFwGr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c58nemm4bnbmu1t5hbpx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rgImFwGr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c58nemm4bnbmu1t5hbpx.png" alt="Tips and Tricks for Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Tips &amp;amp; Tricks for 'Tell Me About A Time You Worked With A Difficult Person'"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips and tricks that will help you effectively prepare this question for the behavioral interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remain calm and professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refrain from being negative and avoid blaming your employer, coworkers, or manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies generally do not like to hire people who are always pointing fingers at others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a compelling story that is honest and believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick an example involving a business issue and avoid personal disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calmly explain both sides' points of view and show how a complete understanding or a compromise led to a better outcome for the company and not just an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not sugarcoat your answer with irrelevant details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time talking about the resolution than the conflict and mention the learnings that will help you avoid the same disagreements from happening again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show that you proactively communicated the issue and its resolution to all the stakeholders to keep them well informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare the response for this question beforehand, as it will be tough to structure your answer on the spot during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not memorize the answer as it should come naturally, and you should sound confident to the interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sample-answer-example"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Sample Answer (Example)
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Rachel. She is currently working as a Software Engineer at a major internet company. She is interviewing for the role of Senior Software Engineer at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎧 Listen to her response to this question in this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr5UJnKxwyg&amp;amp;t=690s"&gt;YouTube Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#special-case-never-worked-with-a-difficult-person"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Special Case: Never Worked With A Difficult Person
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CfWE9d9P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/insqlqn81sw6e0fs5cir.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--CfWE9d9P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/insqlqn81sw6e0fs5cir.png" alt="Special Case: Never Worked With A Difficult Person" title="Special Case: Never Worked With A Difficult Person"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be the case that you actually never worked with a difficult person so far in your career. New Grads and entry-level software engineers usually fall under this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in such a situation, do not end your answer by simply saying that you never worked with a difficult person in your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, provide your interviewer with a hypothetical situation and walk through how you would respond and modify your course of action in such a situation just as you would for a real past experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help the interviewer evaluate you on the following attributes mentioned earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How well you can handle a conflict,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in ambiguous situations, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're open-minded and flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How fast your code is?</title>
      <author>101samovar</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 17:57:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/101samovar/how-fast-your-code-is-10lf</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/101samovar/how-fast-your-code-is-10lf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two code snippets that do the same thing.&lt;br&gt;
How to check which one is faster?&lt;br&gt;
Let we have an array of numbers.&lt;br&gt;
And we have to do mathematical evaluation for each item.&lt;br&gt;
There is more than one way to do it.&lt;br&gt;
One way is to use a map method and an arrow function.&lt;br&gt;
The other way is to use a for loop and a push method.&lt;br&gt;
So we have two code snippets for one task.&lt;br&gt;
Which one is faster?&lt;br&gt;
Let’s define the benchmark function.&lt;br&gt;
Function has one parameter: code snippet. &lt;br&gt;
In that function we will repeat code snippet execution multiple times.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const snippetA = () =&amp;gt; {array.map(x =&amp;gt; Math.sin(x))};
const snippetB = () =&amp;gt; {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; array.length; i++) {
        result.push(Math.sin(array[i]));
    }
    return result;
};

const benchmark = snippet =&amp;gt; {
    const count = 1000000;
    let start = new Date();
    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; count; i++) {
        snippet();
    }
    return new Date() - start;
};

console.log('map: ', benchmark(snippetA));
console.log('for: ', benchmark(snippetB));

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we check how much time it requires.&lt;br&gt;
The less time period the faster the code snippet.&lt;br&gt;
OK.&lt;br&gt;
Let’s check it out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WxAcCps9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jgysn5mpt9oh0uy8puan.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--WxAcCps9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jgysn5mpt9oh0uy8puan.PNG" alt="101samovar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The snippet  A with a map method.&lt;br&gt;
And  the snippet B with a for loop.&lt;br&gt;
The snippet B  has required less time.&lt;br&gt;
The for snippet  is faster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Add Some Bounce to your Forms with Animated Floating Labels</title>
      <author>Diana Le</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 17:11:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/dianale_dev/add-some-bounce-to-your-forms-with-floating-labels-44</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/dianale_dev/add-some-bounce-to-your-forms-with-floating-labels-44</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#how-to-style-form-labels-like-placeholders"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  How to Style Form Labels like Placeholders
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; Forms with labels directly on top of the inputs have always looked perfectly fine to me. I never understood the movement a few years ago to design forms without labels. You can fit a lot more useful text above the input than trying to cram all it in as a placeholder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, there may be times when it makes sense to style forms this way, so I decided to revisit these label/input combinations for Codepen's weekly challenge "Lightness", while also making sure to keep these components accessible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/pursuitofleisure/embed/oNwPdma?height=600&amp;amp;default-tab=result&amp;amp;embed-version=2"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These "floating" labels are not new, and here they're styled to be more bouncy than you'd probably want to use on most of your sites. But the structure is what's important here as the CSS can always be tweaked. So let's make sure to make these as accessible as possible following some of the tips outlined in this &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/"&gt;Smashing Magazine article&lt;/a&gt; about the cons of using placeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-the-raw-ltlabelgt-endraw-tags"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Tags
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example is not even using placeholders at all. Instead the label tag has been styled to sit inside the input tag, so it can keep the relevant HTML connection to the input.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"form-input"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;for=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"firstName"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;First Name&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"text"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"firstName"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"firstName"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;autocomplete=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"given-name"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#keep-the-labels-during-and-after-the-user-has-filled-in-their-information"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Keep the Labels during and after the User has Filled in their Information
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where JavaScript is necessary. You can style the labels to rise and float above the field when the input is focused with CSS, but we need to keep the labels after users have finished and focused out of the input so it's easier for them to review their information. If you use placeholders, the useful text will disappear once the input is filled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user clicks into the input, I'm adding a class of "floating," and keeping the label there permanently unless the user doesn't fill out the input, in which case it returns to its original location.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Add floating class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;floatLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;floating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Only remove floating class if there is no text in the input&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;checkInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;currentTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parentElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;floating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#conclusion"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started doing web development I was concerned with just making sure elements were styled like the design - which is challenging in itself, especially with form elements - but now I'm paying more attention to the structure to make sure that I'm not making it more difficult for people to use my sites because of the way they're styled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Cron keep your eyes in check</title>
      <author>has12zen</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 16:42:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/has12zen/using-cron-keep-your-eyes-in-check-k83</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/has12zen/using-cron-keep-your-eyes-in-check-k83</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#basic-syntax-for-cron"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  basic syntax for cron
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a typical cron job looks like this&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# m h  dom mon dow   command
  * *   *   *   *   /usr/bin/sh ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stand for wildcard
this is not a cron tutorial this is just how i use it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#eyessh-script"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  eyes.sh script
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the bash script looks like&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY=:0
notify-send "EYES CHECK" "Look away for 15 seconds"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;without line no 2 it wont work as it sets the display for notify-send. I am using notify-send as my notification daemon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;make sure that your display is :0 &lt;br&gt;
you can do this with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $DISPLAY
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#setting-up-crontab"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  setting up crontab
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first you will need to make sure cron is running you can do this  by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl status cronie
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;p.s. this is specific to arch based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;once cron is running you can create/edit cron job with &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then paste the code present below into the window.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/sh  /home/elnovo/.noti/eyes.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;it runs every 15 min and eyes.sh is the bash script we discussed above. save it. &lt;br&gt;
you can find the cron jobs currently present by &lt;code&gt;crontab -l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#sources"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  sources
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/298608/notify-send-doesnt-work-from-crontab"&gt;notify-send doesn't work from crontab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An extensible React "Plug &amp; Play" Widget</title>
      <author>Mike Talbot</author>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 16:35:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/miketalbot/react-plug-play-widget-ui-2mg4</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/miketalbot/react-plug-play-widget-ui-2mg4</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#tldr"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  TLDR;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm building a blogging widget that allows authors to further engage their audience by creating interactive and gamified experiences right within their post.  This article is part of a series that looks at how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll look at how the Widget allows extension functionality to be created by authors so that they can add their own interactive, configurable extensions and we can build a library of useful tools anyone can use!  The extension functionality works without having to access the core project and can be easily developed and deployed using any framework that can output Javascript and interact with the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#motivation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Motivation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm building the interactive widget below, vote on what you'd like to interact with or embed in your own post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/n4dpo?initialpath=/WqyJ3-ZdFz0jrqSOQw2IT/embed&amp;amp;runonclick=0"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#requirements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Requirements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key principle here is to create an API that can be used to easily add an extension to the widget so that an author can create powerful new functionality to "plug in".  I don't want to enforce a technology stack choice on the developer so they should be able to write in anything from vanilla Javascript to a fully fledged framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developer needs to build two things, an &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; component that will allow a post author to configure the extension widget and a &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt; that will be rendered inside the post and perform whatever actions are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key features need to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and expose an API that allows a developer to register an extension for both &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt; concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expose an API that allows a plugin developer to record information relevant to the reader, the article and the widget (for example a vote in a poll)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a way of notifying the plugin developer about existing responses related to the article and changes to the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an API to allow the plugin developer to award points and badges to the reader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide a way for the plugin developer to have their extension code loaded when the plugin is to be used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#configuration-interface"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Configuration Interface
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've built a configuration interface for the main Widget that allows the injection of the custom &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; instances and saves all of the necessary data.  To configure a widget the user works with a number of screens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--djOKQ-Je--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ojbgs3wjx0datbtw65f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--djOKQ-Je--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5ojbgs3wjx0datbtw65f.png" alt="Author Home page"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homepage gives an author access to their profile, their articles and their comments.  Each article or comment has a configuration for the widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mn0eqv86--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jm0irecyfew4y37hm3mb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mn0eqv86--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jm0irecyfew4y37hm3mb.png" alt="Author article list"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author makes an entry for each post and can use the summary view to see how many times the content has been viewed (including unique user views) and the number of times it has been interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fWbCfEU3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ype9r8809mtml1ug5o5w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fWbCfEU3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ype9r8809mtml1ug5o5w.png" alt="Widget configuration"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author can configure the main and footer widgets for their embed.  They choose an available widget from a drop down list and its editor is displayed in line (here the example is for the simple HTML plugin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PXoUCpPj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/viucrt4s6kqikv3lhvwp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PXoUCpPj--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/viucrt4s6kqikv3lhvwp.png" alt="Additional plugin configuration"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the widget is a custom built one then they can specify the files it should load on the "Advanced" tab.  The entries here are for all of the Javascript files to load - while developing these could be hosted on a local development server or it could be hosted on GitHub or anywhere else, so long as the files are served as Javascript and not text.  Many build systems output more than one file for inclusion in the core package (for instance a vendors file and a main source bundle) and they can all be listed here or the urls included in a &lt;code&gt;.bundle&lt;/code&gt; file that is then used here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#runtime-script-loading"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Runtime Script Loading
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so to start with the system needs to load the extension code specified in the "Advanced" tab.  It does this by splitting the list of files on &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; and then checking if the file is one of three types (+ 1 filter):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A .editor.* file - which will only be loaded if the widget is in the configuration system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A .js file - in which case a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is created and the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; set to be the file. This means the file must be served with the correct mime type (which GitHub raw files are not, unless you use a CDN extension which will cache the file, making it unwise during development).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A .jsx or a .babel.js file - in which case browser babel is loaded and then an additional &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag with a type of &lt;code&gt;text/babel&lt;/code&gt; is created with the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; attribute set to the file and an environment of &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;react&lt;/code&gt; added to it.  This allows lightweight React plugins as React is used to build the outer layer.  It's a big fancy, and I won't go into too much more detail here apart from to say, that if one .jsx file imports another then it also needs to be specified here. &lt;em&gt;Note that GitHub raw files are fine in this case&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A .bundle file - in which case the file is downloaded and the same process is applied to the contents of the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that plugins will be developed as bundled projects if using a framework and the output Javascript included.  I've tested it with Webpack and Rollup, you just need to be sure to include all of the files that would have been included in the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;babelUrl&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;onload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nx"&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a custom hook to load the plugins and ensure the babel is transpiled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;usePlugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;definition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;definition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setTimeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;definition&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hadBabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`script[src~="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"]`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;continue&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.babel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.jsx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;hadBabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;text/babel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loadBabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;src&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;data-presets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;env,react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hadBabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;dispatchEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;DOMContentLoaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;deps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#registering-new-plugins"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Registering New Plugins
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading the code is one thing, but once loaded it needs to be able to interact with the outer widget.  To accomplish this the outer widget exposes an API on &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; in a variable called &lt;code&gt;Framework4C&lt;/code&gt;.  This API provides all of the core functions required by a plugin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Framework4C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Accessibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;reduceMotion&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//User prefers reduced motion&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The whole of Material UI core&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;showNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A function to show a toast&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// A material UI theme&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// React 17&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ReactDOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ReactDOM 17&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Function to register plugins&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Interaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;awardPoints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;respond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;respondUnique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addAchievement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Response functions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To get involved in the process the only thing that the newly loaded code needs to do is to call &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; passing a valid &lt;code&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/code&gt; value and a function that will render the &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt; within a specified parent DOM element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9C2WBX5C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pnjijavc50my8tuxrro5.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9C2WBX5C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pnjijavc50my8tuxrro5.jpg" alt="Widget Types"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#registering-a-plugin"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Registering A Plugin
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each plugin comprises an &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-editor"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Editor
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An editor is provided with a place to store configuration data and a function to call to say that the data has been changed. It is the job of the editor to set up any parameters that the runtime will need - these are all entirely at the discretion of the developer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="na"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Framework4C&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MAIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Remote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Ignore Runtime */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* Render the editor underneath parent */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you were going to use React to render the editor you'd use ReactDOM.render passing the parent element.  If you were using Vue you'd &lt;code&gt;createApp&lt;/code&gt; and mount it inside the parent:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createApp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./App.vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./Render.vue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Framework4C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;MAIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Vue Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;onChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To register an editor we simply call the &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; function, specifying the type of plugin and pass a callback for when it is time to render the plugin's editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#poll-editor-ui"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Poll Editor UI
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of the UI for the editor that made the poll on the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AnCz3zk_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g10hd04evezzuxpqnnol.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AnCz3zk_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g10hd04evezzuxpqnnol.png" alt="Poll Editor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Poll Editor Code
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;ButtonGroup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;CardContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;indexOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#the-runtime"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The Runtime
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runtime is used to render the component when it is viewed by a reader, presumably it takes the configuration information provided by the author and uses that to create the desired user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runtime is also supplied a parent DOM element, but it is also supplied with the &lt;code&gt;settings&lt;/code&gt; made in the editor, the &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; that is being viewed, the current &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; object that contains all of the responses.  This response object may be updated after the initial render and a &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; event of &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; is raised passing the updated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
  &lt;a href="#implementation"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Implementation
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the framework is concerned, the &lt;code&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; function just records the callback for the &lt;em&gt;editor&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;runtime&lt;/em&gt; in a data structure and raises a change event.  These entries are looked up for rendering.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;./raise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;MAIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;FOOTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;footer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;NOTIFICATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;FOOTER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;NOTIFICATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;existing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;existing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="na"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;existing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;plugins-updated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#runtime-responses"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Runtime Responses
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin system gives you the ability to capture responses from the user and store them. All of the responses for the current article are provided to you, so for instance you can show the results of a poll or a quiz.  Using these methods you can record information and display it to the reader in the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system also raises events on window when the response changes so you can show real-time updates as data changes due to any current readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common way to capture a users response is to use the API call &lt;code&gt;respondUnique(articleId, type, response)&lt;/code&gt;.  This API call will record a response object unique to the current user.  The &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; parameter is an arbitrary string you use to differentiate your plugins response from others.  The &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; passed is an object or value that will be recorded for the user and then made available to all plugin instances for the current article. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; object populated due to a call passing “MyResponseType” as the type might look like this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;MyReponseType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="na"&gt;UserId1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* something you recorded */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="na"&gt;UserId2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* something you recorded for user 2 */&lt;/span&gt;     
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So to display summaries or totals for a poll or a quiz you would calculate them by iterating over the unique user responses and calculating the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you call &lt;code&gt;respondUnique&lt;/code&gt; multiple times, only the last value will be recorded for the current user, this is normally what you want for a poll or a quiz.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;respondUnique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;uid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may also call &lt;code&gt;respond&lt;/code&gt; with the same parameters.  In this case, the &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; structure will contain an array of all of the responses for each user.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="nl"&gt;MyReponseType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="na"&gt;UserId1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* something you recorded */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* another thing */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}],&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class="na"&gt;UserId2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* something you recorded for user 2 */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;     
   &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#runtime-rendering"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Runtime Rendering
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runtime rendering of the whole widget relies on calling the registered functions.  The Widget builds a container DOM structure and then calls a function called &lt;code&gt;renderPlugin&lt;/code&gt; passing in the settings.  I'll put the whole code for this in a foldaway so you can examine it if you like, we'll concentrate on &lt;code&gt;renderPlugin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;renderPlugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pluginName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previewMode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pluginName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;pluginName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;pluginName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;previewMode&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rendering the plugin is simply a matter of looking up the plugin required in the registered list and then calling its runtime function.  The outer holder handles monitoring Firestore for changes to the response information and raising the custom event should it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  renderWidget
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;addAchievement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/firebase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../assets/4C_logo.jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;PluginTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/raise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;../lib/merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;notLoaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;lastMain&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;renderWidget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;isAnonymous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useArticle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;definitionRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;articles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
