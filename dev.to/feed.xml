      <title>The Better Way of Sending Data to the Backend</title>

      <guid>https://dev.to/manas_dev/the-better-way-of-sending-data-to-the-backend-bdp</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a front-end developer, who ever worked on picture uploading, video uploading or audio uploading to the backend, then you should know that uploaind these types of data is a slow process, and it even becomes laggy when a large data is being upload at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we want to upload a picture or audio to the backend, we can't just send it to the backend in their original format. Every picture or audio, has a binary format, which is first being converted to base64 format in the frontend, which is then being sent to the backend, and if you want to get the data again from the backend, then you can't show it on the frontend, in their base64 format, which means that with every GET request, the backend have to convert the data from the base64 to the binary, and then it perfomrs GET request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can cleary see, that it's a two time conversion. First from binary data to base64 data and then again from base64 to binary data, and eventually this process takes large data to upload slowly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there's always a solution. What we have to do instead of converting it to base64 in the frontend, is sending binary data directly to the backend, which means that even backend don't have to convert it in any way, which makes the process fast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, now the question is that how to do that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;FormData()&lt;/code&gt; constructor to send binary data directly to the backend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, you have to create an instance of the formdata.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;formData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and then you have to append the data to the formData.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;formData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Chris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let's take an example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendAudioAsync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioChapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioBookId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Uploading audio &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;FormData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioChapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioChapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioChapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;audio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioChapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;audioChapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;sendingAudio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above example is the real time example of the client I am working for, in which I have to send audio and its detail to the backend, and I used &lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt; to send it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FormData is always in key value pair, and you have to put a name and the data as key value pair, if using FormData to send binary data directly to the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Day 73 of 100 Days of Code &amp; Scrum: Project Page for My Portfolio</title>
      <author>Rammina</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/rammina/day-73-of-100-days-of-code-scrum-project-page-for-my-portfolio-30hf</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I finished adding individual pages for my projects, such as my &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com/portfolio/amussement"&gt;chat application&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rammina.com/portfolio/daily-quest"&gt;to-do-list&lt;/a&gt;. While they look decent enough, they could still use some improvements. One feature I would like to implement at some point is an image carousel, as that would look much more professional than just lining up images vertically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yt5mLMLn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641618887074/vGcJrW7qE.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--yt5mLMLn--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641618887074/vGcJrW7qE.png" alt="Rammina Amussement Page" width="880" height="465"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b3WlrJ7v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641618952827/ufLH2NYCF.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--b3WlrJ7v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641618952827/ufLH2NYCF.png" alt="Rammina Daily Quest Page" width="880" height="466"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also started working on individual services pages for Web Development, Digital Marketing, and Writing. Currently, I am not sure what content I will put inside these pages and how to lay everything out that would convert a visitor to a customer. It might take me some time to come up with a final design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#yesterday"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Yesterday
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished the mobile and desktop designs for my specific portfolio project page component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read an article about Scrum, specifically, an example of a great facilitator and coach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also watched a video from Ahrefs about Domain Authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#today"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Today
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#company-website"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Company Website
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished creating project detail pages for my chat application and to-do-list app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add boilerplate for individual services pages (WIP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#scrum"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Scrum
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read this Scrum article, &lt;a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/typical-sprint-play-play"&gt;Typical Sprint: Play-by-play | Scrum.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's not really anything groundbreaking, and the stuff I've read were already in the &lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html"&gt;2020 Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt;, but I appreciate the extra examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading! Have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Download / stream large file with :hackney in Elixir</title>
      <author>Dung Nguyen</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 05:05:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/onpointvn/download-stream-large-file-with-hackney-in-elixir-539m</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/onpointvn/download-stream-large-file-with-hackney-in-elixir-539m</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my project, I have a quite large csv file for seeding my database. Put it is project source code increasing size of docker image but that file only run once. So I decide to upload to S3 and stream/download to server and then run seeding code. In this post I will show you how I do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found some post which stream file using HTTPoison library but in some case I don't want to add more dependencies so I write my own module, and I think it's a good way to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#what-you-will-learn"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  What you will learn
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will learn 2 cool function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Stream.resource&lt;/code&gt; to build a new stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And &lt;code&gt;:hackney.stream_body&lt;/code&gt; to read chunk of data from remote file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#1-build-the-stream"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  1. Build the stream
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;Stream.resource&lt;/code&gt;, read full document &lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#resource/3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this function receives 3 function as arguments: one function to setup stream, one for build data stream, and one for handle stream completion. This example from the &lt;code&gt;hexdocs.pm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sample"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is_binary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:halt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisrt function open the file and its result is passed as argument for second function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second function read data line by line until the end of file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third function handle close file handler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For downloading file, we do similar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream parts of file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close connection
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;begin_download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;continue_download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;finish_download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#2-open-connection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  2. Open connection
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;begin_download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:hackney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;%{})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Content-Length"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 0 is current downloaded size&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;:hackney.get&lt;/code&gt; to open connection to server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract content length from header, this is useful to verify length later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return tuple of &lt;code&gt;{client, total_size, current_download_size}&lt;/code&gt; these data would be used to stream content in the next function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#3-stream-chunks"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  3. Stream chunks
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;continue_download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:hackney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# update downloaded size&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;byte_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# no more data, tell stream to close&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and move to function 3&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:halt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;reason&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we use &lt;code&gt;:hackney.stream_body&lt;/code&gt; to read data from connection chunk by chunk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#4-close-connection"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  4. Close connection
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;defp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;finish_download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:hackney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="no"&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Complete download &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; / &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;total_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; bytes"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we simply close the connection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#5-save-to-the-file"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  5. Save to the file
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above steps, we build a stream of data, now we save it to a file&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;download&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;save_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stream!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember to invoke &lt;code&gt;Stream.run&lt;/code&gt; to actually run the stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#6-stream-by-line"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  6. Stream by line
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we don't want to store file on our server because we only use it once. So we stream and process file content on the fly. We use &lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt; library to decode csv content because it supports stream but it only accepts stream of lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we transform stream of chunk to stream of line&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight elixir"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# to known when the stream end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="n"&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;last_line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="no"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="no"&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;last_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Storing User Preferences in React</title>
      <author>lrth06</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 04:18:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/lrth06/storing-user-preferences-in-react-2g4i</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/lrth06/storing-user-preferences-in-react-2g4i</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial was originally posted &lt;a href="https://tobyhagan.com/blog/storing-user-preferences-in-react"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#allowing-users-to-select-preferences-is-great-if-they-stick-around"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Allowing users to select preferences is great, if they stick around...
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preferences, that is. User retention is an entirely different conversation. But as far as persisting a user's data goes, the approach is surprisingly straight forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#be-safe"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Be Safe
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When storing a user's data, it is important to keep security in mind. Don't save things like a user's password or a secret key where unwanted intrusions may occur. For the purposes of this demonstration, we will only be storing the user's theme preference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#getting-started"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Getting Started
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://tobyhagan.com/blog/dark-mode-using-react"&gt;last tutorial&lt;/a&gt; we learned how to create a dark mode toggle button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;./App.css&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;react&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Dark Mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Light Mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/h1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;

        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;dark-mode-slider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/App.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.dark-mode-slider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;30px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;border-radius&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;#2e3440&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;relative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0.2s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nc"&gt;.dark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;.dark-mode-slider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nl"&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;45px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#where-did-it-go"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Where did it go?
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets take a closer look at our functionality. When we click the button, our styling toggles between light and dark mode, awesome! If you switch to dark mode and refresh, you may notice you're right back to light mode, as that is our default setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#making-it-stick"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Making it stick
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets fix this behavior by storing our preference using the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API"&gt;localStorage api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll need to update our &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook from it's current state:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;to the following:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight jsx"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;prefersDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;prefersDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;classList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;darkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this change, we've told our application to store a key value pair to our browser, but you may have noticed we are only setting the item and not using it to control our state. To accomplish this, we need to add another &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook above the one we just edited, it should look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storedPreference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;darkModePreference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;storedPreference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;storedPreference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lets take a closer look. We are using the &lt;code&gt;getItem&lt;/code&gt; method to retrieve the value of the key we set earlier, and using the &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/code&gt; method to convert the string value to a &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean"&gt;boolean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
We're leaving the dependency array empty, because we only want this to run on the initial mount of our application. With this change complete, we are now able to refresh our page, and our theme preference is loaded without us having to toggle the button.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="#saving-some-time"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Saving some time
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, users will already have certain preferences available from their device, and we can use those to set our initial state. In this case, we can use the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia"&gt;matchMedia api&lt;/a&gt; to check if the user has a  theme preference set in their device.To accomplish this, we can edit the previous &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook to look like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;storedPreference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;darkModePreference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;storedPreference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;storedPreference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;prefersDarkMode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matchMedia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nx"&gt;setDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;prefersDarkMode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We're using an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement to check if the user has a preference set in their device. If they do, we'll set the state to the value of the preference. If not, we'll use the &lt;code&gt;matchMedia&lt;/code&gt; api to check if the user prefers dark mode. If they do, we'll set the state to using the &lt;code&gt;prefers-color-scheme: dark&lt;/code&gt; media query. This will return a boolean value, and we'll set &lt;code&gt;prefersDarkMode&lt;/code&gt; to that value. This will trigger our initial &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; hook to run, and update our application to match the user's preference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all it takes to persist data in the browser. This was just a small example, but many developers find this useful for storing a multitude of non-sensitive data, without having to make expensive calls to the server among many other creative uses.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;we talk about web rtc communication to like video&lt;br&gt;
 calling web application, audio calling application using simple peer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;npm install simple-peer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;simple peer library directly communicate with browser without any extra library or api.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#serverjs"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  server.js
&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;io.on('connection', function(socket){
  debug('a user connected');

  io.emit('peer', {
    peerId: socket.id
  })

  socket.on('disconnect', reason =&amp;gt; {
    io.emit('unpeer', {
      peerId: socket.id,
      reason
    })
  })

  socket.on('signal', msg =&amp;gt; {
    debug('signal received', msg)
    const receiverId = msg.to
    const receiver = io.sockets.connected[receiverId]
    if (receiver) {
      const data = {
        from: socket.id,
        ...msg
      }
      debug('sending signal to', receiverId)
      io.to(receiverId).emit('signal', data);
    } else {

  })

});

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>How I made Instagram Content Fetching API in Node.js </title>
      <author>Sahil Verma</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 03:30:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/theviralboy/how-i-made-instagram-content-fetching-api-in-nodejs-2ml6</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/theviralboy/how-i-made-instagram-content-fetching-api-in-nodejs-2ml6</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub Repo : &lt;a href="https://github.com/theviralboy/instagram-api"&gt;instagram-api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was planning to build an Instagram downloading website. That's I was researching about this on Google, then I found this amazing trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put &lt;strong&gt;?__a=1&lt;/strong&gt; after any Instagram link then it'll give a JSON in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Instagram post&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/{post_id}/?__a=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Instagram user profile&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/{profile_username}/?__a=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you try to fetch this API inside your code then, you'll get a CORS error like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7AEHThcq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x5edrv9sm1zg7usb3rpy.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7AEHThcq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/x5edrv9sm1zg7usb3rpy.png" alt="cors error" width="880" height="211"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To overcome this problem we have to use our server. So let's start building a node server for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make a new folder and open that folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;instagram-api
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;instagram-api
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then initialize a node project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm init &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now install the following dependencies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i request express
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make a new JavaScript file.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;touch &lt;/span&gt;index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open VS Code in this folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;code .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modify your &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1",
},

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon index.js" // you must have to install nodemon globally by npm install -g nodemon
},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file in VS Code and import all dependencies.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const express = require("express");
const request = require("request");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now start listening to the port you want to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const express = require("express");
const request = require("request");

const PORT = 1234;

const app = express();
app.listen(PORT, () =&amp;gt; {
  console.clear();
  console.log(`listing in http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can start the server to see the results side by side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PdfhK6mA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ajitx6bimaj7hd4pogul.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PdfhK6mA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ajitx6bimaj7hd4pogul.png" alt="Listning" width="688" height="181"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now add a root route for testing and open the server in your browser.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.get("/", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  res?.send("I am working.");
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gj9CaBEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kiyi8cy66kkb6yy1ko8j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Gj9CaBEP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kiyi8cy66kkb6yy1ko8j.png" alt="Testing" width="370" height="138"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add another route for Instagram posts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.get("/post/:id", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  const { id } = req?.params;
  if (id) {
    res.send(`Post id = ${id}`);
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now I will use the &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; package to scrape the response data. It will scrape the data from Instagram API as a simple string and then I'll parse that string into JSON.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.get("/post/:id", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  const { id } = req?.params;
  if (id) {
    const link = `https://www.instagram.com/p/${id}/?__a=1`;
    request(link, (err, response, html) =&amp;gt; {
      if (!err) {
        const json = JSON.parse(html);
        if (json) res.send(json);
      }
    });
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now if I look into my server with a valid Instagram post id I'll see something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HsGyyZmh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rmgpqct4r8gdmjo264fx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HsGyyZmh--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rmgpqct4r8gdmjo264fx.png" alt="Response" width="880" height="401"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am getting a lot of data but I need only a certain type of data.&lt;br&gt;
So I'll destructor it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const json = JSON.parse(html)?.graphql?.shortcode_media;
res?.send({
  id,
  mainContent: {
    displayUrl: json?.display_url,
    resolutions: json?.display_resources.map((item) =&amp;gt; ({
      src: item?.src,
    })),
  },
  user: {
    username: json?.owner?.username,
    isVerified: json?.owner?.is_verified,
    profilePic: json?.owner?.profile_pic_url,
  },
  caption: {
    main: json?.edge_media_to_caption.edges[0]?.node.text,
    accessibile: json?.accessibility_caption,
  },
  location: json?.location,
  comments: json?.edge_media_to_parent_comment?.count,
  likes: json?.edge_media_preview_like?.count,
  isVideo: json?.is_video,
  videoUrl: json?.video_url,
  allImages: json?.edge_sidecar_to_children?.edges?.map((item) =&amp;gt; ({
    displayUrl: item?.node?.display_url,
    resolutions: item?.node?.display_resources?.map((item) =&amp;gt; ({
      src: item?.src,
      size: item?.config_width,
    })),
  })),
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now its much clean and it gives me what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W_sCkY9X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zr6qtgm941jzv1s1u61v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--W_sCkY9X--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zr6qtgm941jzv1s1u61v.png" alt="Response" width="880" height="394"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can also destructor it according to your needs.&lt;br&gt;
I'll also do same for the user profile.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;app.get("/user/:username", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  const { username } = req?.params;
  if (username)
    const link = `https://www.instagram.com/${username}/?__a=1`;
    request(link, (err, response, html) =&amp;gt; {
      if (!err) {
        const json = JSON.parse(html)?.graphql?.user;
        if (json)
          res?.send({
            username,
            bio: json.biography,
            profilePic: {
              sd: json?.profile_pic_url,
              hd: json?.profile_pic_url_hd,
            },
            fullName: json?.full_name,
            following: json?.edge_followed_by.count,
            follows: json?.edge_follow.count,
            posts: {
              total: json?.edge_owner_to_timeline_media?.count,
              content: json?.edge_owner_to_timeline_media?.edges?.map(
                (item) =&amp;gt; ({
                  id: item?.node?.shortcode,
                  displayUrl: item?.node?.display_url,
                  caption: {
                    main: item?.node?.edge_media_to_caption.edges[0].node.text,
                    accessibile: item?.node?.accessibility_caption,
                  },
                  isVideo: item?.node?.is_video,
                  likes: item?.node?.edge_liked_by.count,
                  location: item?.node?.location,
                  comments: item?.node?.edge_media_to_comment.count,
                })
              ),
            },
          });
      }
    });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to use this API inside the frontend.&lt;br&gt;
I'll use &lt;code&gt;React JS&lt;/code&gt; as a frontend framework and &lt;code&gt;axios&lt;/code&gt; for fetching API in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll fetch this API and set images to &lt;code&gt;images&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
As you can see in this block of code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
  const [images, setImages] = useState();
  const getData = async () =&amp;gt; {
    const { data } = await axios("http://localhost:1234/post/CYa0_SRtUrf");
    if (data) {
      setImages(data);
      console.log(data);
    }
  };
  getData();
}, []);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now if I check the console there will be another CORS error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C_bXr7QW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dj4ho4u09lr3efsf6dee.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C_bXr7QW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dj4ho4u09lr3efsf6dee.png" alt="cors error" width="880" height="223"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this error install another npm package called &lt;code&gt;cros&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i cors
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now import it and use it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now It will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a0F7EkjT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s5kzd9aj3c7eojbr3ise.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--a0F7EkjT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s5kzd9aj3c7eojbr3ise.png" alt="response" width="880" height="332"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But now, if I try to display images inside my webpage, it will again give me an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--737ppwuq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7mdz7b17w8oss6t5myvm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--737ppwuq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7mdz7b17w8oss6t5myvm.png" alt="error" width="880" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is a bit difficult to deal with this error. But there are two ways to solve this problem. But I will show only the most convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem I'll convert to images I am getting from Instagram to base64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't know about base64 then it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data (more specifically, a sequence of 8-bit bytes) in an ASCII string format by translating the data into a radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding. Each non-final Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. Three bytes (i.e., a total of 24 bits) can therefore be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Source Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; : &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"&gt;Base64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To convert image to base64 first install another package called &lt;code&gt;image-to-base64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i image-to-base64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Import &lt;code&gt;image-to-base641&lt;/code&gt; and make a new asynchronous function &lt;code&gt;getBase64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const imageToBase64 = require("image-to-base64");

const getBase64 = async (link) =&amp;gt; {
  const base64 = await imageToBase64(link);
  return `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64}`;
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function will take the URL of the Instagram image and return it to the base64 code.&lt;br&gt;
Since this is an asynchronous function, I need to wait for the response.&lt;br&gt;
I have to change my code so that I get base64 in response.&lt;br&gt;
Here is the final code.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight plaintext"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const express = require("express");
const request = require("request");
const imageToBase64 = require("image-to-base64");
const cors = require("cors");

const PORT = 1234;

const app = express();
app.listen(PORT, () =&amp;gt; {
  console.clear();
  console.log(`Listing in http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

app.use(cors());

const getBase64 = async (link) =&amp;gt; {
  const base64 = await imageToBase64(link);
  return `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64}`;
};

app.get("/", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  res?.send("I am working.");
});

app.get("/post/:id", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  const { id } = req?.params;
  if (id) {
    const link = `https://www.instagram.com/p/${id}/?__a=1`;
    request(link, (err, response, html) =&amp;gt; {
      if (!err) {
        const json = JSON.parse(html)?.graphql?.shortcode_media;
        const promiseArray = json?.edge_sidecar_to_children?.edges?.map(
          async (item) =&amp;gt; ({
            displayUrl: await getBase64(item?.node?.display_url),
            resolutions: item?.node?.display_resources?.map((item) =&amp;gt; ({
              src: item?.src,
              size: item?.config_width,
            })),
          })
        );
        let allImages;
        if (promiseArray) allImages = Promise.all(promiseArray);
        if (json) {
          (async () =&amp;gt; {
            res?.send({
              id,
              mainContent: {
                displayUrl: await getBase64(json?.display_url),
                resolutions: json?.display_resources.map((item) =&amp;gt; ({
                  src: item?.src,
                })),
              },
              user: {
                username: json?.owner?.username,
                isVerified: json?.owner?.is_verified,
                profilePic: await getBase64(json?.owner?.profile_pic_url),
              },
              caption: {
                main: json?.edge_media_to_caption.edges[0]?.node.text,
                accessibile: json?.accessibility_caption,
              },
              location: json?.location,
              comments: json?.edge_media_to_parent_comment?.count,
              likes: json?.edge_media_preview_like?.count,
              isVideo: json?.is_video,
              videoUrl: json?.video_url,
              allImages: await allImages,
            });
          })();
        }
        if (!json) res?.status?.send("error");
      }
    });
  }
});
app.get("/user/:username", (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  const { username } = req?.params;
  if (username) {
    const link = `https://www.instagram.com/${username}/?__a=1`;
    request(link, (err, response, html) =&amp;gt; {
      if (!err) {
        const json = JSON.parse(html)?.graphql?.user;
        const promiseArray = json?.edge_owner_to_timeline_media?.edges?.map(
          async (item) =&amp;gt; ({
            displayUrl: await getBase64(item?.node?.display_url),
            resolutions: item?.node?.display_resources?.map((item) =&amp;gt; ({
              id: item?.node?.shortcode,
              displayUrl: item?.node?.display_url,
              caption: {
                main: item?.node?.edge_media_to_caption.edges[0].node.text,
                accessibile: item?.node?.accessibility_caption,
              },
              isVideo: item?.node?.is_video,
              likes: item?.node?.edge_liked_by.count,
              location: item?.node?.location,
              comments: item?.node?.edge_media_to_comment.count,
            })),
          })
        );
        let allImages;
        if (promiseArray) allImages = Promise.all(promiseArray);
        if (json)
          (async () =&amp;gt; {
            res?.send({
              username,
              bio: json.biography,
              profilePic: {
                sd: await getBase64(json?.profile_pic_url),
                hd: await getBase64(json?.profile_pic_url_hd),
              },
              fullName: json?.full_name,
              following: json?.edge_followed_by.count,
              follows: json?.edge_follow.count,
              posts: {
                total: json?.edge_owner_to_timeline_media?.count,
                content: await allImages,
              },
            });
          })();
        if (!json) res?.status(400).send("ERROR");
      }
    });
  }
  if (!username) res?.send(`Error`);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now if you try this API in the frontend it will perfectly work. I have build an Instagram Downloader web-app with the help of this API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the preview.&lt;br&gt;
Post&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mL7ebx0S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.ibb.co/TKrPVs6/download-page.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mL7ebx0S--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://i.ibb.co/TKrPVs6/download-page.png" alt="Download Page" width="880" height="495"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#end"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  End
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me tell you more about myself that it is my very first API. I don't know much about building an API. So if you don't like my code and want to give some feedback then feel free to suggest me in comments, and also check out my GitHub repo and contribute to make this API more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#bug-fixes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Bug Fixes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed priority on canvas styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed react/preact/inferno components exports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved image loading, now in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#improvements"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Improvements
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added all files for supporting the smaller engine file, preparing for v2 incoming changes. The engine file can be included or imported for a clean setup, and the plugins can be chosen manually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renamed &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; class to &lt;code&gt;Engine&lt;/code&gt;, kept backward compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved image loading, now they are loaded in parallel, and now if an image is missing, it will be loaded at runtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;a href="#breaking-changes"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Breaking Changes
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enums are not exported anymore, this breaks their javascript usages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>100 días de código: 51, avances obtenidos en vacaciones... Aunque se supone que eran vacaciones.</title>
      <author>Daro</author>

      <guid>https://dev.to/darito/100-dias-de-codigo-51-avances-obtenidos-en-vacaciones-aunque-se-supone-que-eran-vacaciones-l13</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;¡Hey hey hey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuando comenzaron mis vacaciones pensé que tomaría el tiempo para descansar pero jamas me imagine como terminaría...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En él, me encontré con un problema generado por las ocupaciones de familia, pareja y mis propios proyectos generado por falta de tiempo dedicado a estas ocupaciones y que debido a mis planes no tuve en cuenta en ningun momento. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No se si sera algo que le suceda a todos pero creo que la causa viene de que los programadores terminamos teniendo una estrecha relación entre vida personal y profesional que nos dificulta separar estas y dedicarle el tiempo necesario a cada una. Si piensas que te pasa algo similar te agradecería que me lo hicieras saber en los comentarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuando llego el día de año nuevo y yo me levante por la mañana un poco mas temprano solo para programar, me puse a reflexionar en que jamas me imagine que me entregaría a la programación de la forma en la que lo hago ya que incluso en vacaciones tomaba tiempo para dedicarme a escribir algo de código a diario. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo como no pude dedicarle el tiempo que me gustaría no lo tomare en cuenta para el reto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahora me gustaría relatar los acontecimientos y logros de mis vacaciones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Termine la mayoría de secciones de &lt;a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt; exceptuando el backend y las entrevistas y puedo decir que estoy muy contento con todo lo aprendido en el. &lt;br&gt;
Realmente se lo recomendaría a cualquier persona que tenga algunas nociones de desarrollo web aunque no se si a los que recién inician ya que puede ser un poco abrumador toda la información que va enseñando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comencé a crear los wireframes con ayuda de &lt;a href="https://www.autodraw.com/"&gt;autodraw.io&lt;/a&gt;. A pesar de que es una herramienta muy simple es poderosa por ello para la creatividad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comencé a aprender NextJs siguiendo la &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"&gt;guia de su propia pagina web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seguí practicando 15 min de Touch Typing a diario y aunque las velocidades de cada día son irregulares puedo decir con orgullo que un día obtuve 50 palabras por minuto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aprendí mas acerca de algunos frameworks css y preprocesadores como &lt;a href="https://postcss.org/"&gt;postcss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sass-lang.com/"&gt;sass&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"&gt;tailwind&lt;/a&gt; el cual esta siendo bastante popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analice algunas web y comencé a pensar en un proyecto propio que a lo mejor llevare a cabo para obtener experiencia comprobable por mi mismo antes de conseguir un trabajo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La verdad es que estoy muy contento con este inicio de año aunque comienzo a pensar que tal vez debería tomarme un descanso real para aligerar la carga de estrés y ansiedad que llevo acarreando estos meses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Espero que tengan un excelente año y que hayan disfrutado mucho las fiestas. Animo con sus proyectos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡Hasta luego!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Thoughts on Server State in Remix</title>
      <author>Zach Taylor</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:37:48 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://dev.to/zachtylr21/some-thoughts-on-server-state-in-remix-1fe5</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(you can also read this &lt;a href="https://zachdtaylor.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-server-state-in-remix"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a Remix meetup in Utah last night. At the meetup, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk in which he said that one great thing about Remix is that he doesn't have to think too much about state when using it. Afterwards, someone at the meetup asked me what he meant. It seems weird that you wouldn't have to think about state. Isn't state, like, a huge part of building an app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, it's important to know that it's not that you don't use state when building a Remix app. Rather, the framework just takes care of a lot of it for you. Here's what I mean by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge source of state in React applications is server state. The typical way to handle server state is to fetch it from the server with JavaScript and then use React Query or something similar to cache the resulting data client-side. All of that requires thought on your part. You need to understand how to use whatever caching library you're using. If you make a data mutation, you have to keep track of which queries/data to invalidate. You need to show error messages if there's an error. It's a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Remix, you don't have to think about any of that. All you have to do is return the data you need in your loaders and grab that data with &lt;code&gt;useLoaderData&lt;/code&gt;. When you send a mutation, you don't have to invalidate anything; the data on the page gets updated automatically. When you define &lt;code&gt;CatchBoundary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ErrorBoundary&lt;/code&gt; components for error handling, you don't have to think about when to render them; Remix will render them at the right time for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how exactly does this work? Where does Remix store the data for the page? And how does Remix know when to update it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't have JavaScript on the page, then there's nowhere for Remix to store the data. The HTML page itself is effectively the "store", and when you mutate data with a form, the page is refreshed, a server-side render happens, and you get refreshed data. This is how browsers work by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have JavaScript on the page, then Remix stores your data in a global context and provides a few ways for you to access it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first way, as mentioned, is &lt;code&gt;useLoaderData&lt;/code&gt;. This hook will grab the data returned by the loader for the specific route you call the hook from. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight typescript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// routes/recipies.tsx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;loader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;LoaderFunction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// return some data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Recipies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This will grab the data returned from the above loader.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;useLoaderData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Or, you could move the `useLoaderData` inside&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// `RecipieCard` instead of passing `data` as a prop.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Since the `Recipies` route is the closest to&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// `RecipieCard` in the component tree, &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// you'll get this loader's data.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;RecipieCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sr"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second way is &lt;code&gt;useMatches&lt;/code&gt;. This hook will give you all the data for every route that matches the current URL, so you can grab the data for any route that is currently rendered on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a third way that &lt;a href="https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/1281"&gt;might be added&lt;/a&gt; to Remix in the near future, called &lt;code&gt;useRouteData&lt;/code&gt;. This hook will allow you to get data from a specific route by passing a route id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also grab data from any loader (even ones that are not part of the current route) with &lt;code&gt;useFetcher().load&lt;/code&gt;. However, unlike &lt;code&gt;useLoaderData&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;useMatches&lt;/code&gt;, this data will not come from the global context and instead, &lt;code&gt;useFetcher().load&lt;/code&gt; will send a network request to get the data and store it locally, just like you might do with &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you submit a form with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Form /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or call an action with &lt;code&gt;useFetcher().submit&lt;/code&gt;, Remix will call all the loaders for the current route and update the global context for you. You don't have to think about it! What's cool about this is that Remix is just emulating regular browser behavior here. Again, if there were no JavaScript on the page, the browser would do a full page refresh, which would call all the loaders for the current route, and you'd get a fresh HTML document with fresh data. This is exactly what Remix is doing, just with JavaScript so there's no page refresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for error handling, all you have to do is export an &lt;code&gt;ErrorBoundary&lt;/code&gt; component for unexpected errors, and a &lt;code&gt;CatchBoundary&lt;/code&gt; component for errors you throw yourself, and if there are any errors, Remix will display the error UI in place of the regular UI for that route automatically, without you having to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing things the Remix way does require a bit of a mindset shift. You have to think about data and errors in terms of your routes. Whenever you call &lt;code&gt;useLoaderData&lt;/code&gt;, you will get the data for the nearest route in the component tree. The &lt;code&gt;ErrorBoundary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CatchBoundary&lt;/code&gt; display in place of the UI for whatever route they're defined in. But reframing things in terms of routes enables a lot, and it's what makes Remix so special and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>houry: A Simple Python App That Beeps Every Hour</title>
      <author>Sergey</author>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:10:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://dev.to/skaplichniy/houry-a-simple-python-app-that-beeps-every-hour-2pb</link>
      <guid>https://dev.to/skaplichniy/houry-a-simple-python-app-that-beeps-every-hour-2pb</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, in the ‘pre-Apple-Watch’ era, I had a &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Casio_F-91W"&gt;Casio F-91W&lt;/a&gt;. It was a very cheap watch, but it had a nice feature. There was a special setting that allowed it to &lt;em&gt;beep every hour&lt;/em&gt;. And that was amazing! It was like a special notification for me to notice the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I heard a beep, I wondered if the thing I was doing was distracting me or helping me? In other words, that beep was very useful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I bought the Apple Watch and the magic disappeared. I tried to find an app on my phone or laptop that would beep every hour, but could not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;let's bring the magic back!&lt;/strong&gt; I am going to use Python to create a little app for my computer with OS X that will make a sound every hour. Let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to teach our app to understand the time and play a sound. Google says these libraries should help with that:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;playsound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;playsound&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let’s find the sound. Go to &lt;a href="https://www.soundjay.com/"&gt;Soundjay&lt;/a&gt; and choose something you like. I chose this &lt;a href="https://www.soundjay.com/buttons/sounds/beep-07a.mp3"&gt;beep-sound&lt;/a&gt; and saved it to my project folder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;beep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;playsound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'/beep.wav'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let’s play it every hour at 00 minutes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;":00"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;beep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And as the documentation says, I should add this to make a loop:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run_pending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s try it. Everything works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to make it a standalone app for my Mac. But I don’t like it to show up in the dock or menu bar. I just want it to run in the background, so here are some magic words for the setup.py file:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;setuptools&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;APP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'houry.py'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;DATA_FILES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'argv_emulation'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'iconfile'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'icon.icns'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;'plist'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'CFBundleShortVersionString'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;'0.2.0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;'LSUIElement'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;APP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data_files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'beep.wav'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'py2app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup_requires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;'py2app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I created an icon for this app. Yes, you will only see it when you run this app, but I still wanted it to look nice. So I just took an emoji from &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;, converted it via &lt;a href="https://anyconv.com/png-to-icns-converter/"&gt;Anyconv&lt;/a&gt;, and saved it in the main folder of my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last step. To create an app, we should type this in the Terminal:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight js-code-highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre class="highlight python"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;py2app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Now you can find your app in the ‘dist’ folder. Do not forget to move it to the ‘Application’ folder and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201476"&gt;add it to Login Options&lt;/a&gt; on your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy houry!&lt;/p&gt;
